1814995 author: James LaCourt:  . Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report. I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament and share the rapporteurs commitment to equal opportunities in the fisheries sector. I also share her opinion that the participation of womens networks is particularly important in this context.  In the next programming period,  20072013 , the Commission will attach great importance to promoting the role of women in the fisheries sector. The proposed European Fisheries Fund reflects the Commissions commitment to equal opportunities. The future fund is even more specific about the role of women in fisheries than the current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance. The integration of the gender perspective is promoted during the various stages of implementing the Fund. We will ask the Member States to ensure that operations to enhance the role of women in the fisheries sector are promoted. The report under consideration calls on the Commission to provide active support for existing womens networks and the creation of new networks.  I am very pleased to inform you that the European Fisheries Fund proposal will support specific actions like networking and the exchange of experience and best practice among organisations promoting equal opportunities between men and women.  For the next programming period, the Commission suggests including the actions relating to networking and the exchange of experiences among organisations promoting equal opportunities in the Member States operational programmes. This replaces our past approach of launching calls for proposals for innovative actions directly managed by the Commission. We believe that this option will have more added value than funding smallscale projects, which was the case under the innovative actions formula.  An expost evaluation of transnational projects for innovative actions was conducted in  2005 . One of the main findings of the evaluation was that the operational programme projects were more highly performing than the innovative action projects. The evaluation also showed that the EU added value of the innovative actions, as well as the exchange of experiences and good practices were fairly limited.  In your report you called on the Commission to promote more vocational training and education specifically geared to the activities of women working in the sector. I am pleased to announce that the European Fisheries Funds new priority  the sustainable development of fisheries areas  will make an important contribution to these needs.  Support can be granted for the diversification of activities and the promotion of multiple employment opportunities for fishers outside the sector. Measures, such as the promotion and the improvement of professional skills, worker adaptability and access to employment, particularly in favour of women, are foreseen. The measures aimed at the diversification of economic activities, as well as education and professional training, will be of particular benefit for women in fisheriesdependent areas.  The Commission also shares with you the concern about the difficulty in recruiting young people in the fisheries sector. The sector suffers from a poor image with the younger generation and an effort has to be made to attract young people to join the profession. In this regard under the European Fisheries Fund, we are considering more incentives for young fishers, in addition to the measures already foreseen under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance such as training, including training on health and safety, and the upgrading of professional skills. There will also be limited assistance offered under the EFF for firsttime young fishers entering the profession. In addition, there will be increased possibilities for the participation of women in the decisionmaking process.  The new priority sustainable development of fisheries areas will be implemented through a bottomup approach. The local actors, including womens associations, will be the motor in designing and implementing the local development strategies. This new approach is a further opportunity for women at local level to get involved in decisionmaking and to ensure that their specific concerns are taken into account in the local development strategies. Likewise, for the establishment of the National Strategic Plans, a wide partnership with all relevant actors, including womens representatives, is foreseen. Womens organisations should therefore give their input for the analysis of the trends in the fisheries sector and the development of a strategy for its sustainable development.  Women and their representatives are also encouraged to participate in the regional advisory councils, which are the cornerstone of the governance pillar of the reformed common fisheries policy. For instance, womens associations already have a seat in the North Sea RAC, which was the first to be created as a result of the common fisheries policy reform in  2002 . Women are also represented in the North Western Waters RAC.  Finally, following the conference on the role of women in fisheries organised in January  2003 , I am pleased to inform you that the Commission is planning to organise another conference on equal opportunities in  2006 . This conference will take stock of the situation of women in the fisheries sector and reflect on ways further to improve the situation and make further progress. I hope that the views of this Parliament will also find reflection in the proceedings of the conference.  In conclusion, I would like to underline the Commissions determination to attribute great importance to equal opportunities in our policy. However, in order to make equal opportunities a reality, all policymaking levels need to take responsibility: the Commission, and national as well as regional and local levels. Your own commitment to this objective will assist in keeping and furthering the importance given to equal opportunities at all levels.
5109042 author: Victor Reid:  . Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Member for her report on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea. The funding proposed by this regulation will be an essential part of the fisheries financial perspectives package for  20072013 . Next to the European Fisheries Fund, this regulation represents the legal basis for most other expenditure allowing the continuation of the common fisheries policy and, based on the Commissions original proposal for a financial perspective, it will cover more than EUR 2 . 5  billion worth of spending in the seven year period from  20072013 .  The proposal aims to provide a more transparent and simplified framework for the execution of Community financial interventions. It is geared towards improving the effectiveness of financial interventions in the field of control and enforcement, in the area of data collection and scientific advice, in the strengthening of the governance of the common fisheries policy, and in the area of international relations and the Law of the Sea.  Let me now turn to the amendments proposed in the report before us. The Commission can accept Amendment 1  and will continue to do what is possible within its competence to work towards ensuring the sustainability of the resources in third countries.  Whereas the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of Amendment 2 , it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment. The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the crucial aspect of control capacities of third counties. Furthermore, the Commission plans to concentrate on developing common objectives with third countries, rather than prescribing to them detailed means as to how to get to those objectives as different countries have different needs.  Amendments  3  to  8  should be considered together with Amendment 17 , since they quote objectives which were already covered in the Councils conclusions of  19 July  2004 , regarding fisheries partnership agreements. However, the legal provisions of this regulation are not the right place for policy statements. The Commission therefore considers that a reference to these conclusions in the recitals of the proposed regulation, as proposed by Amendment 17 , is the most appropriate way to include these aspects and can therefore accept Amendment 17 . As a consequence, the scope of Amendments 3  to  8  will be covered through this recital.  Since the Natura  2000  network falls under the Communitys environmental policy, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 9  in a regulation which exclusively concerns the common fisheries policy. The Commission will, however, ensure coherence of the common fisheries policy with environmental objectives.  For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 10 . In the framework of fisheries partnership agreements, the Council conclusions referred to earlier require coherence between the objectives of the CFP and the objectives of other Community policies such as environmental objectives.  The Commission appreciates the support the Committee on Fisheries has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate towards the regional advisory councils. The proposed Amendment 11  clearly sets out the desire of the Committee to see the role of the regional advisory councils facilitated through indefinite funding. Whereas the Commission is willing to explore options for funding beyond the currently prescribed fiveyear period, a commitment cannot be made at this stage since this would not be in line with the current regulation that has established the regional advisory councils, but this request can be reconsidered in the first evaluation of the functioning of the regional advisory councils three years after their establishment.  On the cost of commissioning scientific advice, the Commission is already paying independent and credible bodies to deliver the scientific advice. RACs are welcome to highlight to the Commission any need for scientific advice. However, the Commission reserves its right to decide on the justification of such a request on a casebycase basis and will lead the process of obtaining this advice.  Although the Commission is in agreement in principle on the substance of Amendment 12 , it has difficulty accepting the form of such an amendment. The proposed amendment could have the effect of restricting the scope of what is designed to be a broad and general paragraph dealing with the objectives for fisheries partnership agreements. Value for money is just one of the principles mentioned in the Council conclusions of  19 July 2004  regarding fisheries partnership agreements, and it should not be highlighted individually to the detriment of the other principles and objectives defined in the Council.  The Commission has difficulty in accepting Amendment 13 . Most of the aspects mentioned in the amendment are covered either by the Council conclusions on fisheries partnership agreements, or by the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.  The Commission agrees on the substance of Amendment 14 , but not on the form. In principle, the Commission agrees to provide summaries and aggregations of the collected data on request or for specific needs, but it is not planned at this point automatically to issue this data in the form of a periodic publication or report.  Amendment 15  cannot be accepted by the Commission, as fisheries partnership agreements are in essence based on a commercial relationship. The third country is responsible for and sovereign to spend its revenue under the agreement, in whole or in part, in support of its fisheries policy for the purposes jointly agreed in a common approach with the Community. The parties will jointly review the results obtained by this policy. However, in this context, the Commission cannot impose financial audits or onthespot checks on third countries without their agreement.  For similar reasons, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 16 . Each fisheries partnership agreement contains provisions on the payment of funds, as well as on the use of the share of these funds foreseen for the fisheries policy of the third country. On the basis of indicators and benchmarks, both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and, where appropriate, will make the necessary adjustments. As regards its national budget and financial administration, however, the third country is sovereign.  As said before, the Commission can accept Amendment 17 .  Concerning Amendment 18 , the Commission welcomes the support from Parliament to reinforce the budget for the common fisheries policy in the course of the negotiations on the  20072013  financial perspective. The proposed regulation, by definition, can be adopted only once the financial perspective has, hopefully, been agreed. Therefore, adding a recital, as proposed in this amendment, is probably obsolete.  The Commission agrees on the substance of Amendment 19 , but not on the form. Smallscale fisheries, as part of the catching sector, are already included as RAC members by virtue of the RAC decision. Thus the Commission already promotes their participation in RACs as full members.
5008921 author: Annette MacLeod:  . Mr President, I should like to thank all colleagues for their support so far for my report. This report replaces a number of existing legal measures which provide the basis for current funding beyond monies provided by the European Fisheries Fund. This is in line with the policy of achieving better regulation and simplification of legislation. It sets out objectives for: expenditure, rules for eligibility of expenditure, the level of the Commission contribution and control measures. The key areas covered are: control and enforcement, data collection, scientific advice, governance of the CFP and international matters. The total budget foreseen for  20072013  is EUR 2625  million, although the actual amounts, as the Commissioner has said, will depend on the EU budget negotiations.  On control and enforcement, the aim is to improve the control of fishing activities in order to combat those fishing activities that are damaging the conservation of resources within and outside Community waters. This is to be achieved by providing Community financial support to Member States to reduce weaknesses in their fisheries control programmes and by assisting coordination of control measures, particularly via the Community Fisheries Control Agency.  Within the area of data collection and scientific advice, Community support will allow for the collection and management of the data needed to evaluate the state of fisheries resources and the fishing industry within and outside Community waters. This will assist the Member States to establish multiannual, aggregated and sciencebased data sets which incorporate biological, environmental and economic information.  In the area of governance, the goal is to ensure the involvement of stakeholders at all stages of policy development up to and including implementation.  In the area of international relations and the law of the sea, Community financial support is given for the conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries, including partnership agreements, and participation in international organisations relating to fisheries or the law of the sea. This area is allocated the lions share of the budget  EUR 1592 . 5  million, of which EUR 1522 . 5  million will go to fisheries agreements. In addition, some money has been allocated to technical and administrative assistance, including related staff costs.  However, although the sums allocated by the Commission have been increased in committee, MEPs expressed concern that the allocation would not cover all the tasks required. These have been increased by enlargement and the need to collect data on the new seas  for example, current data on the Black Sea scarcely exists.  Uncertainty over funding  not least as we await a new EU budget  poses the question of whether more funds can be made available, and if so, how they should be allocated. If more funding is not available, then the question of whether funding is appropriately allocated by this proposal arises.  The creation of RACs is a vital and most welcome development. They will play a key role in the management of the CFP. However, we need to ensure that the RAC areas are adequately supported. They are unlikely to generate sufficient resources of their own after the startup phase and, indeed, the operating costs are certain to increase after the startup phase, as the RACs and their working groups  the North Sea RAC already has four of them  progressively generate and implement new projects in support of management guidance to the Commission. Even in the startup phase, the level of support to the RACs from the Commission diminishes progressively and steeply and continues to do so, year on year, as the RAC itself is expected to become increasingly selfsupporting. Moreover, the secretariats of the RACs have only limited capacity to seek alternative sources of funding, notably from Member States.  There is only limited opportunity  or justification  to pass the burden of cost on to the stakeholders  members of the general assembly and executive committees  especially as individual stakeholders  such as NGOs  seek to be involved in several RACs simultaneously, which incurs significant resource costs. It is vital to press for finance to be available for RACs beyond the initial fiveyear period.  The financial support for the collection of data on the impact of fisheries on the environment in relation to adopting an ecosystembased approach is also important. Almost  60  of all the money goes on international fishing agreements, and it is only right that we make sure this amounts to value for money and is a fair development.  Expenditure on agreements should be eligible for Community financing only if it has been recommended as value for money under an evaluation report on the relevant agreement. It is also important to develop control capacities of third countries to ensure sustainable fishing monitoring and control of fishing activities.  If cuts need to be made in the Commissions indicative budget, savings should be found from the international relations area, the largest budget area.  I thank colleagues for their support and urge them to support this report tomorrow, and I wish everybody a Happy Christmas.
3074278 author: Katarina McNabb:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by saying  on the previous point made by Mr Casaca  that when preparing the allocation of grants, the Commission examines the requests submitted by Member States, taking into account the needs and efficiencies of each Member State, as they result mainly from the national programme and from the earlier report on control activities, which each Member State must transmit to the Commission. Priority is given to those investments which are deemed more costeffective, bearing in mind the general interest in achieving a high level of control throughout the Community. Therefore, priority may change over the years and be different for different Member States.  I totally agree with Mr Kindermann that control and enforcement is a cornerstone of the effectiveness of the common fisheries policy. I am committed to continuing to strengthen control and enforcement activities. The establishment of the control agency this year will certainly make an important contribution in this area.  On the points raised by Mrs Attwooll, Mr Crowley and other speakers with regard to the whole question of sanctions, let me say that the main trend, as published in the communication, shows that the total number of serious infringements has varied considerably from one year to another  from  4180  in  2000  to  9502  in  2003 . It is difficult to know if this increase in the infringements detected means that the rate of detection of serious infringements is improving or if the number of infringements committed has increased.  One notable element of progress with regard to deterrence is the fact that the average amount of fines imposed has increased from EUR  1757  in  2002  to EUR  4664  in  2003   that is an increase in one year of  165 . However, the fact that fines imposed in  2003  amount to only  0 . 004  of the value of landings in  2002 , makes us think that fines remain too modest to represent a real deterrent for rule breakers. Having said that, this is a general statement, and one would have to look into the various subsectors and offences with regard to which these fines have been imposed.  Some conclusions from the previous communications are, firstly, that there are substantial differences between the average penalties applied  as a number of Members have made clear tonight  and that the amount of penalties remains too low to represent an effective deterrent against noncompliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.  Regarding whether criminal procedures or administrative procedures are the best option, Article  25  of Regulation (EC) No 23712002  foresees that Member States are to take appropriate measures against responsible persons when the common fisheries rules have not been respected.  Member States can prosecute infringements through criminal or administrative procedures, provided that these measures are effective and proportionate to the seriousness of the infringements. The Commission cannot otherwise interfere in the choice of the instrument by individual Member States. This could touch upon the sensitive issue of state sovereignty.  Having said that, I repeat that it is the Commissions view that administrative procedures  and thus administrative sanctions  are preferable. They are preferable because they can be imposed swiftly by an administrative authority, as this does not require the lengthy process involved in establishing liability before sanctions can be imposed in criminal proceedings. They are less expensive than judicial proceedings. Noncriminal sanctions can be swiftly imposed and have been seen to be more effective than more severe penal sanctions. For instance, an administrative sanction, such as suspension of a fishing permit, may be an effective way to encourage compliance, as it can be applied quickly. I regret that the majority of Member States do not use this tool more often.  The sanction  be it criminal or administrative  must be tailored to the seriousness of the infringement. Mitigating or aggravating factors include: a negative impact of the violation on fisheries resources or type of fish; previous conduct of the violators; repetition of the same infringement; and the estimated economic benefits deriving from the infringement.  The Commission has launched a consultation process on improving the quality of data collected and reported and the analysis of this data, in order to compare the situation between Member States. Furthermore, the Commission intends to propose a catalogue of sanctions to be imposed in cases of serious infringements, for adoption by the Council, as foreseen in Article  25 ( 4 ) of Council Regulation (EC) No 23712002 . The catalogue should help to increase the level of sanctions and contribute to the establishment of a more level playing field. This catalogue is scheduled to be presented by the Commission in the second half of  2007 .  As I have already said, the discrepancies are, therefore, large and our preference is for administrative sanctions, since they are more effective and can be implemented quickly.  In reply to a specific point that was made, I would say that our proposal for the harmonisation of sanctions for serious infringements will be published in  2007 . We hope that this will create a more level playing field and, at the same time, address the issue of proportionality.  With regard to the last point, which was raised by Mr Casaca, concerning Amendments 2  and  6 , I apologise. The information that I have is that these amendments were not supported in committee. However, I will look into this and contact him tomorrow before the vote.
9408155 author: Frederic McNabb:  . Mr President, before I outline the Commissions position on this dossier let me first extend my gratitude to the Committee on Fisheries, and especially to its Chairman and rapporteur Mr Morillon for his excellent work carried out within the very tight deadlines.  As you are all aware, the Commission procedures have delayed the finalisation of this proposal. The Commission is endeavouring to prevent similar delays occurring in the future. We are currently undertaking internal consultations to see how best to overcome the delays which result in very short timeframes being given to the European Parliament to consider the reports. I hope to be able to report to the Committee on Fisheries on possible solutions in the near future. In the meantime I want to apologise to the rapporteur for the very tight deadlines he had to work within, and I personally commit myself to discuss with him and to search for and find a solution with regard to the future modus operandi.  On this dossier I would like to say that we informed the Seychelles authorities of the delay in the adoption procedure at an early stage. The Seychelles authorities have shown great understanding.  As the honourable Members are aware, the Community has a longstanding relation with the Seychelles in the fisheries area. The first fisheries agreement with the country dates back to  1985  and this is one of the most important tuna agreements in financial terms. It is also the cornerstone of the network of our tuna agreements in the Indian Ocean.  This new Protocol is the first one that fully reflects the new partnership approach. Both parties subscribe to a political dialogue on fisheries issues and in particular the fisheries sector policy defined by the Government of the Seychelles. More than one third of the financial contribution has been earmarked in support of the Seychelles fisheries policy.  In line with this desire, the Commission has had a joint committee meeting in April and two technical meetings in July and September  2005  with the Seychelles authorities in order to start the political dialogue on the establishment of a multiannual sector programme to support the development of responsible fisheries in the Seychelles. This work includes the establishment of annual and multiannual objectives, the distribution of a part of the financial compensation, the aims to be attained and criteria and procedures to be followed, in order to allow for an evaluation of the yearly results obtained in accordance with Article 7  of the Protocol. In this manner, both parties are firmly committed to responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in the Seychelles waters.  The new Protocol covers a sixyear period from  18 January  2005  to  17 January  2011 . It grants fishing opportunities for  40 tuna seiners and  12 surface longliners and foresees a financial contribution of EUR 4125000  per year. The Protocol is of mutual benefit to both parties.  I shall now turn to the amendments. On Amendment 1  we fully share Parliaments concern and appreciate the speedy procedure undertaken notwithstanding the short timeframes given to them. As I said before, the Commission informed the Seychelles authorities of this delay at an early stage. The Seychelles authorities have shown great understanding and have accepted to receive the payment of the financial compensation for the first year of the agreement at a later date.  As I have stated above, the delays in the transmission result mainly from the nature of negotiations, but also because of the length of time involved in internal procedures. In view of this and of my commitment to find a solution, I seek the rapporteurs understanding of our inability to accept this amendment.  On Amendment 2 , as stated in Article 7  of the Protocol, it is up to the coastal state, in agreement with the Community, to decide on the way the financial contribution will be used in support of its fisheries policy. It is therefore the responsibility of the Seychelles authorities to identify the main priorities of their fisheries policy to be implemented with the assistance of the Fisheries Protocol. Therefore I am unable to accept this amendment.  As regards Amendments 3  and  5 , the Commission is entirely in agreement with their spirit. However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information, in line with both the current interinstitutional arrangements and in particular with the framework agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament. The Commission therefore considers that these amendments are not really necessary, if my information is right.  Amendment 4  cannot be accepted by the Commission. May I recall the basic Community provisions concerning the mandate of the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Community. The Council has authorised the Commission to negotiate fisheries arrangements between the Community and the Seychelles. Against this background, the periodic renewal does not require a new mandate each time. There is no need for a new mandate, given that the existing mandate covers these negotiations objectives.  On Amendment 6 , the new Protocol does not contain any targeted measures but a support to the Seychelles fisheries policy  Article  7  of the Protocol promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in Seychelles waters. We fully share the concern to keep the EP informed on the various aspects of the implementation of the Protocol. However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of such information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements. Therefore the Commission considers that this amendment is not really necessary.
588779 author: Christoph Bauer:  . Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for finding time today to debate the security of energy supplies and particularly gas. In a way, it is a continuation of the debate we had on high oil prices last year. The current price of oil is more than USD  60  per barrel.  The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia triggered the debate on the security of supply to the European Union. The gas dispute hit the headlines at the beginning of this year when Russia stopped its supply to Ukraine for a day and a half. That also had an impact on the EU through a reduction in the amount of gas reaching the European Union.  While it is reassuring in the short term that an agreement was reached between Ukraine and Russia, we must be under no illusions. The issue has not gone away. Commercial negotiations between the two sides will continue in order to find a price adjustment formula that is mutually acceptable. We have also seen the repercussions internally in Ukraine, with the vote of no confidence in the government last week. Nor must we forget that the gas price dispute between Russia and Moldova was resolved only yesterday, with more detailed negotiations in the near future. I firmly believe that everyone needs to learn the lessons from the events at the beginning of the year.  So, what are the lessons the EU should draw from this dispute? Firstly, in the context of this particular dispute, the EU was, and should be, proactive. We not only maintained close bilateral contacts with both parties throughout the dispute but also urged them to resolve this dispute. While it is evident that the EU could not and should not take sides, we made it clear to both sides that it was in their strong interest to come to an agreement rapidly. In such a situation it is very important to have close cooperation between the Council  in particular the Presidency  and the Commission.  Secondly, the dispute has underlined the usefulness of the energy dialogues with Russia and Ukraine. Those dialogues have provided us with the contacts necessary to impress our concerns and views upon both parties in a framework of mutual trust and common interest. At the same time, it clearly underlines the need to give greater momentum to dialogue.  Thirdly, this dispute has underlined the importance of and the need for a clearer, more cohesive and proactive EUwide energy security policy. While it is true that the Commission and Parliament have argued for this for many years, the time is now right to make real progress on this.  I should like to stress the importance of developing a common approach to energy, which was highlighted at the Hampton Court informal summit and in the meeting between the Presidency and the Commission at the start of the Austrian Presidency. In his speech today, the PresidentinOffice clearly indicated the importance the Presidency attaches to this particular issue and that many concrete and clear proposals have been made.  During the crisis we witnessed a certain lack of transparency in the European gas market that has made it quite challenging to monitor and assess accurately how this shortfall was being handled. The  2004  directive concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supplies, once fully transposed, should assist. Addressing those kinds of issues is one of the objectives of the energy market observation system which is under development in my services.  More generally, this incident has thrown into sharp focus our increasing dependency on external energy supply. The necessity of adopting and developing a common EU approach will be addressed in a green paper on energy policy that the Commission is currently preparing. Clearly, the development of a common approach to the external energy dimension will be a fundamental element in the green paper.  This external energy dimension should be based on a diversification of different energies, as well as on different energy sources, routes, suppliers and transit networks. There is a clear need for more investment in LNG terminals, in gas pipelines for diversification of supplies and gas storage facilities.  While the EU has been engaged, via its technical assistance programmes, in promoting the development of new supply routes, and upgrading and enhancing existing routes, it is clear that other major energy consumers also take a very proactive and political approach to this issue. Europe will have to learn some lessons here, although one should not underestimate the complexity of this task.  There are also, of course, the internal aspects of an EU energy policy to consider: firstly, the need to ensure that an internal EUwide energy market is a practical reality. There is still some way to go to achieve a real internal market in both electricity and gas. Then there is the need to facilitate the necessary infrastructure investments required to ensure that the various national energy markets in the EU can really become more integrated. Here it is important for us all to recognise that this calls for the necessary means also to be provided including, where necessary, financial support.  We also need to ensure that sufficient policy and financial support is given to research in priority areas and to ensure that more efficient energy technologies, including cleaner coal and renewable energy technologies, can penetrate the market. We need more actively to pursue policies and measures that can achieve real energy savings and efficient use of energy and thus diminish our external dependency.  We have adopted ambitious legislation. Now it is time to implement it.  Finally, we need to improve energy security measures to enhance the solidarity mechanisms to face the challenges of possible disruptions to energy supplies. One should keep in mind that this particular dispute, as it affected the EU, was resolved in a very short time, but we must be prepared for longerlasting disputes.  In conclusion, this dispute has again been a real wakeup call for us all. While it is true that energy is just a commodity, it is a commodity that is fundamental for our continued economic development and wellbeing. We must learn the lessons from this episode, which I will sum up as a need for a common European energy policy. This policy needs to be clear, coherent and effective both internally and externally, corresponding to the goals of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.
9299879 author: Helen Cameron:  . Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank MrDaul, Mr Barn Crespo, Mr Fazakas and MrsMorgantini for their proactive involvement in this dossier, and to praise the impressive work accomplished by the rapporteurs, Mr Fruteau, MrGlattfelder, MrWynn and Mrs Kinnock. Let me also thank the members of the Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development, International Trade, Budgetary Control and Development for their strong commitment, their helpful input and the very constructive debate. These impressive contributions certainly have produced results. The reform of the common market organisation that has remained practically unchanged for almost four decades is a major undertaking; in fact this reform is long overdue.  Sugar policy has many facets. The list of legitimate interests that need to be met is very long: the hundreds of thousands of farmers who grow sugar beet in the community; the sugar producing and consuming industries and their workers; the consumers; and, last but not least, our trade partners, including those countries enjoying longstanding preferences. From the beginning, I have been aware of the need to strike a fine balance between the different needs and the different demands.  As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, I am fully aware of the social, economic and environmental relevance of the sugar sector, both inside and outside the Community. That makes sugar policy particularly challenging, which is why I have committed myself so deeply to the reform of this sector.  I believe that the present proposals in their entirety respond to the needs of the Community. They are the result of careful reflection and are in tune in the CAP reform package and our international commitments. We have been ambitious and farreaching. I am convinced that the future of the sugar sector cannot be based on shortterm approaches.  The reform package seeks to give the European sugar sector a viable and competitive future. It offers longterm certainty and generous assistance to help both farmers and sugar producers with the process of adjustment. By acting now, we will have the funds available to ease the painful restructuring process that is absolutely vital and at the same time compensate our farmers. Delaying this necessary reform would result in nothing but a more drastic reduction of Community production and a much more severe restructuring process. We also need to ensure the compliance of the future regime with the WTO panel, and our proposal fulfils that requirement.  Finally, we have to ensure that the European Union remains an attractive market for developing countries, and offer our ACP partners the necessary financial assistance to adapt to these unavoidable changes. Much useful work has been done since the first communication from the Commission was presented in the summer of  2004 , both in the European Parliament and in the Council. As a result, today we have the contours of a reform that has to a very large extent been shaped by Parliament. Most obvious is that the entire reform is built on the basis of a restructuring fund, which was an idea originally introduced by the European Parliament in the report by MrFruteau and Mr Daul at the beginning of last year.  There are many other examples of the European Parliaments influence on this reform: the retention of the intervention system during a transitional period; the reduction of the price cuts and its extension over a fouryear period with a generous compensation scheme; all the measures taken to more adequately ensure the management of supply; the possibilities of making a real difference in those areas that will be most affected by the restructuring; and the allocation of the restructuring aid, of which at least  10  would be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors an amount that could be increased by Member States according to their specific situations. All these fingerprints show that we have had collaboration that has gone beyond the expression of intention and has delivered a real political result.  I want to express my sincere thanks to the European Parliament for its cooperation.
3520216 author: Annette Smith:  . Mr President, PresidentinOffice, honourable Members, I am most grateful for this opportunity to give the Commissions view on the future of Chechnya after the elections. It is positive, as the Presidency mentioned, that the elections took place without violence, even if one cannot ignore the deficiencies in the process. Three parties received sufficient support to be represented in the new parliament, with the proKremlin United Russia far outweighing the others. We hope that this constitutes a step towards greater political representation, greater stability and eventually peaceful democracy.  Neither the OSCE nor the Council of Europe sent a fully fledged observer mission, since the conditions on the ground did not permit it, but the latter did send an eightmember factfinding mission. We therefore have no official reports, but we are aware of statements by members of the latter mission and by other organisations drawing attention, in particular, to deficiencies in the process, and we expect such allegations to be properly investigated.  While we welcome the Russian Federal authorities commitment to allocate significant funds for reconstruction, a number of other actions need to be taken if these elections are to be a step towards more peace and democracy. Although there appears to have been an improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, unfortunately a culture of impunity remains. Reported cases of disappearances and torture should be fully investigated and the perpetrators, including members of the law enforcement authorities, brought to justice.  We note that Russia has expressed its willingness to cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms including, for instance, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Louise Arbour. These assurances should be put into practice and there should be cooperation with the UN Special Rapporteurs. It is also important that the local ombudsman in Chechnya be seen to be carrying out his duties impartially, as well as effectively.  As has already been mentioned, I would like to emphasise that the European Commission is playing its part in the region. We have agreed a EUR 20 million programme for socioeconomic recovery in the North Caucasus, because we believe that to be one of the root causes of that conflict. This is in addition to humanitarian assistance, for which we are already the biggest donor through ECHO. This gives a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region.  Our programme will help support the muchneeded rehabilitation of the health and education sectors and assist in jobcreation and incomegeneration activities. In my former capacity as Austrian Foreign Minister I visited Chechnya as chairwoman of the OSCE. I remember my visit very well. We saw health establishments at first hand and a lot of improvement is indeed necessary.  It is also our intention to open an office in the North Caucasus region, possibly in Vladikavkaz, which would help us to monitor the implementation of our programme and keep us better informed on the situation on the ground.  I should, however, express our concern at the continuing difficulties that NGOs have to face  as the Presidency mentioned  including those receiving support from the European Commission, such as the RussianChechen Friendship Society in Nizhny Novgorod. This also affects NGOs delivering humanitarian assistance under the ECHO programme.  In that context I should like to draw your attention to the recent amendments to Russian legislation on NGOs. We expressed our concerns about the effect of that legislation on NGOs financed under ECHO in the North Caucasus through the EIDHR and TACIS programmes to the chairwoman of the Presidential Council on the development of social society and human rights. I also discussed the matter with the Foreign Minister, MrLavrov, who assured me that there would be changes to the proposal at second reading in the Duma. The text of the legislation finally approved by the Duma does indeed take some account of concerns expressed by the European Union and the Council of Europe, which we welcome. However, we remain concerned that some of the provisions remain too farreaching  for example the scope for denying registration to local NGOs and the controls exerted on both local and foreign NGOs.  We are taking careful note of the way in which these provisions are implemented. That is our task now. And we shall also be taking every available opportunity to make the Russian authorities aware of any concerns that arise with regard to that implementation. Our regular political dialogue with Russia and the next round of EURussia human rights consultations set for March are an excellent chance to do this.
4253163 author: Annette Brown:  . Mr President, first I should like to pay special tribute to my predecessor, Mr Laschet, from whom I inherited this report after his departure from the House.  I was initially sceptical when the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) concept was first floated in the  2003  communication on a wider Europe. The chief conceptual problem was how to coordinate a policy on countries that appear to have different and contradictory aims, such as Libya wanting to host the African Union at the time, and Ukraine wanting to join the European Union.  Political leadership is about turning concepts into reality and the ENP is now an established political reality accepted by the partner states. My report seeks to review its workings, bring additional recommendations from Parliament and clarify some of the misunderstandings surrounding it.  The ENP offers a privileged relationship between the EU and all its current nonMember State neighbours to the south and east. It excludes the current EU candidates for membership and the potential candidate countries of the western Balkans which have separate special arrangements. But what does the privilege bring? In short, two things: firstly, the greater sharing of democratic values, and secondly, aid and trade for promoting those values. The ENP is therefore twotracked: one lane promotes the values that underpin the European Union, namely, a commitment to common values regarding the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, the promotion of goodneighbourly relations and the principles of market economy and sustainable development; the other entails sanctions for failing them by restricting aid or trade privileges. The aim ultimately is to establish a circle of friends around the European Union in which the essential task of promoting and enhancing prosperity, stability and security is carried out in partnership and to mutual advantage. There will be increased financial assistance through a single dedicated European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), also applicable to Russia, which from  2007  onwards will replace the current TACIS and MEDA programmes. However, I am concerned that the Commission might decouple the ENP from the ENPI budget, which will entail a substantial erosion of Parliaments powers of oversight and scrutiny.  The Commission has already presented a strategy paper and country reports on a series of ENP countries, followed by action plans. A regular reviewing process will monitor the implementation of those, for which I seek more parliamentary involvement. Seven action plans have been adopted with Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, the Palestinian Authority, Ukraine and Moldova. Five more are in preparation with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia and Lebanon.  I strongly support improved access for ENP countries to the single market and, in some cases, the eventual conclusion of neighbourhood agreements and the establishment of fullyfledged free trade agreements with the European Union. I also support participation in the ESDPCFSP, including the various Council working groups, and membership, where appropriate, of the EU devolved agencies.  We also need better focus on drugs, weapons and peopletrafficking and enhanced exchanges of criminal intelligence between national agencies in the fight against international terrorism and organised crime, as well as renewed efforts for the peaceful resolution of outstanding territorial disputes, including the frozen conflicts. By coincidence, today in London, Armenia and Azerbaijan are meeting to resolve the NagornoKarabakh question.  Several ENP partner countries, such as Azerbaijan and Algeria, are rich in energy resources, as are the producers or transporters of oil and gas. Therefore, energy policy and EU energy security will be a key pillar of the ENP. The recent RussiaUkraine gas crisis illustrates how energy policy and foreign policy now interface.  Lastly, I do not consider the ENP a fixed, longterm alternative to full EU membership for those democratic European countries entitled to apply which have expressed a desire to do so, such as Ukraine and Moldova. The report goes some way towards recognising their European aspirations.  In contrast, as for other former Central Asian Soviet states, such as Kazakhstan  although currently not a part of the ENP  the EU should give serious consideration, in my view, when their PCA agreements eventually expire, to extending their right to participate in this ambitious project if they so wish.
1734822 author: Victor Green:  . Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for this very good report on the European neighbourhood policy, which will give me the opportunity to come back to the priorities for the next several months on this important issue.  As we have reiterated on several occasions since its inception in  2003 , the neighbourhood policy is an ambitious policy. It remains the number one issue  at least in my own portfolio  in EU external relations, because it is so important to promote prosperity, stability and security. The stakes for our neighbouring countries are very high. It is clearly in the interests of the European Union to have wellgoverned and democratic partners in our neighbourhood which can finally join in the positive dynamics of sustainable social and economic development. As you mentioned, it is also in our interests that conflicts in our vicinity are peacefully resolved and that issues like migration, border control, organised crime and terrorism are tackled in a more effective way through closer cooperation.  The year  2005  has been the first year of delivery for the ENP, with the beginning of the implementation of the first seven ENP action plans.  What do we want to do in the future? The Commission has been active on a broad front, including, for example, progress on market economy status; visa facilitation and energy issues for Ukraine; the border assistance mission on the MoldovanUkrainian border; creating new fora in which to discuss issues such as democracy, human rights and governance, for instance with our Mediterranean partners  I need only recall the Euromed Conference in Barcelona in November; the preparations to pursue our educational cooperation and in particular to extend twinning and technical assistance and information exchange programmes to TAIEX programmes to our partners; and our proposal for a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument  the ENPI  that will not be decoupled from the neighbourhood policy.  It must be said that for  2006  and  2007  it will be crucial for the further development of ENP to deliver, and there is a considerable onus on our partners regarding implementation, because we will continue to deliver on our own commitments, but how the partner countries react is very important. We will continue the implementation of the ENP action plans in close cooperation with our partners. At the end of  2006  we will issue a full progress report covering the implementation. We will also open certain programmes and agencies to ENP partners. For instance, we will start negotiations on agricultural and fishery products with our Mediterranean partners. We will work on visa facilitation issues with Ukraine and Moldova. For Ukraine the mandate is already there. We will also adopt the ENPI as soon as possible and hopefully provide it with adequate resources so that it can be fully operational from January  2007 . We are convinced that the ENPI will give us a better, more flexible and more focused instrument with which we can support reforms and crossborder cooperation.  Both we and our partners are facing a major challenge to turn the commitments contained in the action plans into real concrete action. Implementation is always the most important test and will depend very much on the partner countries political will and on our capacity, but also their capacity, to implement the commitments taken in the action plans. Let me assure you that we will do everything in our power to do so.  Let me also briefly say that the gas dispute of  1 January has shown how important the energy question has become. Let me also say that we must urgently draw the consequences of this gas dispute and the energy question for our external policy. I intend to give the highest priority to developing an effective foreign energy policy which will aim at the most effective guarantee possible of the security of the EU energy supply. We are not starting from scratch, as many instruments already exist, but they need further exploitation and an energy dialogue with Russia that has already covered much ground and provided us with a good basis to address bilateral aspects is there, but we have to make it really profound and we have to go on. We recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Ukraine on energy and, in addition, we will provide expertise to Ukraine and Moldova. Therefore, there is a multidimensional aspect and we shall address that through institutions such as G 8 , the International Energy Agency, the OSCE and others. We have the Energy Charter Treaty, which Russia has not yet joined, but we also have the SouthEast Europe Energy Community Treaty as instruments on which we will build. That means the neighbourhood policy will certainly also have to tackle these questions in the right format. But, again, as I said today in another context, we will also need coherence from the Member States.
8145120 author: Claire Green:  . Mr President, first of all I should like to greet my colleague Mr Verheugen, who is behind the neighbourhood policy. It is a happy coincidence that he is here today.  Secondly, I should like to repeat that I am very appreciative of the very broad support for the report by Mr Tannock and for the neighbourhood policy. It is indeed a very broad policy and it was therefore a broad discussion. This is a policy directed towards the EUs neighbours in the East, but also towards its neighbours in the Mediterranean. I will come to that in a moment.  On the European perspective, it is clear that the neighbourhood policy is one that is distinct from enlargement, but at the same time I should also say that the future is not set in stone. At this stage we have a policy totally distinct from enlargement. I could not be clearer in distinguishing and defining that policy.  There is also a regional perspective. This is very clear, for instance, in the Mediterranean process, Euromed. It is regional and the neighbourhood policy is the bilateral, complementary part of it, so the two work together. For instance, we have always very strongly supported the southsouth Agadir Cooperation between the countries.  Naturally, with regard to the East, that aspect can still be broadened. There is still a lot to be done. However, I can also tell you that during the energy crisis the regional dimension was also apparent. We have also very much enhanced, helped and encouraged Ukraine to help Moldova in the very times it has experienced recently.  In the energy field as a whole we are trying to work towards an integrated energy market. In the Mashreq there is an integrated gas market. There is also the cooperation between Palestine and Israel, which is at least aimed at more effective integration.  Let me answer a few specific questions. Many have been asked here. First, the inclusion of the southern Caucasus countries in the neighbourhood policy  something originally demanded by the European Parliament  is very welcome. The report suggests fully utilising the ENP to promote interstate confidence building. That is very important. It is crucial for the southern Caucasus countries to create stability. I agree with everyone who has said that we have to promote and reinforce the currentlyfrozen conflict solution in those countries. That is what we are trying to do.  The development of the ENP, as regards the southern Caucasus, remains a high priority. You all know that technical missions have been going to those countries in order to negotiate the action plans, notably because we also want to contribute to regional stability and reinforce EU support for resolving the conflicts there. We know that this will take time, but it is highly important that we are fully engaged in it.  Another question referred to Belarus. To date the Commission has been represented through its delegation in Kiev, which is accredited to Belarus. I have requested, as a first stage, that a regionalised delegation mission be established in Belarus, headed by a charg daffaires under the head of mission of Kiev. I am still awaiting a positive reply from the Belarusian authorities. However, my understanding is that if we have a delegation there then we can work much more closely with the government in Minsk and try to reinforce our own criteria.  Many of you will know that our assistance to Belarus is characterised by a twotrack approach. There is also a strategy for more democratisation and human rights to meet the needs of the population at large, and a decentralised programme. That means new funding for support to democratisation, which is available under the EIDHR and direct work, for instance as regards the radio station and the possibility of directly influencing information through our independent broadcasting to Belarus. That is already under way. But we are also working for higher education and for training, if you bear in mind the closure of the university in Minsk and our work in Vilnius.  The whole question of the Transnistrian conflict has been mentioned. In line with the commitment in the action plan, we have taken a much higher profile in supporting the mediation process. Since October  2005  we have tried to work, together with the US, as observers. We now have a special representative for Moldova, Ambassador Jacobovits de Szeged, who is working for a solution to the Transnistrian conflict. In this connection we set up the MoldovanEU border assistance mission on  1 December. It is designed to assist Moldova and Ukraine in ensuring transparent management of their common border, thus stepping up cooperation on border issues and trying to combat corruption and the misleading of customs.  I disagree with those who say that the Barcelona Summit was a failure. I really regret the media reports about Barcelona. I was there from the very beginning until the very end. I can tell you that Barcelona was excellent in its substance. There is a report on migration. Please read it. There is a common position on combating terrorism. There is the substance that the Commission, in our communication, brought forward in April. One should look at why various heads of state did not attend. For instance, it may have been somewhat difficult for the King of Morocco to go to Spain because of the differences they still have. King Abdullah II of Jordan had to change his government. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria was in a hospital in Paris and still is, as far as I know. President Mubarak had just had elections in Egypt and was not in the best of conditions to go to Barcelona. However, many prime ministers attended and it is they who have to implement policy.  Twinning and TAIEX, the two excellent instruments that have helped the enlargement countries a great deal, are also there for the neighbourhood countries, and we will use them.  There were many other questions, but I cannot go into more detail now owing to time constraints. However, if those questions are raised again in the Committee on Foreign Affairs then I would be pleased to answer them.
4671597 author: Claire Brown:  . Mr President, it is a great honour to address you today on the Middle East peace process. It is particularly timely, since I have just returned from a visit to Gaza, the West Bank and Israel.  I had three objectives for this trip: first, to lend support to democracybuilding in the runup to the Palestinian elections. There is an important Election Observation Mission there with your colleague, MrsDeKeyser; secondly, to underline the importance of European Union financial support to the Palestinian people, and, thirdly, to thus raise the visibility of a number of EU projects, notably in Gaza.  I spent a whole day in Gaza. The security situation there is very complicated, it was not easy to go in but in the end it was a good day and I hope that the images brought to the Palestinian people show how much we, the European Union, are standing by them.  It is a critical moment in the Middle East. In both Israel and the Palestinian territories, there have been tremendous changes in the political landscape. I hope that these elections will bring about two leaderships that are ready and able to inject new vigour into this peace process.  I made it clear to both Israelis and Palestinians that the Commission will continue to offer its support to all those who seek peace by peaceful means. That means in particular that whatever the composition of the new Palestinian Government, there must be full respect for the principles enshrined in the Interim Association Agreement and in the Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan that we agreed with the Palestinian Authority. These principles include respect for human rights and the rule of law, and thus a clear commitment to the roadmap.  The Palestinian Authority has given the international community assurances that the elections will take place free from violence and intimidation and according to international standards; we can only hope that this will come true. President Abbas has also made it clear that acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government. I think it was important that he gave such a clear message.  Acting Prime Minister Olmert, whom I also saw, assured me that Israel would facilitate the holding of these elections. His government took a difficult decision, in the context of an Israeli preelection campaign, to allow voting in East Jerusalem. I welcomed that decision and I hope that this constructive spirit will help resolve any other remaining logistical and practical aspects of the elections. Within the security constraints, it will be very important that Israel does all it can to allow free movement for voters and candidates in the Palestinian territories up to and including polling day.  The European Union is supporting the Palestinian elections with the biggest Election Observation Mission   240  observers, including  50  of your colleagues. I visited the Observation Team led by Mrs de Keyser, and was most impressed by her dedication and professionalism and that of her team. I was also impressed to meet the Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Dr Hanna Nasir. Thanks to the sustained support of the European Union  with which the Commission has been involved since  2003   the CEC has established itself as one of the most credible and respected institutions in the Palestinian territories. During my visit, I announced another EUR 1 . 4 million to help with voter registration and polling activities, which brings our support for the election process to EUR 18 . 5 million, which is a large amount of money to try to make these elections free and fair.  One of the purposes of my visit to Gaza was to raise the profile of the important work we are doing, providing urgent assistance to make Palestinians ordinary lives more bearable. We are improving the health system, building schools and repairing roads, making improvements as regards solid waste, sewage waste and electricity grids. Much of that will be to the benefit of the Palestinian people and I hope they understand that it comes from the European Union.  I inaugurated some public works programmes and also announced the launch of four new energy and environment infrastructure projects in Gaza worth EUR 20 million. We are working with all possible speed, but the security situation is not making our work any easier.  Yet revitalising Gazas economy is essential. What I saw only strengthened my conviction on that, and I will continue to press this point in the Quartet  there will be a Quartet meeting on  30 January in London, after the Afghanistan conference  and with Israel. We must continue to improve free movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. So, I have relaunched the procurement process for a EUR 25  million cargo terminal at the airport. We visited the airport, and we know how important it is to open it up, not only to the region, but also to the world, to help facilitate Palestinian trade once it has been reopened. We will only be able to go ahead with the project once there is an agreement between both sides. We therefore strongly support Jim Wolfensohn with the whole scope of the project that he has outlined since the opening of the Rafah crossing.  We will not be able to step up travel in and out of Gaza without properly managed borders. I visited the Rafah border crossing and I must say that General Pistolesi and his team at the EU Border Assistance Mission are doing an excellent job. I was moved to see that Europeans are helping ordinary Palestinians to move across the border with Egypt for the first time in many years; this maintains the great dignity of the Palestinian people. They are very happy. I spoke to two women who expressed the hope that things might slowly get better. Therefore, we will provide a further EUR 3 million package of support for the Rafah border crossing. We are carrying out customs duties there, so it will provide scanning equipment as well as training for the Palestinians.  I made it clear to both my Israeli and Palestinian counterparts and interlocutors that the European Union is contributing substantially to creating the conditions for a twoState solution. Like everyone involved, we face major challenges, but we are in it for the long haul. We want to make a long term commitment. I clearly reiterated that. We have been a consistent and reliable partner for both sides. But to make progress, both sides must move.  Israel should take steps to implement the agreement brokered in November by the Quartet Special Envoy Jim Wolfensohn on improving movement and access  the port, the airport, the link between Gaza and the West Bank and movement within the West Bank. And the Palestinian Authority must take charge of law and order and public finances. It must take serious steps to relaunch its reform programme and respect its commitments under the Interim Association Agreement and the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.  At this critical juncture, our message is very clear: there is a need for negotiations; all action threatening a twoState solution must cease; and imposing law and order and fighting terrorism are important.
10364992 author: James MacLeod:  . Mr President, may I thank the honourable Members for a very broad and interesting debate. The Middle East is a subject on which one could speak for hours, but I shall take up the most important points.  Firstly, Mr McMillanScott raised the issue of funding a chamber for the Palestinian Council. We will have to await the outcome of the elections and see what government will be formed  I shall come back to the question of Hamas shortly. Then we will have to consult the Palestinians themselves to find out their demands and to see where we can support them. It will depend on that common vision whether we can support such a chamber. I do not rule it out completely, but it is really up to the Palestinians to ask for that.  Secondly, you also asked how we could help the democratisation process. I think our Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan would be the best basis for such further democratisation, for the rule of law, which is one of the major issues and one on which we insist very strongly.  For a year now we have had much better relations with the Israelis; on the one hand because Prime Minister Sharon kept his word on the withdrawal from Gaza  which was a step forward  and, on the other hand, because of the action plan, in which the Israelis are highly interested. I had a lengthy talk with Prime Minister Olmert on that subject. They are very interested in doing something.  On your third question, I would say that we are very preoccupied about the sentence on Mr Ayman Nour, the leader of the main opposition party in Egypt. The Commission was very supportive of a Troika statement issued by the European Union immediately after the sentence. We will follow up the case in the Council meeting of Foreign Ministers on  30 January and then in our current negotiations on the action plan with Egypt  negotiations which, it must be said, are not easy.  To return to Hamas, I know one of the crucial questions is what the government will look like after the elections. The polls show a possible share of the vote of between  30  and  40  for Hamas. Accordingly, I have very clearly stated that we will work with any government that will seek peace by peaceful means and will also respect the principles incorporated in our two major agreements. One is the interim association agreement. As I have already said, there is democracy, the rule of law, the basic principles that we all hold up. Secondly there is the action plan, in which there is a clear commitment to the roadmap.  President Abbas himself made it very clear that the acceptance of the Oslo Accords and the roadmap forms the basis for participation in the future government. I know that the Israeli Government is very clear and adamant about certain things it demands of a future Palestinian Government. We will of course work with both parties on these issues, because we know how sensitive and crucial they are in order to make progress on those issues on which we all agree: the free movement of people and goods for the Palestinians, where I have announced the possibility of going forward with the airport; where we are starting the procurement procedures in order to make it possible to get more access for people and goods. At the same time, it is also important to see how a government can be formed in Israel.  I agree with my Cypriot colleague, Mr Kasoulides, that an interesting situation is also arising on the Israeli side. With Prime Minister Sharon incapacitated at the moment, acting Prime Minister Olmet has taken over in a pragmatic, proEuropean way  that is clearly what he stated  but in a way in which he can hold up the security question, which is the overriding question for every Prime Minister in Israel. Hopefully, things will go in the right direction. I do not want to interfere in any of these processes; we are still two months ahead of the Israeli elections. The important thing is that there is a leadership in the future that is able, capable and willing to go on with that.  I agree with those who say that, as very clearly stated in the Quartet, we also have to speak out very clearly on the question of settlements, on the separation barrier. The Councils report  it was a Council decision, by the way  has not been publicised, but it has already been covered in the press, so everybody knows what it contains.  Finally, the important thing for us will be to work very closely with both sides because, as many others have said, the PalestineIsraeli conflict greatly influences the stability of the whole region. The situation in Iraq and the upcoming difficult situation with Iran do not help to improve the stability of the region.
2491336 author: Mary Cameron:  . Let the people decide  The treaties can be amended only by unanimity. The proposed Constitution has been rejected by  55   of the voters in France and  62   in the Netherlands. Their verdict must be respected. Therefore the proposed Constitution IS dead according to the rules adopted unanimously among the Member States of the EU.  The next meeting in the European Council must accordingly declare the draft text dead; reflect on the No votes; reread the questions from the Laeken declaration and go back to first principles.  The is to decide whether treaties require popular approval. We believe that treaties have to be adopted by referendum in all member States where it is legally possible. The referendums should if possible be held on the same date.  Supporters and opponents of the constitution should be asked to produce a joint text for debate about our possible futures. It can include joint amendments on transparency and democratic procedures where the working group may agree. It will certainly include different proposals for catalogues of competences where members will disagree.  After a year of debate, two alternatives should be placed before the national electorates: On the one hand a renewed constitution; on the other a Cooperation Agreement among European democracies.  The new directly elected Convention must work in public in working groups and plenary meetings for a year. Each chapter of the existing treaties will have to have a special working group to allow drastic simplification of the existing complicated texts.  Finally, the plenary of the Convention may adopt two different proposals, a draft Constitution and a draft Cooperation agreement and then ask the voters what they prefer.  When we have the peoples verdict the Member States can then meet in a formal intergovernmental conference and take the necessary decisions to be adopted formally according to the demands in the national constitutions. If one or two Member States reject the drafts, a unanimous solution will have to be found in respect of the agreed playing rules for treaty changes.  We, the minority in the European Parliaments Constitutional committee and the SOS Democracy inter group in the European Parliament, hope and believe that the peoples of most states will see no need for a constitution beyond their own national constitutions. We expect supporters of the constitution to show the same respect for democracy.  Our alternative may be based on seven broad proposals  The constitution is dead. Instead of a complicated constitution and the Nice Treaty with priority over national constitutions, we want a cooperation agreement with no more than  50  articles. Countries that dont wish to join the cooperation agreement can choose a free trade agreement instead.  The European Council should establish a working group with equal numbers of supporters and opponents of the Constitution in order to present a proposal of rules which is flexible enough to let them unite instead of divide Europe, as we have seen the Constitution do.  Openness and full access to documents will be the main rule. Any exceptions shall be approved with  75   support. The Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the EUParliament shall be able to control all expenditures.  Decision makers shall be directly accountable through the ballot box to those who must abide by their decisions in each country.  Laws should be adopted with unanimity or by a  75   majority among member states and simple majority in the EUParliament. There should be the opportunity for veto, when a national Parliament votes against a proposal for EUlaw and requests the prime minister to bring up the case at the next summit.  The subsidiarity principle should be controlled by the national parliaments. The existing  100 , 000  pages of legislation must be revised critically, and the main part must be eliminated or sent back to the member states.  Laws should be approved as a common set of minimum standards which gives the member states more flexibility and possibility to have a higher level of protection of security, health, environment, working conditions, social conditions and consumer protection. We should prefer mutual recognition to total harmonisation.  Foreign and security policy, the euro cooperation and legal cooperation should not be an obligatory part of the cooperation but can be transferred to an enhanced cooperation if desired by the individual countries. Defence should be completely separated from the Union.
6891964 author: James Whittacker:  Mr President, a common foreign and security policy that promotes Europes values in the world and brings peace and security to our neighbours is what Liberals and Democrats strive for. But it is what Europes leaders are manifestly failing to provide.  Acting together, our Union could have used its leverage to promote democracy and stability. Instead, its policies have given tacit support to tyrannies like Tunisia, Egypt and Syria. We never demanded that diplomacy depend on releasing democrats like Egypts Ayman Nour; or, in Asia, on the right to a free return to his country for opposition leader Sam Rainsy, now in exile while we fund the dictatorship of Hun Sen.  Mrs FerreroWaldner, Mr Solana, why are you surprised at the Palestinian poll? The European Union has peddled promises of democracy, peace and human rights in Palestine while our development aid has fed AlFatah, whose members now burn images of one of our prime ministers and peace negotiations have got nowhere. Far from being a key player, Mr Solana, the consequences of Europes failure are plain for all to see.  Israel, undeterred, builds a wall around East Jerusalem in violation of its roadmap obligations and international law. The Palestinians, tired of slow progress and shameful social services, turn to Hamas at the ballot box. And now the prognosis is worse than ever. After demanding democracy, some EU leaders talk of shunning one of the only democratically elected governments in the Arab world! Of course, Hamas must renounce violence and commit to a twostate solution. But so must Israel. As Leila Shahid, the General Delegate for the Palestinian Authority said today: It takes two to tango.  The Commissioner has spoken of policies based on human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles, but where is the emphasis on those fine things when pragmatism devoid of principles is so often the order of the day?  A global drive for peaceful conflict resolution would be a major counterweight to the heavyhanded US approach; it would assure Europes security, prosperity and global repute; and it would also give us far greater leverage over microstates like the Maldives or the Seychelles, whose governments abuse human rights despite being almost totally dependent on our aid and trade. That is why Liberals and Democrats believe that the time has come for an accountable, properly funded and valuesdriven European foreign policy. According to Eurobarometer, it is a desire shared by  70  of our citizens.  Mr Solana, Liberals and Democrats object to Parliaments views being ignored or disregarded on matters of global importance. We want to see less of you on television and more of you here in this Chamber. And we are tired of Council secrecy and its disregard for Parliaments right to prior consultation on policy priorities. Those rights are enshrined in Article 21  of the Treaty and in the  1999  Interinstitutional Agreement.  We are facing many grave challenges: to democratise our Near Neighbourhood, especially former Soviet republics currently at the mercy of Russias energy politics; to ensure that the elections in Belarus are free and fair; and to ensure that the referendums in Kosovo and Montenegro do not end in violence.  The role of foreign policy must not end there. I understand that selling arms to China is back on the Councils agenda, yet China has still not recanted the Tiananmen Square killings, nor released, after  16 years, all those jailed. So we demand an assurance from you, Mr Winkler, that the Austrian Presidency will not lift the Unions arms embargo.  Most pressing is the question of Iran. The IAEA board of governors meets tomorrow to decide whether to report Iran to the Security Council. Stopping Iran building nuclear weapons must be our aim. That is why Europe must commit to respect the IAEAs findings due in March. But making progress towards the disarmament of the current nuclear powers, in line with the commitments we have made, is the strongest and most convincing message we could possibly send. A Europe which learns to use its muscle as a force for good is truly a force to be reckoned with.
513834 author: Christoph Brown:  . Mr President, as we mentioned in the previous debate, we are indeed faced with a new reality. On Monday, the EU Foreign Ministers and the Quartet met to discuss our reaction to the entry of Hamas into the Palestinian national political arena, and the implications for our assistance to the Palestinian Authority.  Let me bear three elements in mind. The first are our principles, which should be absolutely clear. We supported these elections by providing financial support of  18 . 5 million EUR. In addition, we have heard about  240 election observers under Mrs De Keysers great leadership. We also demonstrated our commitment to building democratic institutions. I think this is clearly a principled position. Should we now abandon this position today because we do not like the result of the elections? I think that would also clearly be a mistake. On the contrary, we should call for all to respect the outcome of a democratic election. When I visited Gaza, I clearly said that we were ready to work with a government that seeks peace by peaceful means. As the Quartet reiterated, that means cooperation, a clear commitment to nonviolence, a recognition of Israel and the acceptance of previous commitments including the roadmap and the Oslo agreement.  Secondly, the responsibilities: the ball is now in the camp of the Palestinian leaders. It is their responsibility to behave like partners and to meet the criteria set by the international community. It is not yet clear how Hamas, under its change and reform platform, will exercise the responsibilities that a new Palestinian government will need to assume. This will take time to become apparent. In both these discussions, I have advocated a clear message from the international community as to what we expect. I have also said that the European Commission stands ready to work with any government that is really seeking peace by peaceful means.  However, we are mindful of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, which are indeed considerable. We are also mindful of the legitimate Palestinian aspirations for statehood. We must bear in mind that donor funding is crucial in alleviating the plight of ordinary Palestinians and in preventing the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism. But we are also mindful of our own commitment to a twostate solution and to Israels security needs.  Therefore, first and foremost, we expect future members of a Palestinian government to commit to these three principles. This applies to the EUPalestinian Interim Association Agreement. This clearly states that freedom of democracy, the rule of law and human rights have to be respected. In addition, the Neighbourhood Action Plan also clearly provides that the roadmap has to be the path to peace.  While the conduct of Hamas, as an organisation, will continue to be the subject of close scrutiny, the new Palestinian government must in the first instance be judged on its actions, including the provision of security and stability.  The stabilisation of public finances is a major and immediate challenge. I am ready to be constructive in reacting to the fiscal problems of the Palestinian Authority  especially now for the interim government and for the caretaker government  by easing their liquidity problems. But others, too, must play their role. This includes Israel, which has been called upon to continue to transfer customs revenues to the Palestinian Authority. I, as well as other Quartet members, will also personally speak to the Israelis about this issue.  The role of the Palestinians themselves, will also be crucial. The World Bank is sending a mission to see what it can do and how the Palestinian Authority could meet the benchmarks, maybe retrenching the budget. They have to find a possibility of lifting the suspension on World Bank Trust Fund payments. USD  35 million are still lying there. They have not been disbursed because they could not be disbursed. I hope I can count on the support of Parliament to find a shortterm solution. However, it will also be important for the new government to get essential reforms back on track. This should be done in the same spirit as when we worked with the Palestinian Authority in the past.  In the meantime, the Commission intends to continue those aid programmes which provide for the basic needs of the Palestinians, including the infrastructure facility, food aid and humanitarian and refugee assistance.  In closing let me say that the peace process is  as we all know  at a very critical juncture. The year  2005  was dominated by unilateral Israeli actions and Palestinian institutional paralysis. The international community must now provide a tangible perspective of progress, using our efforts on both sides, with the Israelis and with the Palestinian Authority. In this context, I agree, we have to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas and his authority in order to provide stability and demonstrate that the negotiations will bring positive results. It is for this reason that I would like to underline the importance of avoiding all unilateral actions which threaten to prejudice final status negotiations, including terrorist attacks, settlement expansions and the routing of the separation barrier.  Now, therefore, we have to work together very closely: the days and months ahead will be absolutely crucial in determining stability in the Middle East, as well as our own stability.
198420 author: James McNabb:  . Mr President, the issue of mens violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society. It is everywhere and it affects the whole of society directly and indirectly. I am grateful for what I perceive to be a growing understanding of the scope of this problem. I want to thank my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Womens Rights and Equal Opportunities for the valuable help and support I received during this work. I am also pleased that Commissioner Franco Frattini has shown a strong and honest commitment. We now have a serious opportunity to recognise all women who have experienced violence but not justice.  The cornerstone of my report is that we need correct figures. At EU level there are no reliable studies. However, three national prevalence studies in Finland in  1999 , Sweden in  2001  and Germany in  2004 , indicate that previous assessments have vastly underestimated the extent of the problem. Using the United Nations definition of violence against women, these studies show that  40  to  50  of women in these three countries have, at some point in their lives, been subjected to violence by a man. I should like to emphasise that: between  40  and  50  of all women between the age of  16  and  67 . The corresponding figure for the whole of the EU would be incredibly high, at between  80  and  100  million women.  Obviously effective measures must be based on correct facts and figures and the need for similar studies in other Member States is urgent. The magnitude of the problem in itself indicates that all Member States are repeatedly violating the basic rules of civil liberties and the rule of law on a scale that we have yet to understand. You may think this an exaggeration. It is not.  I would like to invoke a classic liberal. More than  300  years ago, the British philosopher, John Locke, introduced a fundamental idea: a government should be regarded as a tool for the defence of fundamental rights, the most fundamental civil right being the right to life and physical safety. This is the moral, normative basis for the state and its reason for being. Citizens agree to obey the laws, but this presupposes that the state fulfils its basic commitment to protect the lives, freedom and property of its citizens. Any state which fails in this task has broken the contract. When it comes to violence against women, the failure is measurable in all Member States of the Union. All violence is a challenge to our civilisation and to the rule of law. But mens violence against women is a specific challenge to the contract of which all common policy is an expression.  There is a systematic difference in the way crimes of violence are treated, depending on the gender of the victim. Violence against men typically happens in public, perpetrated by another man, often a stranger. Violence against women typically happens in private, perpetrated by a man known to the woman, very often a man with whom the woman has or has had a relationship. The most crucial difference, politically, is that private violence against women is not prosecuted as seriously as public violence against men. The issue of mens violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, there is also a history.  Violence in the street from a stranger, primarily affecting men, has been a criminal offence in Europe for centuries, but it is quite recent that violence occurring in the home was made a criminal offence. Well into the latter part of the  20 th century, Europe had many laws which excused domestic violence by men against women. This legacy lives on in our Union. We can see it in case law, attitudes and perceptions about the less serious nature of private violence.  The issue of mens violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society. Mens violence against women has also been a way of keeping men, in general, in power.  When the UN General Assembly in  1993  adopted the declaration on the elimination of violence against women, it was the first time a UN document had placed mens violence against women in a genderpower perspective. It explicitly links violence to the superior position of men. What we need to do now is to act. First get the figures right and then proceed to the proper solutions. The issue of mens violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, it affects us all. I demand zero tolerance of mens violence against women.
4599338 author: Jennifer Merx:  . Mr President, the roadmap for State aid reform from the Commission is a good and an important document. I hope that this report will contribute to the improvement of the State aid policy. Therefore, I should like to thank colleagues and shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this improvement by the amendments and discussions we have had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I hope there will be, as there was in the committee, broad support for this new policy, which I hope will make an impact on the future guidelines on State aid policy that the Commission will be responsible for.  MrPresident, Europe needs a competitive economy. As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, 240 observers, including 50 of your colleagues. I visited the Observation Team led by Mrs de Keyser, and was most impressed by her dedication and professionalism and that of her team. I was also impressed to meet the Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Dr Hanna Nasir. Thanks to the sustained support of the European Union with which the Commission has been involved since 2003 the CEC has established itself as one of the most credible and respected institutions in the Palestinian territories. During my visit, I announced another EUR 1 . 4 million to help with voter registration and polling activities, which brings our support for the election process to EUR 18 . 5 million, which is a large amount of money to try to make these elections free and fair. One of the purposes of my visit to Gaza was to raise the profile of the important work we are doing, providing urgent assistance to make Palestinians ordinary lives more bearable. We are improving the health system, building schools and repairing roads, making improvements as regards solid waste, sewage waste and electricity grids. Much of that will be to the benefit of the Palestinian people and I hope they understand that it comes from the European Union. I inaugurated some public works programmes and also announced the launch of four new energy and environment infrastructure projects in Gaza worth EUR 20 million. We are working with all possible speed, but the security situation is not making our work any easier. Yet revitalising Gazas economy is essential. What I saw only strengthened my conviction on that, and I will continue to press this point in the Quartet there will be a Quartet meeting on 30 January in London, after the Afghanistan conference and with Israel. We must continue to improve free movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza. So, I have relaunched the procurement process for a EUR 25 new jobs, new products and new markets. It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate. Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.  If we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old. This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses. A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind. However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome.  In European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned. In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of. The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be. As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs. We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors. Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window. We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.  An overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commissions document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition. A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid. What is required is that State aid be predictable. It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations. The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable. The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another. That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation. The same applies to companies in the public interest. We must not have State aid that funds that type of activity excessively, but must give new companies opportunities to develop.  The same may be said of regional or environmental aid. It must be directed across the board and so made open and accessible to all. If we ensure that this happens and follow up the demands for increased scrutiny and transparency, better rendering of accounts and more stringent auditing, we shall lay the basis for a State aid policy that entails less State aid, and such State aid as there is will no longer distort competition. There will, however, be increased resources for innovation, a cleaner environment and thriving regions.
1083935 author: Michael Bauer:  . Mr President, I count my blessings tonight. I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue. I congratulate the rapporteur. The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.  I should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma. That was made clear on your side. It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.  Mrs int Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily noneconomic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.  On the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.  A couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.  We will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as publicprivate partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.  Turning to SMEs, when we look at the  25  Member States,  92  of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and mediumsized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and mediumsized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.  It has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.  Mr WortmannKool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category. So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.  On the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental. I am sure that is not the question that is being asked. We have to look at all the policies of the Union. However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.  On public services, services of general economic interest, the Commissions decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation. The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments. As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary. I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.  Finally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in.
1364117 author: Helen Whittacker:  . Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the owninitiative report of the European Parliament on the effects of globalisation on the internal market and thanks everyone involved, in particular the rapporteurs MrsHerczog and Mr Markov, as well as the members of the IMCO and INTA Committees, for the good work undertaken in putting this report together. I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.  It was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say. The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way. The report is a timely contribution to an important debate. Europe needs to find appropriate responses to todays key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.  As international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack. Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation. There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular. There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance. However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom. I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere  foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.  Protectionism is not the answer. It never was historically  it only ever led to great tensions between nations  and it is not now. Comparing the degree of openness of economic systems with economic growth and development will show that openness pays. It always has done and it always will. For people first. With jobs. With thriving businesses. By releasing human energies, not capping or constraining them.  I am very glad that in its report the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as well as the Committee on International Trade, which has given an opinion, takes a constructive and balanced approach towards globalisation. As the report says, we can make globalisation a success if we provide the right conditions, and if we focus on our strengths. And we do not need to be modest about this. Europe has a lot to offer.  We must make sure that Europe and the internal market remain an attractive place for consumers and businesses; an attractive place to invest, particularly for research and innovation activities in highvalue products 1999 , Sweden in 2001 and Germany in 2004 , indicate that previous assessments have vastly underestimated the extent of the problem. Using the United Nations definition of violence against women, these studies show that 40 to 50 of women in these three countries have, at some point in their lives, been subjected to violence by a man. I should like to emphasise that: between 40 and 50 of all women between the age of 16 and 67 . The corresponding figure for the whole of the EU would be incredibly high, at between 80 and 100 million women. Obviously effective measures must be based on correct facts and figures and the need for similar studies in other Member States is urgent. The magnitude of the problem in itself indicates that all Member States are repeatedly violating the basic rules of civil liberties and the rule of law on a scale that we have yet to understand. You may think this an exaggeration. It is not. I would like to invoke a classic liberal. More than 300 and services, where our businesses excel. This requires a strong, knowledgebased and properly regulated internal market, using the experience we have gained and the lessons we have learned. This is Europes best response to its domestic problems of low economic growth and high unemployment, but also to the challenge of globalisation.  Priorities in this context are: an effective implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs; the completion of the internal market, including for services, telecoms, energy, and financial services; ensuring simple and effective regulation, which frees businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape; and making better use of the existing internal market framework, which includes better administrative cooperation across borders. Most of the relevant work is already under way, and it is important that all players, at the EU level and at Member State level, do everything to make it happen.  As the report quite rightly stresses, globalisation also has a strong external dimension for internal market policymaking. We need to be much more outwardlooking than in the past and to be aware of the external aspects of our internal economic policies, such as our internal market rules. Nothing is simply domestic any more. We need more international regulatory convergence and equivalence of rules. This is particularly important in the area of financial markets, which are leading the way in globalisation. Furthermore, Europe must use its scale to help deliver ambitious and balanced solutions to problems of market access or regulatory issues. A successful conclusion of the Doha Round, including on services, is a key element in this respect. Everyone will benefit!  Last but not least, we need a new partnership of the EU and Member States. Neither can deliver on their own to ensure that Europe remains the attractive place that it still is. I am confident that the report of the European Parliament will contribute significantly to this important wider discussion on Europe in the globalised world.
1276565 author: Sarah White:  . Mr President, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the confiscation of cars in Greece. I have read, and now I have heard, Mr Cashmans report with great interest, and I share all the concerns expressed in it. The issues highlighted in the report are of great importance not only for this specific case but also as regards their impact on the Commission initiatives in the field of car taxation and the fundamental rights of citizens.  Let me say a few words on the case in question. In addition to the numerous petitions received by Parliament, the Commission has received a great number of complaints over recent years about an administrative practice which leads to the confiscation of cars. I do not intend to go deeply into technical details, but, as you know, Community law allows a citizen resident in one Member State  I emphasise resident and not national  to use his or her car for personal reasons in another Member State without being obliged to register his or her car in that other Member State, provided certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the use in the other Member State does not exceed six months in one year.  The application of this directive has been quite problematic in Greece. It has led to an administrative practice which, unfortunately, has disregarded the fact that, in many cases, the normal residence of Greek citizens is in a state other than Greece. This practice penalises mostly Greek nationals who do not live and work in Greece on a permanent basis. The outcome has been, as you can see from the report, the imposition of very high fines resulting in the confiscation of the vehicles concerned, followed sometimes by their sale at auction, even before a national judge could come to a decision on the case. The Commission has also been informed in the past that, in some cases, this has led to prison sentences. For these reasons, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure and brought the case before the European Court of Justice.  Let me stress that it is neither the intention nor to the benefit of the Commission to single out one Member State instead of another, since in one way or another every Member State faces its own difficulties in the path towards the realisation of a real internal market, where fundamental freedoms and the respect of Community law should be guaranteed.  To a large extent, car taxation is not yet harmonised at Community level. Nevertheless, the freedom that Member States enjoy has to be exercised within the framework laid down by the directives applicable in this field and within the general principles of Community law, which represent the fundamentals of the construction of the European Union.  When an individual incurs significant adverse economic consequences if he or she seeks to make use of his of her car for a certain period of time in another Member State, especially when this is allowed by Community law, this represents a risk to the free movement of citizens within the Union.  It is also true that Member States are free to determine the fines that they feel are adequate for an infringement of their laws, assuming that an infringement really occurs. However, they should respect the principle of proportionality. A practice which also disregards the evidence that residence is maintained in a Member State or which imposes high fines without taking into account the good faith of the offender should also be rectified.  The Commission, at this stage, has taken all the necessary steps allowed by the Treaty in order to tackle this situation. However, the Commission welcomes an initiative like this, which allows a further reflection on the impact that vehicle taxation has on the life of EU citizens.  To conclude, let me say that, looking at the broader perspective, the Commission is not only proceeding with its infringement policy but is also taking a proactive approach in the field of legislative proposals. In July  2005 , the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation, which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market. One of the objectives of the proposal is the abolition of the registration tax in order to incorporate it into the annual circulation tax over a period of five to ten years. The proposal is currently being discussed in various parliamentary committees and in the Council, and I call for your support on this matter.  I thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate.
6455556 author: Michael Green:  . Mr President, I have listened to the debate attentively and I wish to comment on a few aspects.  It is true that since the beginning of the infringement procedure, the situation has improved in the Member State concerned. I would like to recall that until a few years ago the fines imposed were those applying to infringement of the customs legislation and also that smuggling was one of the crimes envisaged by the national law. This, fortunately, is no longer the case and the Commission wants to express its satisfaction at the progress made. However, further steps still have to be taken to align national practice with Community law.  Let me clarify one important point: the high registration taxes on vehicles that are applied in some Member States on the occasion of a permanent transfer of residence are a completely different issue 2 , 5 , 7 , 19 and 23 . Regarding the safetynet provision proposal 8 the discussion in the Council has not produced a clear mandate for introducing a general safety clause in all COMs or for trying to finance this insurance out of the modulated money. However, I am ready to examine the introduction of targeted risk and crisis management provisions in other COMs and, as mentioned by Mr Gklavakis, in the fruit and vegetable sector, which we will also discuss here in Parliament at the end of this year. I completely agree with your rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that basic coverage against income reduction is not a solution. It is quite clear that, if or when we face structural problems, they must be solved through policy changes. That is obvious and I am very happy about Mr Graefe zu Baringdorfs clear support for it. As a safetynet for income, I consider the CAP reforms decoupled direct payment to the farmer to be essential. I am positive about the content of proposals 18 , 24 and 26 . I also take this opportunity to draw your attention to the review of the state aid guidelines adopted by the Commission on 8 from the one dealt with in Mr Cashmans report.  On the one hand, the determination of the amount of registration tax due when a person registers a car in one state depends on the tax policy of the Member State concerned. European law  particularly the prohibition of discrimination against imported goods in favour of domestic goods  may have a bearing with respect to how the tax is calculated, especially with respect to the value attributed to secondhand cars. However, Community law does not prevent a Member State from applying a high registration tax on vehicles.  On the other hand, Mr Cashmans report deals with the application of an existing directive, which allows a temporary use of a vehicle in another Member State without the obligation to reregister it. I would add that this is an issue of concrete application of Community law by national authorities. The report concerns, inter alia, the interpretation of the concept of normal residence by the national authorities, which runs counter to the principles enshrined in the directive itself.  In fact, the directive is able to function properly only if a person who resides in one Member State is allowed to use his vehicle in the territory of a Member State other than that where the normal residence is located. If evidence of residence in the first state is not accepted or is rendered difficult by the second state, the directive has no chance of being applied correctly. I would also remind you that the issue concerns the freedom to provide and receive services in another Member State. This is the core point of the case being discussed now.  Before concluding, I wish to react to some of the issues and questions raised by some of the participants in the debate. It is true that other Member States are also infringing Community law, but these infringements are in connection with other aspects of car taxation, such as discrimination in levying registration tax, and there has been no confiscation of cars, which also points to the lack of proportionality.  Another issue raised during the debate was whether it was legal or legitimate that actions are being taken when the European Court of Justice is still discussing the case. We sought the opinion of Parliaments Legal Service. It had no objections, and the Commission is certainly not in a position to review the view of Parliaments Legal Service.  To conclude, I want to say that in this case, bearing in mind that the Commission is still receiving complaints on this issue, the Commission has taken all the action possible. A case is pending before the European Court of Justice. Of course this pending case does not in any way prevent a Member State that wishes to comply with Community Law from changing its legislation in the meantime before the decision is issued. We have indeed heard that Greece has drafted or is drawing up legislation, but as we have not received any official signal from the Greek authorities, we cannot give our opinion on it.  The Commission very much welcomes the encouraging signals that it has received from the Greek authorities during the debates in Parliament and would also welcome this being consolidated by the adoption of the new law.  Thank you very much for your attention.
10216614 author: Helen White:  . Mr President, I welcome this report on the human rights and democracy clause in European Union agreements prepared by the honourable Members of this House, and especially by Mr Agnoletto, and the resolution before Parliament today.  Human rights clauses have been inserted systematically into external agreements since  1995  and, ten years on, it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved. All EU institutions need to work together to this end, and I emphasise my commitment to an ongoing, but also very practical, dialogue with the Council and Parliament, for which this report provides a good basis.  I shall begin by underlining how much has already been achieved: it must be said that the glass is more than half full. After often difficult discussions and very difficult negotiations, the Commission has secured the inclusion of a human rights and democracy clause in, as you said, more than  50  agreements, covering over  120  countries. A notable example is, indeed, that of Articles  9  and  96  of the Cotonou Agreement. In the field of trade policy, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as GSP, provides additional benefits for countries that implement, , certain international standards in human and social rights; so it is a positive incentive.  The impact of human rights clauses is already evident, and many of our human rights activities are supported by their mere existence. Human rights feature prominently in every political dialogue with our partners. Human rights subcommittees are being established with a growing number of partners, and, indeed, the European Union Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans contain highly detailed sections on human rights.  The Commission, as part of the troika, makes numerous dmarches on human rights issues every year, and the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights funds human rights projects throughout the world. The Commission is also funding numerous technical assistance projects with an impact on human rights, ranging from, for instance, improving police training to modernising the judicial system in partner countries. The rule of law is one of the most important areas where I think we can really make a difference.  I would also like to mention how active both Member State embassies and Commission delegations are in this regard. EU Heads of Mission collectively draw up human rights fact sheets periodically, report on the implementation of the various EU human rights guidelines and make detailed analyses of developments in particular countries concerning human rights and democracy. More and more frequently, political reporting from the Commission delegations is covering human rights issues.  Assessing the effectiveness of the human rights clause to date needs to be done in a comprehensive manner. The human rights and democracy clause is, in itself, an important way of demonstrating the shared commitment of the European Union and its partners to upholding, and also to promoting, human rights. The human rights clause opens the door to developing a deeper and more intensive dialogue on human rights issues. Moreover, the existence of these clauses may, in some cases, even help deter potential human rights violations.  As far as sanctions are concerned, I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States, as well as of the other states. I agree that, when sanctions are not implemented in response to serious breaches of human rights, the credibility of the EUs human rights policy could be damaged.  For its part, the Commission would sometimes like to see a more robust use of these clauses but the solution is not, however, to include more clauses in the agreement. Instead, we need to build up awareness and the consensus throughout the European Union on the importance of human rights issues relative to other priorities. This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard.  As regards Parliaments involvement in negotiating or suspending an agreement, you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union. Parliament already plays an invaluable role in focusing attention on human rights issues, through the extremely active work of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues. Moreover, I very much welcome the suggestion that interparliamentary delegations should take up human rights issues much more systematically. I think that there, too, you have a great role to play.  I also favour revising the format of the current EU Annual Report on Human Rights in order to make it a fully interinstitutional report and to include an analysis of the application of human rights clauses.  In conclusion, let me reiterate that the success of human rights clauses should be measured by the progress made in engaging partners in a genuine dialogue and in consultations on human rights, and the resulting improvements in human rights.  Over the last ten years, human rights clauses have provided an indispensable foundation for developing a truly effective human rights dialogue with our partners because it is in this way that these countries slowly change their behaviour. That does not mean, of course, that there is no room for improvement: there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament. We are in a listening mood, but we would also like to contribute to improving human rights in the world.
4018436 author: Sebastian Bush:  . Mr President, in May  1995  the Council decided that, to promote fundamental rights and the EUs democratic ideals, a clause insisting upon human rights observation should be included as an essential element of all bilateral agreements.  In the ten years since the clause was introduced it has stood up to rigorous examination by the European Court of Justice and has been introduced into more than  50  of the EUs agreements. However, in those ten years the EU has been criticised for failing to put its human rights tools in the field of external relations into practice and it has become increasingly apparent that when dealing with key countries, strategic partnerships and double standards of still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect.  By way of illustration, I make reference to the fact that, despite what we demand on paper, the debate sparked by the election of the new Palestinian Authority clearly spelled out that implementation depends primarily on the political will of the EU to assign priority to human rights issues over economic and political interests. Before the democratically elected Authority had the chance to organise itself, the EUPalestine Agreement was up for review on the basis of human rights in a way that has been dismissed by both the Council and the Commission as unhelpful because it would remove leverage. However, when probed about the EUIsrael Association Agreement, despite Israels catalogue of defiance of Security Council resolutions and blatant disregard of the International Court of Justice, as she continues to annex East Jerusalem and deny the Palestinian people the right to selfdetermination, what is the EUs response?  I have been a harsh critic of the handling of the EUIsrael Association Agreement, scrutinising the precise application of the human rights clause on numerous occasions on the floor of this House. Yet I hear nothing other than euphemisms, such as that we must maintain our influence and continue our dialogue. If the Council and the Commission cannot spell out to this House how it uses the human rights clause coherently, effectively and transparently, then how can it expect this House to be prepared to give its assent to new international agreements?  The vague criterion and inadequate procedures contained in this instrument have not helped me to penetrate the logic behind some EU decisions, nor does it help the EU to defend itself against accusations of ambivalence and discrimination in the face of serious human rights violations. A revised text must provide a concrete, stepbystep implemented mechanism, from dialogue to warning signals, and a spectrum of tools from smart sanctions to suspension, to add influence and authority to our interventions with persistent violators. Moreover, the instrument should be based on the principle of reciprocity with regard to abuses that take place on EU soil as well as those abroad. If anything has become clear from the controversy over unlawful CIA operations in Europe, it is that when it comes to human rights, the EU has failed to keep its own house in order.  The significance of this latest twist in the war on terror cannot be exaggerated, effectively shattering EU complacency about its own human rights record, with enquiries launched by the Council of Europe and this House with warnings that the sanctioning mechanism of Article 7  may be used. It is time for the EU to engage in a thorough and comprehensive review and to connect and balance the external and internal dimensions of its policy on human rights.  Whilst the EU has struggled to consistently and systematically promote a coherent view of human rights, this Parliament has been praised by NGOs for the positive impact of the revival of the Subcommittee on Human Rights. Under the chairmanship of Mrs Flautre the subcommittee has gone from strength to strength and, coupled with the appointment of Mr Michael Matheson, we have made inroads into the implementation of human rights guidelines.  I finish by saying that as human rights feature more prominently in a range of foreign and security policy domains, and as crosscutting issues demand more consistent participation, our knowledge and proficiency must be drawn on as joint decisionmaker when it comes to initiating consultations and suspending agreements on the basis of human rights.
10353222 author: Mary Brown:  . Mr President, since its birth two years ago, this proposal has been in the headlines. Both its supporters and its opponents see it as a symbol. During all the controversy about this proposal, which focused on a relatively small number of issues, it was easy to forget that there are many other areas in which, I believe, broad agreement exists and in which the benefits of the proposal are recognised.  Firstly, thanks to administrative simplification, it will be easier to establish a business in the EU. This is crucial for fostering entrepreneurship, a vital element in promoting growth and jobs. Service providers will be able to obtain information and to complete administrative formalities through single points of contact in any Member State, thus simplifying, accelerating and reducing the cost of the authorisation process and obviating the need to deal with different levels of authorities.  It will also be possible to fulfil these procedures electronically, so that businesses save time and avoid incurring considerable costs in having to make visits in person  sometimes several times  in order to complete the necessary formalities with the relevant authorities.  Secondly, it will be good for consumers. Improving consumer confidence is a key component in boosting the possibilities that the internal market offers them. They will benefit as key information about businesses and the service they are providing will be made easily available. This will enable them to make informed choices when they are purchasing services. Rights of consumers are clearly set out, and any discrimination on the basis of nationality or place of business must be removed.  Thirdly, Member States will have to implement administrative cooperation to ensure that businesses are properly and efficiently supervised across the EU, while avoiding duplication of control. This legal obligation will be underpinned at a practical level by an electronic system enabling authorities to exchange information directly and efficiently. These, amongst many others in the draft directive, are provisions which will bring forward significant benefits, both for businesses and consumers  I know that you have never lost sight of this.  In assessing the amendments adopted in the lead committees opinion, and the further amendments tabled since, the Commission is taking a highly constructive and positive position. In particular, we intend to take on board and incorporate in our revised proposal those amendments that we believe to be supported by a broad majority in this House.  The Commission broadly welcomes amendments put forward by the European Parliament which aim to clarify and improve the Commissions initial proposal. These relate mainly to administrative simplification, establishment and administrative cooperation.  The Commission also broadly welcomes many of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection in relation to services of general interest. This is a sensitive question that has split opinions during the entire debate and it is clear, in my view, that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection vote has achieved a great deal in this respect. On the other hand, I believe that services of general economic interest should stay within the scope of the proposal. Any further exclusions of sectors from the scope of the proposal should be extremely limited.  The compromise texts I have seen give us a good basis for producing our amended proposal if they are adopted. But we need to be clear about how we will deal with possible deletions from the proposal. If Parliament votes to delete Articles  24  and  25  of the proposal concerning the posting of workers, then the Commission will produce guidance to address any undue administrative burdens which may hinder the opportunities for enterprises to avail of the Posted Workers Directive. This can be done relatively quickly. There is wellestablished Court jurisprudence which needs to be complied with.  Equally, if health services are excluded from the scope of the directive, this does not take away from the necessity to address the increasing jurisprudence of the Court of Justice with regard to patient mobility. A separate proposal from the Commission addressing this issue will therefore be necessary.  The compromise texts also recognise the freedom that service providers should have to access markets in other Member States and to exercise their activities there. I welcome the fact that they recognise that a whole range of barriers to the provision of these services will have to be abolished while, of course, permitting certain restrictions on welldefined public policy grounds.  It is important to underline that any amendments we accept must meet the objective that this directive should represent a step towards the creation of an internal market for services. As Guardian of the Treaties, we also need to carry out our responsibility to ensure that what emerges is compatible with the fundamental freedoms as set out there and in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice.  In addition, any restrictions that Member States may apply to service providers from other Member States have to be judged against the criteria of nondiscrimination, necessity and proportionality. This must be borne in mind, particularly when we look at whatever modifications are voted to Article 16  and the freedom to provide services.  I am sure most Members will agree that this is the only way we can ensure that the real added value of this proposal is maintained. It will facilitate the crossborder provision of services and, at the same time, ensure that legitimate public policy considerations can be safeguarded. That is the balance we are all working for. It seems to me to be the essence of the compromise amendments on Article 16 .  I confirm that, following the vote on Thursday, the Commission will bring forward a revised proposal with a view to facilitating a common position as soon as possible  hopefully, before the end of April. Where there is broad consensus in this House on the amendments to be made, the Commission will, subject to what I said earlier, base its modified proposals on these amendments.  In the meantime, I look forward to todays debate and, ultimately, the outcome of Thursdays vote. Parliament has a real opportunity to show that, after two years work, it can provide the basis for taking forward in a consensual way an important but hugely controversial proposal. It is a challenge I believe most MEPs want to rise to. I urge you to continue to work for the consensus which I believe is within your grasp. You can deliver a better services directive which unleashes the enormous economic potential of the services sector. This is the basis on which we will be judged by the European businesses, workers, consumers and unemployed people that stand to benefit from it.
74086 author: Marc Smith:  . Mr President, today the core message from Liberals and Democrats is to safeguard and defend freedom of speech, not only in Europe but also in Kabul and Tehran. It is totally unacceptable for violent protests, attacks on embassies, burnings of flags and boycotting of goods to replace dialogue. That we have seen examples of a European company boycotting Danish goods is unfortunate and not a sign of European solidarity.  We have all been shocked and saddened by the terrible circumstances of the last  14 days, and no one has been more shocked than me and my fellow Danes. However, Muslims should recognise that the global tensions have merely increased support for farright, antiimmigration parties and have been abused by extremists in and outside Europe.  Europeans from all communities must now exercise personal responsibility to quell this rising tide of anger. We must not let extremists triumph at the expense of the moderate majority, and we must stand together in respect for Article 11  of the Treaty to condemn violence and intimidation against Member States. When the Danish flag and other European flags are burned, the EU should show solidarity, as we have seen today, and reject demands that governments should apologise on behalf of independent media ...  ... especially since Section 77  of the Constitutional Act of Denmark clearly states: Any person shall be at liberty to publish his ideas in print, in writing and in speech, subject to his being held responsible in a court of law. Censorship and other preventive measures shall never again be introduced.  It should also rebuff efforts by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League to seek a UN resolution, backed by possible sanctions, to ban attacks on religious beliefs. Such a move would contravene the constitutional basis of many liberal democracies and is an invitation to criminalise freedom of thought on a global scale.  Nobody is denying that Muslims have a right to feel offended by these drawings, just as Sikhs, Jews, Christians or believers of any sort have a right to take umbrage at the press. However, complaints must be handled through the appropriate legal channels. In a civilised society, offence can never be grounds for violence. In a secular, democratic society such as our own, freedom of the press must remain paramount, for it is this freedom that reinforces the principles of democracy and pluralism on which our Union is founded and which are universally acknowledged in international conventions. As such, all believers should stand up for those values, which ensure that anyone in Europe can practise their religion freely and openly, but also accept the right to be a nonbeliever.  This is not to say that freedom of the press should mean total freedom to cause offence. It is selfevident that, after  911  and the bombings in Madrid and London, greater care must be taken to ensure that relations between different communities remain as harmonious as possible. However, Liberals and Democrats are convinced that the current situation cannot be resolved by the thought police, but only through dialogue. From that perspective, we support the Alliance of Civilisations initiative proposed by the UN SecretaryGeneral, and we applaud Justice Commissioner Frattini for organising a round table with media bosses, journalists and religious leaders. But, Mr Frattini, we draw the line at supporting your proposed code of conduct for the press, and we encourage Mr Solana to draw exactly the same line. That way lies greater distrust and mutual antagonism, because if communities cannot discuss issues on their cultural fault lines, how will they ever grow into acceptance?  Before I close in Danish, I just want to thank personally the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and my colleagues here in this Chamber for showing their solidarity.  Freedom of expression is a right, but not necessarily a duty. It is, however, a right that must be neither called into question nor compromised. If we begin to compromise our freedom of expression and, at the same time, suspend our right to subject all religions to critical analysis, the fundamental right to think and to express ourselves freely will be restricted.
6913016 author: Jennifer Merx:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by warmly welcoming the focus of Austria, as the Presidency, on the western Balkans. I very much look forward to working together with the Presidency, the Council and Parliament to achieve the next important steps to bring the western Balkans closer to the European Union.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is genuinely at a crossroads today. Last November the country started to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union. A new High RepresentativeEU Special Representative, Mr Christian SchwarzSchilling, has succeeded Lord Ashdown in Sarajevo. Mr SchwarzSchilling will make less use of the executive powers and leave more tasks in the hands of BiH politicians. We are now in an era of increasing Bosnian ownership and responsibility.  Before I outline some recent developments and our policy goals, let me apologise in advance if I have to leave the House before the end of the debate today. I am scheduled to leave at  4  p.m. this afternoon with President Barroso on a threeday round trip of six cities in the western Balkans, ending in Sarajevo on Saturday. So I hope we will be finished by  4  p.m.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is making its way through the stabilisation and association process. Last November in Sarajevo we officially opened the negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement. The first real negotiating round took place at the end of January  2006 . It went very well and our Bosnian partners had prepared themselves thoroughly.  The Commissions working hypothesis is that negotiations will take about one year. However, meeting this target date will entail Bosnia and Herzegovina being able to respond to all the EU reform requirements. In this respect, it is essential for Bosnia and Herzegovina to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. In order to avoid any misconceptions, let me make it clear that there is no short cut: full cooperation is a necessary condition to conclude a stabilisation and association agreement and to make progress in negotiations. It is also essential to implement the agreement on the restructuring of the police forces, to adopt and implement all necessary public broadcasting legislation and, not least, to ensure sufficient legislative and administrative capacity to implement the agreement. We thus have a very clear message: Bosnia and Herzegovina should seize the opportunity that it has at hand. For this, reforms need to continue with the utmost determination.  It is fair to say that the international community has played an important role in supporting the reforms in the country. But credit is also due to the local authorities, which have been able to achieve significant progress in what, to say the least, is a rather complex environment. We hope that progress will continue and that local political ownership will increase further. We are ready to support this process fully. The international community will adapt its role to these evolving circumstances of more local ownership. The more the country is able to demonstrate maturity and political ownership, the less the international community will need to intervene. I met recently with the new HREUSR, Mr SchwarzSchilling, who shares this view on a new role for the international community and the use of the Bonn powers.  The reform of the Dayton Constitution is another important challenge before the Bosnian political leaders. The country needs a constitution that ensures full compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights; allows effective decisionmaking and efficient governance; and makes the government structure less costly for ordinary citizens and taxpayers.  In other words, it is necessary for the country to develop a democratic, functional and affordable multiethnic state in order better to serve all its citizens and to support the reforms that EU integration entails and necessitates. Therefore, I welcome the recent efforts by the leading political parties and political leaders to find practical and workable solutions to these very important challenges. I encourage political leaders to continue their dialogue so as to achieve more ambitious results. We do not expect a constitutional revolution but rather an evolution. Constitutional evolution has to be a consensusdriven process with the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly in the drivers seat. The international community can act as facilitator; we can offer encouragement and support; but the Bosnian politicians must take the lead.  The constitutional evolution is not as such a condition for concluding the negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement. But we need to underline that the European Union clearly has a big stake in this process. In other words, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to make sure that its constitutional provisions guarantee full and effective implementation of the stabilisation and association agreement and thus pave the way for the countrys road towards Europe.  I look forward to engaging with the European Parliament again on a future occasion on the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
3736843 author: Michael Finlayson:  . Mr President, Commissioner FerreroWaldner had very much hoped to be with you to discuss Belarus. She has been intensely engaged in developing the Commissions activities on Belarus since we took office and I am convinced she will not miss the opportunity to discuss Belarus with the Russian Foreign Minister at their meeting that is being held in Vienna today.  On behalf of Commissioner FerreroWaldner and the Commission I am pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the situation in Belarus in the runup to the  19 March presidential election and on the Commissions work to support democratisation and to support civil society.  Let me start by saying a few words on the overall situation in Belarus. The Commission is still deeply concerned about the absence of democracy and the lack of respect for human rights in Belarus. This situation has further deteriorated as the election date is nearing and has resulted in a severe quashing of the voice of the opposition and the stifling of the independent press over the last few months.  The fact that an OSCE mission has been invited to observe the presidential election and that a number of contenders to President Lukashenko are likely to be allowed to contest the presidential race is a welcome move, but not sufficient evidence of a functioning democracy. At this juncture, when the OSCE observers have started their work on the ground, it is important that the European Union and the Commission contribute to the smooth functioning of the mission. The European Unions opinion and reaction will be based on this missions report.  In terms of the European Unions response, you are well aware of the unequivocal message that the European Union conveyed to Belarus and reiterated in the General Affairs and External Relations Council of  30 January: the European Union has stressed the importance it attaches to a democratic election process and has also clearly voiced its resolve to issue targeted sanctions in the event that these elections prove to be fraudulent. To balance this message with a positive note, the European Union has repeated its offer to have closer relations with Belarus, provided that we see convincing progress towards democracy.  Let me now turn to the Commissions specific action and underline that the Commission has made good on its pledge to raise its role in Belarus. Faced with growing repression and restrictions by the Government of Belarus on foreign assistance to nongovernmental bodies, the Commission has stepped up and speeded up such assistance to Belarus. In  2005  alone, up to EUR 8 . 9 million have been dedicated to democracy and civil society projects. Creative tools have been developed to overcome the hurdles to assistance delivery. We have thus shifted part of our support to NGOs located outside Belarus. The EUR 2 . 2 million we granted last December to the European Humanitarian University in exile, as well as our support to independent media, are vibrant examples of this novel approach.  In the field of independent media, I am delighted to say that the Commission has been at the forefront of donors action. We have started with support to the radio broadcasting of daily news reports to Belarus in both Russian and Belarusian. However, our main achievement is a EUR 2 million media project which is now being launched. It includes radio and television broadcasting, internet activities, support to the Belarusian independent press, and the training of Belarusian journalists. The project will allow the broadcasting of specific TV and radio programmes as from February, well ahead of the elections. We believe this highquality project, which is supported by a Europewide team and sharply factors in Belarusian sensitivities  that is, no propaganda, straight news and sheer entertainment  will rightly reach out to large segments of the population.  In addition, the Commission has decided to open a delegation in Minsk but unfortunately the Belarusian authorities have not yet given their agreement. Pending progress on this front, we will post a charg daffaires to Kiev who will travel frequently to Minsk.  Finally, last Monday the Commission brought together all international donors to Belarus in order to plan ahead. This meeting has set in motion a common reflection on assistance beyond the election date. This meeting was a signal that assistance and coordination will not dwindle after the election date.  In conclusion, let me emphasise that the democratic process in Belarus is likely to be a long process that will eventually succeed only with the support of the population. This is why we must continue our efforts to raise awareness among the Belarusian population at large through support to civil society and facilitation of contacts between the people. As Belarus stands at the crossroads, it is more crucial than ever that we all pool our efforts to implement a common strategy and be ready to react to developments in Belarus as they take place. The Commission remains committed to doing its part.
2118312 author: Philip Whittacker:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to this debate. Many of the points mentioned in the report are covered by the ongoing studies that the Commission has initiated, for example, proposals  2 ,  5 ,  7 ,  19  and  23 .  Regarding the safetynet provision  proposal  8   the discussion in the Council has not produced a clear mandate for introducing a general safety clause in all COMs or for trying to finance this insurance out of the modulated money. However, I am ready to examine the introduction of targeted risk and crisis management provisions in other COMs and, as mentioned by Mr Gklavakis, in the fruit and vegetable sector, which we will also discuss here in Parliament at the end of this year.  I completely agree with your rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that basic coverage against income reduction is not a solution. It is quite clear that, if or when we face structural problems, they must be solved through policy changes. That is obvious and I am very happy about Mr Graefe zu Baringdorfs clear support for it.  As a safetynet for income, I consider the CAP reforms decoupled direct payment to the farmer to be essential.  I am positive about the content of proposals  18 ,  24  and  26 .  I also take this opportunity to draw your attention to the review of the state aid guidelines adopted by the Commission on  8 February. The Commission proposes to include compensation for bad weather and animal and plant diseases in the present exemption regulation for state aid within the agricultural sector. This is hopefully a simplification. It would also speed up the implementation of state aid in such situations, so that we can react extremely quickly.  The Commission has looked into a number of options for encouraging the development of risk crisis management tools and providing an improved response in the event of a crisis. My intention for the communication was, firstly, to have a comprehensive orientation debate in the Council and here in Parliament before tabling any legislative proposal. The discussions we have had so far in the Council have not, as I said, produced a clear mandate to introduce a general safety clause. However, the Commission is ready to proceed further if there should at any stage be a clear mandate from the Council.  Since I consider crisis and risk management an important issue for the future as well, even in the situation of an absence of a clear mandate from the Council I am prepared to examine the introduction of a crisis management provision, as I said previously, on a casebycase basis.  There was a question about the position of the new Member States. It is quite clear that the new Member States will not be excluded from risk management measures. As we have pointed out in the communication, we could envisage identifying a comparable envelope in rural development, just as we do for the old Member States  a clear signal to the ten new Member States.  With the political agreement on the CAP reform and the implementation that has now taken place in all the Member States, we want European farmers to try and seize the market opportunities. There is a strong responsibility for the farmer, but there is also a need for solidarity when crises arise. Listening to the discussions in the European Parliament as well as in the Council, it seems to me that the approaches are fairly different. My conclusion is, therefore, that we need to study the options carefully and discuss them before taking a final decision on the instruments to be used.  I agree completely with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that prevention is usually better than cure and my personal view is that the conference on coexistence to be held in April is necessary in order to avoid GMOs being mixed with organic production. I am therefore particularly looking forward to that discussion.  As for your views on fossil fuels, I do not think that we should wait until we have used up those fuels; we should start now to look at what can be done on renewable energy. I am thinking specifically about our recent discussions on bioethanol and the possibility of taking full advantage of agricultures contribution to this future way of reducing our carbon dioxide emissions.  This has been an interesting discussion and I thank the rapporteur for what I consider to be a balanced approach to this very important issue.
10478291 author: Michael Finlayson:  . Mr President, I have been greatly encouraged by the very engaged and highly interesting debate on this important issue, and I should like now to refer to some of the questions that have been raised during our discussion.  On vertical integration in the Commission, two main points must be noted. Firstly, the Commission has very recently set up a new unit in its DirectorateGeneral for Agriculture and Rural Development with a much stronger focus on forestry. This unit is presently coordinating the preparatory work on the EU forest action plan and chairs the meetings of the interservice group on forestry.  Secondly, the interservice group on forestry, which was established in  2002  to facilitate cooperation and coordination of forestryrelated work between relevant Commission services, has proved to be an effective tool of coordination and is working very satisfactorily. Its membership has increased and now comprises  11  Commission services. It is very actively involved in the preparation of the action plan and will have a very important role in its implementation.  Regarding the legal basis, several legal studies have been carried out in the Member States concerning the creation of a separate legal basis for forestry in the Treaties. In our opinion, unless the position of the Member States changes, the added value of further legal studies on this issue is questionable.  Regarding the concerns raised about the establishment of a European forest observatory, I believe that this should be discussed primarily among the Member States, which have the main responsibility for our forestry policy. They can assess the added value of such an initiative in the light of the current structures and existing international institutions.  I am aware of the importance of the problem of forest fires in the European Union and the need to continue to prevent these situations from arising. I had the opportunity to see the horrible consequences of these forest fires last year during a visit to Portugal. The current Rural Development Regulation provides support to the Member States for important forest fire prevention measures, such as fire breaks, water points and preventive sylviculture, as well as for the restoration of the forestry production potential in forests that have been damaged by fires.  I should like to indicate that these actions will be continued during the period  20072013  under the new Rural Development Regulation, and Member States will, therefore, have the possibility to include forest fire prevention measures in their rural development programmes. The rural development measures will be complemented by the actions that will be undertaken under the LIFE programme for the next financial period.  In this respect, following an initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission will launch a study to examine the main causes of forest deterioration in Europe, including forest fires, and the efficiency of the current measures, as well as possible future options to improve the situation.  Quite a few honourable Members mentioned stateowned forests. It is clear that the main objective for rural development is to revitalise rural areas and not to finance public authorities activities. This is why the main target group of beneficiaries of the rural development measures related to forestry is the private sector, notably farmers, foresters and, under axis  3  in the rural development policy, the broader rural society. However, there are derogations concerning the exclusion of stateowned forests from support under the new Rural Development Regulation in order to take into account the specific situations of certain regions and the characteristics of particular measures.  Finally, I shall make two comments on the content of the action plan. Firstly, the action plan will be designed in accordance with the key principles of the European Union forestry strategy. The main responsibility for forest policy lies with the Member States, and actions at Community level will continue to be based on the principle of subsidiarity. Our intention is to concentrate Community actions on those areas where there is a clear added value.  The second point is that the action plan will also identify Community instruments that can be used by the Member States for the implementation of the proposed actions, for instance, the new Rural Development Regulation, the LIFE instrument or  as was also mentioned here  the seventh Research Framework Programme. In this respect, the action plan will strengthen the overall visibility of forestry and increase the complementarity of different Community actions in support of sustainable forest management.  Concerning the specific proposals in the report, the Commission welcomes the recommendations contained in paragraphs  1 ,  4 ,  7 ,  11 ,  12 ,  14 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  24 ,  26  and  29 . There are a number of recommendations, notably paragraphs  3 ,  5 ,  6 ,  8 ,  10 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  22 ,  23  and  30 , which are addressed also to the Member States, and the Commission will discuss these specific proposals with the Member States when we elaborate further on the action plan.  The Commission has also taken good note of recommendation  9 , and we will look into it: coordination is certainly an issue to be addressed.  Finally, there are a number of recommendations, such as  2 ,  13 ,  15 ,  25 ,  27 ,  28 ,  30  and  32 , which will go beyond the key principle of the European forest strategy or may not be completely in line with the regulations already adopted.  Once again, I thank you for an extremely interesting and very good report and also for this engaged discussion, which has been very supportive.
3002935 author: James McNabb:  . Mr President, I shall firstly express my thanks to Parliament and particularly to its rapporteur, MrPaasilinna, for his very detailed report. He has been working very closely with the other rapporteurs and has gathered their opinions. To all of them I express my thanks.  It is very encouraging to see that Parliament shares the Commissions main concerns and the policy priorities for the information society over the next five years. As the various committees and rapporteurs have shown, it is very difficult to predict today how the information society of tomorrow will look, and that is why we opted for a broad and ambitious strategic framework, instead of a detailed action plan, because this strategic framework allows for review and adjustments in response to emerging challenges. The i 2010  framework thus seeks to provide a futureproof policy framework.  I am very pleased to note that Parliament and the Commission share a position on the key elements of i 2010 : commitments to make ICT legislation forwardlooking and responsive to the changes brought about by converging. So, it must be technologically neutral and supportive of competition, and at the same time Member States must implement fully the existing regulatory framework which, unfortunately, is not always the case, but you know that I am fighting to get that done.  We see a similar need for the approach to spectrum management which can respond to rapid technological developments and changes in demand and which is supported by regulators, operators and others involved. Here we will have a lot of work in the next few months.  Our shared priorities also include support for the EUs creation and distribution of European content, the protection of intellectual property, the promotion of security and the protection of users against harmful content. The Commission and Parliament are also of one mind when it comes to urging Member States and businesses to invest more into ICT research, and we see the same need for ensuring appropriate financial resources for ICT in FP 7  and CIP.  We also agree on the need to promote and protect citizens rights in the information society and that is why we need to raise the awareness of citizens on how their rights, freedom of expression, privacy, personal data protection and right to receive or communicate information can be exercised in the information society.  Together with Parliament I would urge the Member States to use their national reform plans in order to address their own ICT priorities, to improve their public services, such as egovernment initiatives, where I see a lot of progress in the move to invest more in the exploitation of ICT in publicsector services.  Like Parliament, I am worried about the digital divide. We have to ensure that everyone can participate; not only people who live in cities; not only people who have a certain level of education; not only young people. This is a very strong goal and an opportunity to be seized. We will work together on steps to bridge this digital divide.  When I refer to digital divide, I also mean the promotion of digital literacy for all, which leads me to the participation of women in all ICTrelated fields of academia and business. There is good news: our statistics show that gender is no longer the main factor in the digital divide; that factor is diminishing very rapidly. I am encouraged by this, but that does not mean that we should not do anything to solve the residual problem. We have to work together and continue our efforts to promote greater gender balance in ICTrelated fields such as science. In many governments, initiatives are being taken to that end.  I agree with you on the crucial importance of the Internet for an economy based on information. That is why the EU also played an active role in brokering the agreement on the progressive internationalisation of Internet governance at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis last year. In my view, that is the best approach to Internet governance. The Commission, together with Parliament, will proceed by organising a forum later this year.  I am also stepping up monitoring activities in the field of media pluralism and will shortly publish a working paper on that issue. The working paper is going to be a stocktaking exercise to capture the wide range of different circumstances across the Member States, but at the same time  and I keep reiterating this  my views on ownership and media pluralism have not changed. Ownership issues are a matter for Member States: they must take their responsibilities and exercise them in an effective manner in line with the subsidiarity principle. That is why the Commission simply supports the Member States; it does not dictate to them in this important area of national life.  Having said that, I promised you that I would follow this up and cooperate with you in that regard. I will shortly be proposing measures to that effect to this House.  Concerning your call to speed up the einclusion initiative  which is planned for  2008   I urge you not just to see the date of  2008 , because  2008  is the time when we will have reached our objective. In order to reach it, we are preparing things now. So I have spoken with the forthcoming EU Presidencies of Finland, Germany and Portugal, and practical actions will be built up until we reach the einclusion initiative in  2008 .  Since the publication of the i 2010  action plan, we have significantly raised awareness of ICT issues. We have started to make progress on key objectives, with the adoption of several proposals, with other proposals in the pipeline and with initiatives that were not inscribed in the i 2010  initiative. The flexibility of the action plan allows us to add initiatives whenever necessary. The latest one I took involves consultation on RFIDs, which bring together economic necessity and the necessity to protect the privacy of our citizens.  However, achievement of our ambitious objective requires adequate financial resources. As soon as an interinstitutional agreement on the Financial Perspective is reached, we need to see important decisions and adjustments named in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme. I therefore urge you to ensure that those two programmes are granted the basic necessary financial resources in order to support ICT as a driver for competitiveness and growth. I am very glad to see that this is a shared opinion and goal not only in this House but also in the three institutions, and that is a guarantee of success.
8643836 author: Lynne Merx:  . Mr President, in response to the very welcome questions, let me stress that I am strongly committed to developing the twoway trade and investment relationship between Europe and China and with other Asian markets, including Vietnam. There is no greater prize, in my view, for European trade policy in the coming years than the prize of getting those relationships right.  I believe that Europe must respect and adjust to the natural advantages those economies have, shifting our own focus to sectors and to products where our own skills and technologies give us the edge. That is how trade grows and that is how Europes economies have grown over centuries.  The European footwear industry is in the front line of global competition. For all their ingenuity, creativity and excellence, Europes leathershoe makers are faced with an extraordinary challenge from Asias producers. However, the case of dumping requires me to distinguish between this tough new competition, on the one hand, and genuinely unfair trade on the other.  Europes trade defence measures target unfair trade. They cannot protect us from tough competition. They cannot shield us from Asias natural and legitimate lowcost advantages. However, when those comparative advantages are topped up by unfair and uncompetitive practice, we have a right and an obligation to act. That is why, having been presented with a preliminary analysis and assessment by my services, I have recommended to the Commission and to Member States provisional duties in this case.  There is clear evidence of serious state intervention in the leather footwear sector in China and Vietnam: cheap finance, tax breaks, nonmarket land rents and improper asset valuation leading to dumping. That dumping is causing serious injury to EU producers.  The dumping duties that I am recommending will ensure that retailers with goods in transit are not suddenly faced with unexpected costs at the border. I am suggesting that they be phased in over a period of five months, beginning at about  4  in April. It means that importers can plan ahead over the next six months with a maximum of transparency and predictability. It nevertheless means that after six months the full duty will be in place and the damaging effects of dumping will be counteracted.  As I am required by law to do, I have pondered the question of consumer and retailer interest in this case very seriously. I have proposed to exclude hightech sports shoes which are no longer produced in significant numbers in Europe. I also propose to exclude childrens shoes so as to be sure that even small price rises are not passed on to poorer families.  I know that some are worried about the possible impact on consumer prices. I believe, on the basis of the facts, that there is a margin within the supply chain to absorb a small duty on import costs by spreading it across product ranges and the distribution chain. As I have said, these are proposals for provisional measures. They will be discussed with Member States and must be confirmed by the College of Commissioners.  I believe that I am proposing a balanced solution that deserves the backing of Member States and this House. It corrects the injury but allows maximum predictability for importers and passes on minimal additional costs to consumers. There will be no quotas, no limit at all on imports of leather shoes from China and Vietnam. I have told the Chinese and Vietnamese Governments that I want to work with them to see how they can address the concerns raised by the EU investigation.  Imposing a duty on dumped goods is not protectionism. It is not a question of asking consumers to subsidise uncompetitive European producers, because the easy comparison is too often made. It is also worth being clear that shoes are not the next textiles. The textile issue concerned fairlytraded textile imports. Our proposed antidumping measures on leather shoes tackle, in contrast, unfair competition. The Commission has a legal obligation to investigate such a claim and a legal right to protect European producers against such practice.  Some of your questions address the overall situation in the European footwear sector. Let me address this briefly. The contraction of the footwear sector is a longterm process that began long before trade in footwear with China was liberalised in  2005 . Nonetheless, it is clear that there have been winners and losers from this change. Some producers have increased their exports and others, including Turkey and some of the ACP countries, have seen their exports to the EU and elsewhere hold steady or fall.  Clearly, it is China, equipped with a staggering production and export capacity, that has benefited most. Here in Europe, more than  40000  footwear jobs have been lost and more than  1000  footwear companies have closed down since  2001 . European production of leather shoes has fallen by  30  and profit margins have been heavily squeezed to just over  1 .  However, we should not pretend that this intense competitive pressure on European footwear producers is related solely to dumped goods. In large part, these are the consequences of changing production and consumption patterns in the global economy. I believe we should accept this, while helping those affected to adjust to these changes. We should also acknowledge that European producers have significantly contributed to the change by relocating their production to Asia in quite a number of cases. As a result, we need to take into account a range of European producer interests in assessing our interests in this matter.  Rising to the Asian challenge places great demands on our businesses and workers. The Commissions growth and job strategy is built on the idea that Europe must commit itself to equipping todays Europeans to respond to this challenge and to create tomorrows jobs. We cannot block globalisation and economic change. I do not believe it is in Europes interests to try. Those who think that the Trade Commissioner can reverse global economic change are asking King Canute to hold back the tide.  However, we can shape globalisation, even harness its dynamic potential for renewal and, indeed, for innovation in Europe. I believe that the broader footwear issue confronts us with that imperative. We must invest in change, invest in those affected by change, but face up to the changing world in doing so. We must also be robust in our defence of the rules and of fair competition. We need to recognise that if we want to win the wider political argument for free trade, we must be ready to defend and stand up for fair trade.  However, we cannot deny Asia its comparative advantages or the competitive industry that is lifting hundreds of millions in the developing world out of poverty. The only sustainable balance to that competition is the creativity, innovation and commitment of European companies themselves, reinforced with the appropriate help from political authorities.  I am happy to return to any of these points in detail and to answer points that any Member may subsequently raise.
4278987 author: Nancy Bush:  . Mr President, if you do not mind I shall not go along the course of answering the point about bed linen at this precise moment. In the time I have available I think it would be better to stick to shoes, but I can assure you that the question of any antidumping duty on bed linen will be properly assessed and properly applied as, in my opinion, it is at the moment.  I think that the value of debates such as this and the important role of this Parliament are demonstrated by the very important and insightful observations that have been made during the last  45  minutes. My role on behalf of the Commission is to listen to what honourable Members have to say and to reflect very carefully on the points and arguments that have been raised. I can assure you I will reflect on them and on the observations made by Member States so that when I come back to the Commission with final recommendations I will be able to do so having heard the variety, diversity and range of different points and arguments that have been made.  However, having heard so many people this afternoon complain that my intervention is protectionist, unnecessary and unjustified, alongside a slightly greater number of Members of this House who have complained that I am not going far enough, my actions are inadequate and that I should go further, I am tempted to make the easy observation that perhaps I have got the measures just about right between those two rival points of view! However, tempting as it is to make that rather cheap observation, I am going to avoid doing so.  I should like to say, though, that I agree particularly with Mr Papastamkos and Mrs Safi, both of whom see the need to intervene against anticompetitive and tradedistorting behaviour by our partners, but at the same time to do so with a degree of perspective and balance that I think it behoves me to uphold. I think Mr Assis is right in that, in the provisional measures that are introduced, it is important that we maintain careful monitoring and surveillance of the effect of what we are doing so as to ensure that, if there is circumvention of our duties, we are able to review the situation and perhaps take revised action when we come to the definitive stage of our measures later this year.  Let me very quickly respond to some of the other points that have been made.  Some have drawn a parallel between the proposed action on shoes and the action that we took on textiles. They are very different cases. In the case of textiles, we were dealing with fairlytraded goods, albeit subject to a dramatic and sudden increase in volume following the lifting of quotas on Chinese textiles at the beginning of  2005 . We therefore took a safeguard measure by the introduction of quotas, as we are entitled to do. We were not, as in this case, dealing with anticompetitive measures  dumping actions  that attract an antidumping measure in the form of a tariff duty  not a quota and not a physical limit. Therefore I do not anticipate our running into the temporary teething problems that we had in the case of textiles. This should be remembered by those who describe the textile period as involving us in some sort of war or battle with China. Far from it. We were able to agree with China the measures that we took, in a very unwarlike way.  Two other points were raised by a number of Members. One concerns the impact on consumer prices. Let us put this case into perspective. It concerns only nine pairs of shoes from every  100  pairs bought by European consumers; in other words, a fraction of the product range. A duty would be just over EUR  1 . 50  on average wholesale prices of EUR 8 . 50  on shoes which then sell for between EUR  40  and EUR  120 , as opposed to a duty which would simply amount to EUR  1 . 50 . Please do not tell me that EUR  1 . 50  cannot be absorbed across the supply chain by importers and retailers, especially importers and retailers who have benefited from low import prices from China and Vietnam but who have not passed on the effects of those cheaper import prices to consumers  a question that consumers may put to their retailers if they are able to encounter them at some stage in the future.  A number of Members have asked me why I am proposing to exclude sports technology shoes and childrens shoes. In the case of the sports shoes, these are excluded from the investigation because they are not produced in Europe in sufficient quantity to qualify as being potentially harmed by dumping. There is therefore no injury to European producers because they barely exist in the case of these sports shoes.  In the case of childrens shoes, the exclusion I am proposing is on the grounds of Community interest. Young children need three to four pairs of new shoes per year. The impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes.  In my view, parents should not see any potential hurdles put in the way of buying goodquality shoes for their children. Those who want me to reclassify the customs segmentation for these shoes should bear in mind that the customs classification for children is up to size  37  with heels less than  3 cm. Whilst I am prepared to discuss that with my colleagues in TAXUD, it is a classification that I am given, not one that I propose.  Let me make just briefly one or two other quick observations. There was a suggestion that the investigation had taken too long. This sampling takes time. I am obliged by the regulations that exist within the European Community to observe very strict procedures and use very strict reference countries and companies when I am investigating those of another country that does not enjoy market economy status.  Therefore, just as I cannot anticipate dumping complaints  some Members were complaining that I do not show enough foresight, as if I have a crystal ball before me that is going to reveal where the next dumping complaint is going to come from  I cannot preempt proper procedures and investigations that are laid out in our regulations and which I am obliged to follow in detail.  Let me reply to the suggestion that somehow there was a breach of confidentiality. I do not understand this. Member States received the Commissions working document before my press conference on  23 February. The moment these working documents go out to Member States I can assure you that they are as good as published to the media. I therefore have to clarify them immediately and explain and justify what I am doing. This certainly does not deprive Member States of their right to express an opinion on the case or to receive detailed replies from the Commissions services.  I shall leave the matter there, except to say in conclusion that it is very important that we see what is happening in China, Vietnam, India and other Asian countries in some perspective. Of course there is tough competition and there is a difficult challenge for European producers and manufacturers to rise to, and we have an obligation to do everything we can to help European producers rise to this challenge and to help those employed in companies adjust to the challenges and the new circumstances of international trade which we are experiencing. I do not believe that a proper and legitimate way of helping people to adjust to these new forces in the global economy is to encourage people to shelter from them or to pretend that, if we close our eyes or cover our heads with a blanket, these changes, challenges and new sources of competition will somehow go away and leave us alone so that we do not have to respond to them.  Any politician giving that sort of message to the public would be guilty of false leadership, and poor leadership to the public, who need to understand what is going on and help to respond to it. We cannot maintain the pretence that we in Europe, by retreating from the competitive challenge we are facing in the global economy, will somehow be able to hide from it and, at the same time, maintain our living standards and our prosperity in the future. We cannot and will not do that.  We have to respond to this challenge by putting the emphasis on our competitiveness, innovation and ability to respond to change and to compete more effectively in the future. If we do not rise to that challenge and do not set that out to our public, we cannot blame them subsequently for reacting with fear and mystification to what is taking place in the global economy.
3794566 author: Lynne White:  . Mr President, the report which I have presented for Parliaments consideration and approval outlines the main guidelines for the  2007  budget pertaining to other institutions. The main part of my report, however, is dedicated to Parliaments budget.  The report places major emphasis on the need to consolidate what has been successfully achieved in these last few years. No major projects are being contemplated for  2007 , which should provide us with enough time to carry out an indepth stocktaking exercise and enable us to examine and evaluate critically and objectively what needs to be done in the coming years.  In a framework of budgetary constraint, we need to implement budgetary rigour in all ongoing activities, ensuring added value for taxpayers money. I wish to stress the importance of the application of activitybased budgeting, which would result in more rational and analytical estimates. Moreover, appropriations should relate to specific activities. This would help to avoid cancellation of appropriations at the end of the year.  The institutions have to base their estimates on welldefined needs, avoiding duplication of functions, focusing on core operations and eliminating malpractice and all bottlenecks. In this respect, the institutions are invited to make better use of their resources, leading to more interinstitutional cooperation, which should be conducive to more efficiency and hopefully more savings. It is reasonable to assume that some administrative tasks could be shared amongst the institutions, without the latter losing their independence. This could create economies of scale and increase the effectiveness of services.  Another key issue in the report relates to information policy, which addresses Parliaments objective of bringing Europe and its institutions closer to its citizens. In order to improve the perception that the citizens have of the Union, the implementation of an effective, strong information strategy is crucial. Having said that, however, I still contend that in any information project particular attention should be given to the extent of participation and cooperation of political groups, the pluralism of opinion, the value of its contents and its cost structure. In the final analysis, the level of success of any project will have to be measured in terms of its positive impact on EU citizens.  In terms of staffing, keeping in mind the exceptionally strong recruitment exercise which took place in the last three years and the Streamline software system, which should be in place by the end of the year, it would be justified to assume that with the exception of enlargement and an extremely limited recruitment of specialised staff, no new employment should take place in  2007 , which would result in real economies in the future.  In my report I also addressed a number of additional priorities for  2007 , relating mainly to buildings policy, enlargement, assistance to Members, a statute for Members assistants, and training. Regrettably, in view of time constraints, I will be unable to deal with all those topics in any detail.  It is unfortunate that this budgetary procedure starts in a context of uncertainty, due to the absence of a new interinstitutional agreement. Understandably, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives but not at any cost. We cannot and should not pay lip service to highflown buzzwords such as growth, employment, research, social solidarity and enlargement and at the same time not provide the funds or flexibility to achieve them. In other words, if we really mean what we say, we should put our money where our mouth is.  Moreover, and under these circumstances, it would be advisable, at least at this stage, to work on the assumption that we will be retaining the selfimposed ceiling of  20  of Category  5  expenditure. Having said that, however, we know that the selfimposed ceiling is not an irrefutable and fixed law. In future we should not be hesitant to challenge and review this agreement if we are truly convinced that it makes more financial and budgetary sense to do so.  In conclusion, I trust the various guidelines highlighted in this report, if effectively adopted, will improve the efficiency, quality, performance and transparency of the European institutions, offering more added value to the European citizens and hopefully more added value to the institutions credibility.
2622148 author: Sebastian Cameron:  .  Mr President, I will start my presentation on promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods by reminding Parliament that in recent times fishermen collectively have been seriously under attack.  Because of illegal actions by the few, there is a growing public perception that collectively fishermen are all potential criminals. I say to colleagues and especially to you, Commissioner, that this has to stop. Are there dishonest people in the fisheries sector? Of course there are, just like in every other sector  economic or otherwise  known to man. If someone is guilty of criminal activity then let the full force of the appropriate law apply. On the other hand, we must put a stop to the insidious branding of the entire fisheries profession with the same brush of dishonesty. We must never forget that the great majority of men and women involved in the sector are honest, dedicated and extremely hardworking people.  Furthermore, no meaningful change can be achieved without the active involvement and participation of those honest fishermen and women. In recent years the key challenge to maintaining sustainable fisheries has, to a large extent, developed into an overly simplistic and polarising debate on whether or not we should have more or less fishing. In reality the challenge of rebuilding stocks and maintaining sustainability is also about developing new and better ways of fishing through the utilisation and development of new technology.  The objective of maintaining sustainability must, most centrally, embrace the question of how we fish in the future so that we harvest our marine resources in the most environmentally favourable way. The introduction of fishing practices that reduce adverse impacts on our ecosystems is a priority. To achieve that we must first understand the effects of fishing practices on the marine environment and promote fishing activities that are environmentally sustainable. I am particularly pleased that the last Irish Presidency proposed the initiative of a major EU programme to make fishing activity more environmentally friendly in order to help to build European fish stocks.  This is an urgent matter. The urgency is clearly illustrated by one extraordinary statistic:  20  million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year, equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches. In the words of the then Irish Presidency, overfishing is part of the overall problem; but taking that amount of fish out of the seas and then throwing it overboard is shockingly wasteful and has to be substantially reduced in the short term. I am sure that you will agree with me that we are going nowhere unless that happens, and that we must do something positive about it.  It is gratifying that we in the European Union are prepared to take the lead to tackle that worldwide problem and deal with such a wasteful sideeffect of the fishing industry. The proposed environmental programme includes a review of all existing technical conservation measures within the next two years, to reduce ecosystem and environmental damage. It includes the proposal to fasttrack the development of more selective fishing gear. It proposes the simplification of our current rules with a view to facilitating those changes.  I started my presentation in defence of fishermen. I conclude my presentation by underlining that it is our fishermen and women who will have a central role in deciding the future of the European fishing industry. Fishermen and women will have their say in this process through their regional advisory councils, which will have an extremely important role to play. There is no doubt in my mind that fishermen will fully subscribe to this new environmentally friendly approach. They will do so because it will contribute to sustainable fisheries. They will do so because it will contribute to improving fish stocks. They will do so because it will ensure that fish stocks are properly preserved for future generations.  Commissioner, if you want this programme to work then you must ensure that there are proposals for financial and other incentives, including additional quota entitlements to encourage fishermen to move towards more selective and more environmentally friendly fishing gear.  I hope that you will agree with me, Commissioner, that in the current context that will be a small price to pay.
7723660 author: James Reid:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr  Neachtain, and the Committee on Fisheries for the constructive report on more environmentally friendly fishing methods and for the interest they have shown in the communication from the Commission. I cannot agree more with what the rapporteur has just said regarding the honesty and integrity of fishermen; the abuses of the few should not be blamed on everyone at large and we need to clamp down strongly on the real culprits.  The Commission attaches great importance to the development of more environmentally friendly fishing methods. Improving selectivity is one of the objectives of the technical measures that we propose in that context. In that regard, I am pleased to note that some progress has been achieved on the technical measures in the Baltic that were adopted by the Council in December, and the Commission intends to increase selectivity and the new technical measures to be proposed for the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic and North Sea.  I have noted your interest in combating ghost fishing. The Commission is prepared to be at the forefront of this battle. Following the Deepnet report, measures were decided, in the last TAC and in the quota regulation for  2006 , to ban temporarily deepwater gillnet fishery in the areas covered by the report and concerned by this activity until such time as permanent measures  also applicable to other areas, in lieu of a complete ban  are adopted, hopefully, during this year. I have also reserved funds to support retrieval surveys of ghost nets. The Commission will continue to follow these issues with particular attention.  The reduction of discards will be a major objective of the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. It needs to be underscored that, due to the variety of the catch composition and the level of discards in European Union waters, the regional aspects of the different fisheries will be taken into account. The various areas to be considered will correspond to the spheres of influence of the different RACs, thereby incorporating more easily the proposals made by those councils, a positive evaluation being made by the relevant RAC.  The Commission is encouraging the industry to engage in pilot programmes by making use of the RACs for this purpose. Two such pilot projects have already been carried out in France and Sweden. Further pilot projects, in full cooperation with the industry, will allow us to test on a casebycase basis possible measures to reduce discards effectively.  The Commission is also encouraging the development of efforts in fisheries management in the Kattegat in cooperation with Denmark, Sweden and Germany. This will hopefully lead to positive results later this year. This kind of management, among other objectives, is aimed at reducing or eliminating discards.  Bycatch reduction is linked to selectivity and discard issues and, at international level, the Commission has promoted a global approach for bycatch issues within the FAO. This could result in an international plan of action on bycatch reduction andor technical guidelines elaborated by the FAO.  Most of the measures to promote environmentally friendly fishing methods will be included in the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea. As you know, technical measures are considered as a complement to effort limitations, TACs and quotas, longterm management and recovery plans, and as part of the overall package of management measures.  I have noted your request to simplify the regulatory system and can inform you that these new technical measures will be a fundamental test case in the simplification programme led by the Commission. They are one of the principal points of the action plan on simplification.  Turning to the amendments: with regard to Amendment  1  on centralisation and comanagement, the Commission would like to see substantial RAC involvement in the elaboration of technical measures without, however, any change to the decisionmaking process. The Commission agrees with taking into account initiatives of RACs so as to improve fisheries management and can accept that point on condition that the positive effects of such measures are confirmed by scientific assessment. I would like to emphasise that we already have examples to illustrate that the Commission takes into account proposals from the RACs, such as the case of the French squaremeshed panel, the Swedish grid and the proposed new rule under which  for safety reasons  the cod line is to be placed as far as ten metres, instead of one metre, away from the meshes of the cod end when using an onboard pump system in pelagic fisheries.  It is premature to give a definitive reaction to Amendment  2 , since discussions on depleted fish stocks are still under way. They will hopefully be concluded by April. However, the draft proposal from the Commission already provides for socioeconomic compensation linked to recovery plans, and I can assure you that this topic will be given the necessary attention.
3655447 author: Frederic Cameron:  . Mr President, in the western Balkans the EU can really make a difference. This was discussed at the Foreign Ministers Gymnich meeting in Salzburg.  The region is at the crossroads and the EU will guide it down the peaceful and reformist path. We have seen many positive developments in recent years, but we should not be lulled into a false sense of security.  This year the remaining status issues, Kosovo and Montenegro, must be solved with patience and determination. We must also move the region beyond the era of war. We must thus clear the way for progress on issues that really matter to the citizens of the region: economic and social development and bringing the countries into the European mainstream.  How can we best encourage the countries to stick to an ambitious reform agenda? Most importantly, we must stick to our commitment that the countries can make progress towards the EU with membership as the ultimate goal, once they have managed to meet the rigorous accession criteria. Moreover, we must strive to make this perspective concrete and tangible, as the Commission has done in its recent communication. Let me mention a few examples of our concrete objectives and proposals.  Firstly, we should remove obstacles to trade, production and investment. The Commission, together with the stability pact and the countries concerned, is pursuing the creation of a regional free trade agreement, which would replace the existing patchwork of  31  bilateral free trade agreements. This may be attained through a simultaneous enlargement and modernisation of CEFTA, on which there will be a CEFTA summit meeting in April in Bucharest.  Secondly, we should Europeanise the next generation  or why not the current generation? That is why we have proposed increasing the mobility of researchers and students by increasing the number of scholarships provided for them.  Thirdly, we need to facilitate peopletopeople contacts. We shall put forward measures on visa facilitation, and I trust that the Member States will move them quickly forward through the Council, so that we can start negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission agreements. Let me underline the fact that the more the countries in the region can do to ensure border controls and document security, the easier it will be to convince the EU Member States to make progress on visa facilitation.  I am glad that the EUs Foreign Ministers in Salzburg last weekend endorsed these practical measures and, even though she is not present today, I want to pay particular tribute to Mrs Plassnik and her personal commitment to ensuring progress in the western Balkans.  Finally, I must say a few words about the death of Slobodan Milosevic. When we received the news of his death at the end of the Gymnich meeting, my immediate reaction was to remember my visit to Srebrenica last July, at the tenth commemoration of the most appalling massacre in postwar Europe. I regret that Milosevic died before justice could be served for the hundreds of thousands of victims of the crimes for which he was indicted.  In his memoirs, Chancellor Kohl writes that each generation must work for a necessary consciousness of history to avoid repeating our mistakes and to ensure that the voices of victims are heard. These are very wise words.  The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is putting on record evidence that will help the Serbs of current and future generations to understand that many crimes were committed in the name of Serbia, while certain individuals were responsible for these crimes.  The death of Milosevic makes it even more important for The Hague Tribunal to complete its work and for the remaining indictees to be transferred there. This will help Serbia to close the tragic chapter of history over which Milosevic presided and to come to terms with the legacy of its past.  Today Serbia is truly at the crossroads and I sincerely hope that the leaders and people of Serbia have the will and wisdom to choose the European future instead of the nationalist past. The country now truly holds its future in its own hands. We can help the Serbs to make the right choice by keeping the European prospect open for them.
7501889 author: Katarina MacLeod:  . Mr President, as he is still here, let me commend Mr Brok for his important report. As he rightly said, enlargement is indeed one of the EUs most powerful policy tools to pursue peace and prosperity, liberty and democracy. The eastern enlargement of  2004  sealed the peaceful reunification between Western and Eastern Europe. Now our energy is focused on a peaceful unification in southeast Europe. Our gradual and carefully managed accession process is based on three key principles.  First, we have consolidated our enlargement agenda. It means that we must be cautious before taking any new commitments, but likewise we must stick to our prevailing commitments towards candidate or potential candidate countries already in the process. Our consolidated enlargement agenda focuses on southeast Europe: Bulgaria and Romania, and Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans.  Secondly, we apply rigorous conditionality. Combined with a credible accession perspective, conditionality works. It has helped to transform Central and Eastern Europe into modern democracies. More recently, it has inspired bold and significant reforms in Turkey and increasingly in the western Balkans. This is also proven by some recent important events, as General Ante Gotovina is behind bars in The Hague, while the novelist Orhan Pamuk is free to express his opinions.  Enlargement policy and neighbourhood policy complement each other. Furthermore, the Commission is ready to deepen further and upgrade cooperation with our neighbourhood partners once the main priorities in the current action plans have been properly addressed.  At the same time, we should avoid the pitfalls of an overly theoretical debate on the final borders of Europe. As we now have a consolidated enlargement agenda, a theoretical discussion, for example about whether Ukraine should even join the European Union, would benefit neither us nor the Ukrainians, now that Ukraines future path and democratic development is at stake.  Certainly, the pace of enlargement must take into consideration the EUs absorption capacity. The Commission has always had this view. Enlargement is about sharing a project based on common principles, policies and institutions. The Union must ensure that it can maintain its capacity to act and decide according to a fair balance within its institutions, respecting budgetary limits and implementing common policies that function well and achieve their goals.  For over three decades, the EU has successfully absorbed a very diverse set of countries, as we can see from the composition of this House, for instance, including the President in the Chair in charge of this debate and the Commissioner involved. By developing its policies and institutions, the Union has responded positively to new circumstances, such as the fall of dictatorships, the collapse of communism and the rise of economic globalisation. Enlargement has proven to be a successful shock absorber for Europe.  Thirdly, we need better communication. The report rightly calls for a communication strategy and, indeed, broad public support is essential for everything the Union does, including enlargement. I rely on the political and financial support of Parliament to pursue a wellinformed debate on enlargement.  To conclude, consolidation was necessary to avoid overstretching on our enlargement commitments. But let us also keep in mind our own strategic interest: it would be utterly irresponsible to disrupt a valuable process that is helping to build stable and effective partners in the most unstable parts of Europe. If we were to go wobbly about the western Balkans European perspective, our beneficial influence, our political leverage, our impact would be seriously eroded, just when the region enters a difficult period of talks on Kosovos status.  The EU perspective is the key to a sustainable settlement for Kosovo and to democratic development in Serbia and the rest of the region. It is the foundation that keeps the region on a peaceful and reformist track. Therefore, for the sake of Europe, let us not shake this foundation, ensuring that the still fragile Balkans building does not collapse at our feet, in our own front yard!
5802493 author: Victor MacLeod:  . Mr President, I should like to begin by imparting to you some breaking news: the decisions of late  2005  have created a solid political framework for our enlargement policy for  2006  to  2010 , and in some cases even further. For instance, the accession negotiations with Turkey are likely to take  10  to  15  years. I do not expect anyone seriously to question our existing commitments in SouthEast Europe because it is really a matter of our own security and stability that we can enhance peace, democracy and increase prosperity in that very sensitive area.  We now have a consolidated and sufficiently demanding enlargement agenda. The enlargement train is no bullet train, no TGV, no Eurostar; it is a normal train or, in some cases, even a local train, but, most importantly, this train is moving, it is in the process and is thereby transforming the countries that are in the immediate neighbourhood of the European Union.  Concerning the borders of Europe, the Commission works on the basis of Article  49  of the Treaty on European Union, which states that any European country that respects and applies the European values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms may apply for membership of the Union. That does not mean that every European country must apply or that the EU must accept every country, but at the same time it means that it is not sensible to close the door forever by drawing a line across the map to define Europe once and for all, which would seriously damage our possibilities of having a beneficial influence and strategic leverage in our immediate neighbourhood.  Meanwhile, although no final borders of the Union have yet been determined, the EU is developing other forms of partnership and cooperation with our neighbouring countries, for instance in the form of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which can be further developed and upgraded.  A few comments and points have been made concerning absorption capacity. I would like to give a very brief historical overview. That concept was first explicitly mentioned in Copenhagen in  1993  when the European Council stated that the Unions capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interests of both the Union and the candidate countries. That concept and its consequences have been examined regularly by the Commission.  In its Agenda  2000   and I am happy to refer to that because I was a member of the Steering Group for Agenda  2000 , which was adopted in  1997   the Commission examined the impact of the accession of central and eastern European countries from two angles: its impact on EU policies such as agriculture or regional policy, and its budgetary consequences. As a result, this work led to the setting of critical parameters in the negotiations that followed, in the decisions of March  1999  at the Berlin Summit and in  2003 , when the countries of eastern and central Europe were allowed to join the European Union. This facilitated the accession of EU 10  and, by those means, we successfully combined our historic mission of reunifying the European continent and taking care of the practical considerations, which are also of concern to our citizens today.  Later on, we examined that concept during the accession negotiations, in some chapters in particular, such as that on the free movement of persons and the financial chapters, and more recently the Commission also examined that concept in our  2004  Issues Paper on questions arising from the Turkish accession perspective.  I would recommend this paper of October  2004  to all Members of the European Parliament. It is still worth reading and outlines very well the broad consequences of possible Turkish accession to the Union if, one day, Turkey meets all the conditions for accession.  Thus, the upsurge in capacity is an important concept, and it has also been referred to in the negotiating frameworks for Turkey and Croatia. I can assure you that we bear this in mind throughout the negotiations, and it is also a leading concept in our strategy document of last November. We base our work on that concept and it is a very important consideration.  Finally, referring to what Mr Eurlings said about deepening and widening, I belong to the camp that thinks that the deepening of political integration is indispensable in order to make the European Union more effective and democratic. We must make the Union function better, and that was and is the purpose of the Constitutional Treaty. Therefore, we need a constitutional debate and, in time  sooner rather than later  we need to decide on how we reform our structures so that they are more effective and democratic and so that the European Union can have more clout in external relations, in Common Foreign and Security Policy and in preserving the security of its own citizens against international crime and terrorism.  That must be done in the near future, not in the distant future  not in  10  to  15  years, for instance, when Turkey might be able to join  for the sake of Europe, and we need it already for the European Union of  25  or  27  Member States. Therefore, rather than talk about absorption capacity, I would prefer to talk about the functioning capacity of the current European Union to ensure that we serve our citizens better in terms of both policies and institutions.
6072352 author: Philip Brown:  . Mr President, I am grateful for the initiative of the Austrian Presidency in organising, together with the forthcoming Finnish Presidency, a very important day in June: Competition Day. With regard to other matters, I am impressed by the priority that has been given to the SMEs. The issue has been approached in a way that really represents a great step forward. The Presidency has not only fulfilled an agenda, but has also been very pragmatic in trying to find solutions. We are aware that it is not only Members of Parliament who are interested in the issue but others too, especially the SMEs themselves.  I am very grateful to all the Members who, in their remarks, gave quite clear backing to the policy of the Commission. I also take into account that not everybody agrees on the policy. However, I sincerely hope that we are all aware that open and competitive markets are key drivers for growth and jobs in Europe. It was rightly mentioned that this is what we promised to deliver in the Lisbon Agenda: more jobs, better jobs and economic growth.  As many of you have recognised, an internal market has enormous potential. We have to let our businesses and industries exploit it to the full. That is what was decided. It includes, by the way, the process of corporate restructuring. That is looking promising and it is not only a matter of looking at the internal market itself, but also of looking at the position of the internal market outside Europe. For we have to be aware that there is a global competitiveness and if we are serious in saying that we want to play that game then we need to be aware that we have to restructure in some circumstances.  While the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a casebycase basis in accordance  there is no doubt about this  with the relevant competition rules, mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition. This in turn leads to concrete benefits for European consumers in the form of lower prices and wider choice, and that is why the Commission would look with great concern at any unjustified interference in this process by national governments.  As regards the free movement of capital rightly mentioned by a number of Members, the Commission will uphold the single market rules, as you expect us to do. We will be tough against Member States which fail to implement correctly the provisions of the EC sectoral legislation introducing competition into markets such as energy, telecoms, financial services or banking. As regards individual mergers, we will enforce the Merger Regulation in a fair, objective and coherent way. You will recall that under the Merger Regulation the Commission has exclusive competence for controlling, on competition grounds, the effects of mergers with a Community dimension.  I take careful note of the concerns expressed here about specific cases in the energy sector. I have no information at this point so I cannot discuss them. I say once again that we control mergers on competition grounds only, and that is the basis on which the Court reviews our decisions. As you know, Article 21  of the Merger Regulation also gives us a tool for addressing any undue interference by national authorities in relation to corporate restructuring. I would add that I will not hesitate to use this tool wherever it is necessary.  Regarding the twothirds rule for mergers touched upon by some Members, will that rule for mergers be amended? The split of competences due to the twothirds rule may lead to inconsistency in the approach to substantially similar mergers. That is basic. I think this seems particularly inappropriate in the energy sector, where an EUwide policy on liberalisation is currently being implemented  it is not ready yet but it is currently being implemented  and where different players should be treated in a similar way across Member States. So, no different treatment in one Member State than in another.  However, the Commission is at a very early stage of its thought process. The first step is a consultation with stakeholders in the Member States on the question of whether it is advisable to modify the twothirds rule. I am aware that we need the backing of the Council and I am aware how difficult that will be. That is a possible instrument and I am in favour of tackling it, but that is not my goal. The goal is to ensure fair and equal treatment, rather than one being more equal than another. So, if there is a possibility of arriving at that policy, from whatever direction, then it will be Dday for this part of my policy.  The Commission has a duty to enforce the rules wherever appropriate. As guardian of the Treaties we will do our job fairly but firmly, as was rightly said by the Austrian Presidency.  I thank you again for your support; I am grateful for it. We badly need to do our job as quickly as possible, for it is indeed quite hectic in merger country.
4563063 author: Alastair MacLeod:  . Mr President, we are here to discuss the Barcelona Process and the preparations for the next meeting of the EuroMediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.  Let me just say a few words about the recent events in the Palestinian territories, because today the time was so short during the speeches on the Gymnich and there were only two Commissioners. I ceded my place to Commissioner Rehn for the Western Balkans debate and now, if you permit me, I shall say a few words on yesterdays events. It is not only topical but also goes to the heart of the EuroMediterranean partnership, to our shared objective for a region of peace, stability, prosperity and opportunity. I fail to see how any of the actions yesterday in any way contributed to those objectives.  The Israeli attack on the prison in Jericho and the Israelis public treatment of prison guards and inmates is unacceptable and should be condemned. I also deplore the violence, the kidnappings and the attacks on the Commission offices and other offices of the Member States in Gaza and the West Bank.  The first victims of this breakdown of law and order are the Palestinian people themselves. In the current circumstances, with key political deadlines ahead in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, it is more important than ever that both parties show restraint and responsibility. Attacks, such as the ones that took place yesterday, and provocative statements do nothing to improve prospects, and the Palestinian Authority must put an end to violence and insecurity. Yesterday evening, I had a good discussion  as you, Mr President, no doubt did  with President Abbas before he returned to deal with the mounting violence and confrontation. He is doing one of the most difficult jobs in the world just now, which was not made any easier by yesterdays events. How he manages to compose a new Palestinian Authority Government will affect the prospects for peace in the Middle East and will also have repercussions for us all.  The European Union is a reliable partner of the Palestinian people. No donor has done more to help them. I told President Abbas once again that we want to continue our support for a better, peaceful and prosperous future, but that we stand firm on our principles, leaving the door open to positive developments. All future assistance to a new Palestinian Authority Government will be reviewed in relation to its position on the key principles of an end to violence, recognition of Israel and compliance with the existing agreements, including the Roadmap. Those with whom President Abbas negotiates must know and understand that their decisions on their issues will have important repercussions.  Let me now say a few words about the EuroMed Partnership. The Barcelona Summit last November achieved notable results for the future. The fiveyear work programme agreed at the summit and the Code of Conduct on counterterrorism constitute a very ambitious agenda which will render the partnership more tangible, more politically relevant and more operational.  To follow up on the summit, we must now ensure constructive and effective contributions by all partners to attain the commonly agreed objectives on political and economic reform, growth and job creation, human rights and gender issues, education and management of migration, regional stability and the fight against terrorism.  The Commission has already launched work on the implementation of that fiveyear programme. Initiatives have been taken with the current and the incoming Council Presidencies, as well as with Mediterranean partners, to ensure the success of this common endeavour. We have reserved appropriate funding for assistance and support, provided through MEDA and the future European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, including a substantial facility to encourage progress on governance reform that we call a governance facility.  As of this year, several new and innovative activities will be launched. Preparations are well under way to organise the first EuroMed ministerial meeting on gender issues at the end of the year.  Two subregional conferences, one in the Maghreb and one in the Mashreq, will pave the way for government and civil society representatives to examine the importance of gender equality for economic and social development and propose practical measures to improve womens access to jobs and public life.  At the Barcelona Summit, EuroMed partners highlighted the importance of migration, social integration, justice and security as issues of common interest in the partnership, which should be addressed through a balanced and comprehensive approach. Work has begun on preparing a ministerial meeting to tackle all issues from illegal migration to trafficking in human beings and people smuggling.  This regional initiative is complemented by our bilateral programmes aimed at strengthening institutional capacities, managing legal migration, improving border controls, fighting illegal immigration and people trafficking.  Mr Winkler has already mentioned the Trade Ministerial Meeting, which will be attended by Commissioner Mandelson and will advance the objective of a European free trade area.  We also hope to see similar progress on SouthSouth trade  the Agadir process. The socalled cartoon crisis has highlighted the dangers of leaving prejudice, misinformation and misunderstanding to fester. We regret the offence caused by those cartoons to Muslims across the world, but we also strongly condemned all violent acts and threats against individuals and property of the European Union and other countries. Support for intercultural dialogue at all levels is important. I am glad that in Salzburg this has been very strongly recommended. We are convinced that the Barcelona Process has a framework for it and that the architecture is already there: there is the Anna Lindh Foundation and  35  other structures within an entire network.  We must reach out to civil society and the media, and all the media seminars that are being planned by the Austrian Presidency are very welcome.  In this context, I am very happy with the initiative to exchange views on this subject during the next EuroMed Parliamentary Assembly. From there, I would go to the Arab League summit in Khartoum, because it is highly important that we now use every opportunity to really talk to our Arab friends and colleagues.  At this critical juncture, our message has to be clear: it is through a vigorous but also peaceful dialogue of opinions, with full respect for freedom of expression, that understanding can be deepened and respect can be built. Indeed, that is the essence of the Barcelona Process. Therefore, what we want to do is give more hope to progress. Together, we want to realise the objectives of security, stability and prosperity.
6223551 author: James MacLeod:  . Mr President, the rapporteur has received flowers from quite a number of honourable Members and, on behalf of the Commission, I should like to add a couple of flowers to the bouquet. Thank you again for the interesting exchange of views. Let me comment on some of the points raised during this debate.  As a general comment  Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Castiglione touched upon this point  I should like to stress again that with these proposals the Commission wants to bring our legislation into conformity with the findings of the WTO panels. This includes numerous aspects of the procedure and elements of simplification, so the system can support the implementation of the WTO findings. That was a point mentioned by MrAllister and, in my opinion, it addresses his concerns.  In response to Mr Mulder, I reiterate the intention of the Commission to further review the various policy issues not related to the WTO findings and the wider issue of the agricultural quality policy in the EC over the next year. I have learnt a lot this evening, including the point Mr Mulder made about Edam cheese. I should explain to Mr Mulder that Edam is a type of cheese that can be produced anywhere. It is a Codex standard. However, North Holland Edam is protected, and that is a Dutch quality product. So eat more Edam from North Holland!  Let me comment in more detail on the exchange of views and address some of the issues you have raised. Concerning the logos, the three logos established by Commission rules are already different from one another. I also want to make it clear that any advantage given to EC producers  and I believe the use of a Community symbol is such an advantage  will be equally open to third country producers. That answer is for Mr Castiglione and Mrs Herranz Garca. However, the Commission agrees that this needs to be further explored. This will be done within the framework of the wider policy review, which the Commission intends to conduct as soon as this proposal has been implemented.  Several amendments deal with the obligations of the Member States and the Commission, which Mr Podkaski mentioned. The Commission has no intention of altering the current distribution of competence between the Member States and the Commission.  Amendments  23  and  24  ask for a time period for the Commission to scrutinise and publish applications. I agree that the Commission should carry out its duties within a reasonable period of time. Mrs Lulling and MrsSalinas Garca touched upon that. I agree that we should take into account the definition of a reasonable period of time, which is not easy, given the complexity of applications. It is certainly not realistic to have all the applications scrutinised and published in six months; twelve months would be more acceptable.  Your amendments on controls reflect the aim of the Commission proposal, which is to ensure that there is a clear understanding that all over the EC there are authorities in charge of enforcing the Community rules on geographical indications and traditional specialities. There is also no doubt that these controls will be carried out within the framework of Regulation (EC) No 8822004  on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law.  There are points that concern only the geographical indications report that I want to mention. These are the use of ingredients in processed products and the origin of raw materials. I confirm that your proposals concerning the use of protected names in relation to ingredients for processed products meet some of the Commissions concerns. However, the general rules on labelling already cover cases of misleading information. Further restrictions on the use of registered names for processed products would mean a major policy change that deserves to be adequately and thoroughly assessed.  I took note of various amendments concerning the labelling of origin or other conditions applicable to raw materials. The Commission shares Mr Graefe zu Baringdorfs objective that people should not be misled in this respect. However, we have to be very prudent. Any policy change in this field may affect rights already granted to users of certain designations.  Finally, I shall make a few points on the TSG report. The current regulation on traditional specialities guaranteed has no definition for the term traditional. We propose to introduce the obligation to prove usage for a time period of at least  25  years. We believe that this is a good compromise.  As a result, the Commission can in principle accept the following amendments in the report on geographical indications: Amendments  1 ,  10 ,  11 ,  15 ,  25 ,  29  and  31 . Of the lastminute amendments tabled for this partsession, the Commission can in principle accept Amendments  41 ,  43 ,  49  and  54 . In the report on traditional specialities, it can accept Amendments  6 ,  10 ,  13  and  16 . The Commission cannot accept the other amendments to these reports.
4281387 author: Christoph LaCourt:  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate. I will make a few brief comments.  First of all, on the issue of the agencies, I totally agree that both the ECDC and EISS are very important policies, but they should not be at the cost of the other health policies. Unless we have increased financing, we will be faced with the impossible choice of either funding fully the two agencies and doing absolutely nothing else, or splitting the money, which I am not sure would be of benefit either. That is an important issue.  With regard to funding, I should like to thank the Members for their support. Given the way that we work in the Union in the area of health, which involves mostly nonlegislative initiatives, more money is required. When you legislate, it is much easier to send the proposals that have been adopted and expect Member States to implement them. But when you want to take other initiatives of coordination, of recommendations, or of exchange of best practices, then you need more money. I agree that we will not expand into the competence of the Member States. We will emphasise and target areas where we can have European added value by taking action at European level. That is in fact what the programme is doing.  Health services fall within the competence of Member States. There is no question about that. But in a Union of solidarity, I do not believe we can accept the health inequalities that exist today in the European Union, where we have a life expectancy variation of more than ten years from one Member State to the other.  Patient mobility is an important issue. It is a reality that we have to deal with. We will produce proposals in that respect. But the target should be that patients be offered a high level of treatment where they live, where their families are, where they speak the language. That can be achieved through programmes of centres of reference, exchange of best practices, coordinating Member States, coordinating healthcare systems and working together and achieving the highest level of service. I repeat: that would not interfere with the issues of competence and subsidiarity.  We are working not only with blockbusting medicine; on the contrary, I would like to remind you that there is provision in the programme for rare diseases, which is also followed by orphan drugs. We are promoting that area as well.  As regards tobacco, I could not agree more, and I would be very happy if we ever have the opportunity to have a specific debate on the tobacco area. The issue of subsidies is correct, but I would also like to add that subsidies will eventually be phased out and that is a decision which has already been taken, but the tobacco fund that we financed in Europeanlevel campaigns gets money through those subsidies. Once the subsidies finish, we will have no more money left for Europewide campaigns on tobacco, so that, again, is an impossible situation and I hope we 1 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 24 , 26 and 29 . There are a number of recommendations, notably paragraphs 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 22 , 23 and 30 , which are addressed also to the Member States, and the Commission will discuss these specific proposals with the Member States when we elaborate further on the action plan. The Commission has also taken good note of recommendation 9 , and we will look into it: coordination is certainly an issue to be addressed. Finally, there are a number of recommendations, such as 2 , 13 , 15 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 30 and 32 come up with a solution in the near future.  As regards alcohol, I would like to remind you that by the end of this year, or some time after the summer, we will produce the Community strategy proposal for a European strategy on alcohol. I have noted the comments made about pesticides.  On financing, I would like to address MrsDoyle: I raise an accounting error  or, at least, I hope it is an accounting error  because I cannot really believe that it was intentionally decided to reduce the funding of health and consumer protection. I hope in the overall arrangement that somebody noticed the impact that compromise would have on those two specific areas, which means it can be corrected. If it was intentional, then I very much regret that and I cannot say much more than that.  On the issue of complementary medicine, I have noted the comments made. We feel that this is more of an area of subsidiarity. The Commission proposal does not deal with specific medicine as such.  Regarding environment and health  I am addressing MrsRies  we already have measures under the current programme and they will continue under a new programme especially as regards environmental determinants on health.  Coming to the various diseases, I can assure you that cancer is our priority among other diseases, but we have included a new strand which provides for the reduction of disease burden, but we believed that in a sevenyear programme we needed more flexibility, so we do not list specific diseases; however, that can be done through different decisions that can be taken in the course of the programme. By listing some diseases, you effectively exclude others, so we wanted a more flexible approach on this.  I would also like to remind the Members that I will be bringing forward a proposal on the health strategy, which will be more detailed and will elaborate on the programme based on the funding that we will eventually obtain; so there will be a fullyfledged, broader strategy and that will be done together with the stakeholders and citizens.  In conclusion, I would like once again to thank MrTrakatellis for the excellent job he has done, as well as the members of the committee. I thank you again for your support in this very important policy area.
2514593 author: Roger LaCourt:  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I should like to confirm explicitly what was, in actual fact, already obvious from the previous debate. The Committee is opposed to an integrated public health and consumer protection programme, and with the backing of the Conference of Presidents, we are asking for a separate multiannual programme for consumer protection. Since the Commissioner does not strike me as entirely convinced, here are the reasons again in a nutshell.  The Community competences in each of these two areas are too dissimilar from one another. This is also true of the social objectives of the civilsociety organisations involved; internal distribution of competences, also in the Member States, is often at odds with an integrated approach. A patient is slightly different from a consumer and at the very least, we would like certainty in relation to the proportion of the budget that is available for consumer affairs and we want to prevent a situation, when we are faced with a public health crisis, where consumer policy would be the budgetary victim of an urgent public health need which should normally be resolved by means of a flexibility instrument.  If the truth be known, I feel, given the lack of financial perspectives, a little uneasy talking about this report today, because we have no idea as to the level of budget. At the same time, I am acutely aware that the extent of the budget and the fleshing out of the programme in terms of content are two sides of the same coin. It is difficult, though, to restrain our ambitions in the area of consumer policy. For years, all European institutions have used Community consumer policy to illustrate that Europe is very much concerned about the care of normal people. In times of enlargement, when the need to give the internal market a consumer dimension is greater than ever, when we also need to let the European Union keep its human face, in times like these, we cannot curb the ambitions in the area of consumer protection without this having any repercussions.  Since the three institutions are present today  and I assume that the Austrian Presidency is adequately represented  it is for that reason alone that I consider it useful today to argue in favour of keeping the budget as specified in the Commission proposal. I think we should really stick to it.  In consultation with Mr Trakatellis of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have carefully carved up the budget according to the scale of apportionment used by the Commission. Accordingly, for consumer protection, we arrive at a sum of EUR  233  million spread over seven years. In agreement with our financial perspectives negotiator, MrBge, we did not add anything in IMCO, but let us not misunderstand each other: this does not mean in any way that we will be satisfied with less at a later stage. The three budgetary authorities are asked to take this message literally. We are not satisfied with less, given the importance of the subject matter, the increased sphere of action resulting from enlargement, and the consumers vital confidence in the internal market.  I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, because they are right behind us on this, and also because we managed to confine ourselves to two major additional areas of concern at the Commissions proposal which, incidentally, the Commissioner did an extremely good job of explaining.   1 . We want the proramming procedure to be more open to involving the Member States that do not have a long tradition of consumer protection, consumer movement, the capacity development of consumer associations and their participation in policy preparation.   2 . Special attention should go to the phenomenon of ageing among the population and also to other vulnerable consumer groups. People knowledgeable in the area of consumer law know that we cannot adequately provide for these vulnerable groups in legislation, which, by definition, has a general scope, but in a consumer programme, we can focus on target groups and we can accommodate this vulnerable consumer, and that is what we must do if we want to move towards a warm and human society.  This is the first report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in more than ten years in which its late chairman, Mr Whitehead, has not taken the floor. We still miss him, and years of warm and friendly cooperation with him have led me to dedicate this report to him. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask your support for all of this, I also ask the Commission and the Council to support our proposal. I thank you for the cooperation, I thank you for your respect for MrWhitehead, for we owe this to him, and I am also indebted to the people of the Committees Secretariat who have plotted the course of this dossier very professionally.  Mr President, allow me say a few words by way of conclusion. It is unlikely that all Members will have a chance to talk before lunch; as such, we will need to reach an agreement on the vote, because this is not a codecision report. If not everyone speaks before lunch, I would suggest moving the vote to next weeks partsession in Brussels, for I think that we cannot let coincidences determine the outcome of this, and that we cannot vote on a topic of this kind with a very small number of people present. That is my suggestion as rapporteur.
2851518 author: Helen LaCourt:  . Mr President, I shall briefly make a few comments on the issues raised by the Members. I would like to thank them for the very interesting debate we had, and now we have the advantage of having them split into two parts, but I still think the issues raised here today were very interesting.  I know I tend to repeat myself, but many of the issues raised will face financial challenges; so issues such as support for consumer organisations or increased support for consumer organisations, or even more activestrengthened initiatives in the new Member States will be affected by the final outcome of the budget discussions. Nevertheless, especially on the issue of the new Member States, I agree that there is a need for priority, not so much having a separate strategy  and this has already been described in the morning session  but rather giving priority and emphasis and focusing on the newest Member States, at least those where the consumer protection tradition is less apparent than in other Member States. These will be reflected, as you will see in the near future, in the consumer strategy which is being drawn up in a more detailed way, and you will see how the focus will be concentrated on the new Member States, especially in education, in the training of consumer organisations and in areas where we could strengthen consumer protection mentality.  On the issue of vulnerable groups, I agree that certain consumer groups need increased protection. Again, I am not sure if inclusion or specific provision in the programme is the best way to achieve this; nevertheless, in specific actions, in specific initiatives and legislation, we should take into account the particular needs of vulnerable groups, children for example. I refer you to the relatively recent legislation we have adopted jointly on unfair commercial practices, where we take into account vulnerable consumer groups.  There is a misunderstanding about the agency. I see that MrStubb is not here this afternoon, but the proposal for an agency is not in the sense 100 pairs bought by European consumers; in other words, a fraction of the product range. A duty would be just over EUR 1 . 50 on average wholesale prices of EUR 8 . 50 on shoes which then sell for between EUR 40 and EUR 120 , as opposed to a duty which would simply amount to EUR 1 . 50 . Please do not tell me that EUR 1 . 50 of an agency that will be formulating policy or taking initiatives in the area of consumer protection; it will be an executive agency, it will be a management body which will do the accounting and all the practical aspects that do not involve policy. It will actually operate from the practical accounting management aspect, so it will free the resources we have in the Commission actually to promote and propose policies. We already have an executive agency for the health programme, and this is something that has been working very well because it makes better use of resources, and we propose something similar now for consumer protection. So, it is not a separate agency or institution in the sense that it was described today by the speaker of the group concerned.  I said a few things about splitting this morning. I understand Parliaments position. Before we take our final decision, we will wait to see the outcome of the discussion on the financial perspectives, so at this point we do not agree: we still feel that there are benefits in having a joint programme whilst safeguarding the specific needs and financing provisions of the two areas. Nevertheless, we will revisit this issue once we have a specific picture in front of us regarding the budget.  Finally, I have taken the point on services on board. We are already funding programmes for consumers in relation to services as well. One point on the consumer protection area in general is that we should always bear in mind the benefits of offering consumer protection, not just for the consumers, not just for the protection of the citizen, but also the benefits that increased consumer confidence will have on the internal market, the economic growth that this will promote and, of course, the competitiveness of the European economy.  Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the committee for their strong support of this programme, and I am looking forward to working with them in the consumer protection area in the following period.
3425787 author: Michael McNabb:  . Mr President, let me first answer a few of the political questions, then also say a word about Belarus. I will also be very happy to respond to MrsSchroedter before talking about the real substance of todays debate: human rights.  First, on the political issue, Moldova is a country in the European Neighbourhood Policy and we are trying, through that policy, to bring Moldova closer to the European Union and  I point this out to Mr Posselt  slowly democratise it, although a lot still has to be done. However, this is the way forward. For that purpose, it is also very important to cut the illegal trafficking of goods, people, arms, perhaps also drugs, and to cut criminal activities.  I thank all those who have mentioned a border mission. The European Union has introduced a border mission very recently in Transnistria, between Moldova and Ukraine. We have to thank Ukrainian President Yushchenko who, when he came to power, really started this initiative and has taken it up together with President Voronin. With my colleagues the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Moldova, we have succeeded in putting this in place. I think it works quite well, by the way, under a Hungarian leader in this region. Its real objective, in my view, is to cut illegal trafficking. That is not always easy, but in the long run it will reach its goal.  You all spoke about the Transnistrian conflict and how we can resolve it. Indeed, the OSCE has been trying to do everything to help and the European Union is more and more involved too. By the way, we have achieved some progress because the Russians did in fact accept the five plus two talks to which we, the European Union, together with the United States of America, have been invited as observers in order to find a settlement.  It is true that Russian troops have not yet been withdrawn, as had been foreseen at the OSCE in Istanbul, and this still has to take place. Of course, the question is, what will replace them? First, all things political have to continue, although, unfortunately as someone said, Transnistria did in fact walk out of the talks before. Therefore, a lot still remains to be done.  Now I come to Belarus and, with your permission, I will continue in German.  Mrs Schroedter, I believe to begin with I was completely misinterpreted here. The journalist who was sitting in our room at the press conference in Brussels asked me as Commissioner whether we as the European Commission were sending an EU election observation mission to Belarus. I said: No, the observation is being done by the OSCEODIHR. You know that is the case. I then added that the parliamentarians were not part of an official EU mission, because we do not have one. That was completely misinterpreted. Please accept that again as my explanation. I am glad you raised the matter because it has allowed me to clear it up.  I not only wrote a letter to Mr Klich yesterday, I also spoke to him; he understood completely. I have also already issued a statement today on Belarus, where I am of course following events in the runup to the elections, in which I also said how much I regret that the parliamentarians were denied admission by refusing them visas; they are of course always welcome here, that goes without saying and you ought to know that, since I am so much in favour of EU observer missions and am doing something for them to actually strengthen them.  I am coming to my third point, which concerns todays debate on the resolutions on breaches of human rights in Moldova.  The motion for a resolution draws attention to the failures of the judicial system to secure fair trials. I should note that in  2005  Moldova adopted three laws which significantly strengthened the independence of the judiciary. So far as the Pasat case  the case of the former Defence Minister  is concerned, the Commission has raised the problems surrounding this case several times. I am in direct contact with MrStratan, the Moldovan Foreign Minister. I have just written a letter to President Voronin on this issue, in order to have transparency and not to delay Mr Pasats appeal.  Democracy, the rule of law and human rights will feature very prominently at the forthcoming Cooperation Council meeting with Moldova.  Todays debate puts special emphasis on human rights in Transnistria. However, as you all know, because of its status as a selfproclaimed independent republic, we have only limited insight concerning developments in Transnistria. However, it is clear that there are very significant problems. In summer  2004 , for instance, the Transnistrian authorities forcibly closed six schools that taught the Moldovan language using the Latin script. We are pleased to see that negotiations between Moldovan and Transnistrian officials on the issue of these Latinscript schools restarted in February after a hiatus of seven months. The Commission will follow the development of these negotiations very carefully.  Let me say a few words about the Ilascu case, which remains a very serious example of the violation of human rights. Since Moldova is unable to intervene in Transnistria, we raise the issue with Russia whenever the opportunity arises. The last occasion was about two weeks ago in Vienna at the Troika of Foreign Ministers, when I met Foreign Minister Lavrov. The recent reports that Andrei Ivantoc, one of the two prisoners, has begun a hunger strike underline the need for the immediate release of both prisoners. We have to apply pressure to make that happen.  The Commission is working with all the partner countries, including Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, in order to achieve a withdrawal of the Russian troops, the demilitarisation of Transnistria, the democratisation of Moldova  including Transnistria  and the establishment of effective and legal control of Transnistria by Moldova proper.
1354878 author: Alastair Brown:  . Mr President, there is much to say about Kazakhstan. On the one hand, Kazakhstan is and should be a key partner for promoting stability and regional cooperation in Central Asia. Indeed, it is the most important of these countries and it is also rich in energy supplies and therefore it is being courted by many countries today.  Let us analyse President Nazarbayevs State of the Nation address on  1 March. It was very comprehensive on economic development. However, it was not very detailed on the programme of democratic reforms, despite promises of a programme of democratic changes and promises to the international community. The concept of managed democracy was reconfirmed; in fact, it was reinforced.  Let me say a few words about the positive side and the negative side, because we have to see both sides. On a positive note, I would like to welcome Kazakhstans ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in January this year. This is a good step. We also hope that Kazakhstan will now take steps to ratify the optional protocols allowing individual complaints. The continuing moratorium on the death penalty is also a step in the right direction.  On the negative side, and as regards issues we should criticise, what has happened to the leading political opposition leader Mr Sarsenbayev is of the utmost concern to us. His murder points towards a very dangerous trend of criminalisation in Kazakh politics. In the absence of clear constitutional mechanisms guaranteeing a peaceful transfer of executive power in Kazakhstan, this development is clearly worrying. We have therefore urged the authorities to ensure complete transparency in the investigation process. I am pleased that the FBI can go there, but some Europeans should be there as well. We are also following very closely the investigation into the murder of Oksana Nikitina, the daughter of another prominent member of the opposition. I have also been very troubled by reports on harassment of opposition figures following two peaceful memorial marches in Almaty, held after Mr Sarsenbayevs funeral. Some of you have alluded to that.  I would also like to mention the two essential issues of media freedom and restrictions on civil society. We are concerned at reports of numerous instances of harassment of journalists and actions taken against five newspapers and one opposition website. The new law on national security, adopted in July  2005 , also permits undue restrictions on civil society and NGO activities.  We have welcomed, on the one hand, improvements noted by the OSCEODIHR in the administration of the December  2005  presidential election  a few of you were there to observe them. However, we also regret that the election did not meet a number of OSCE commitments and that no action was taken to amend the legislative framework in line with OSCEODIHR recommendations. We will certainly want to continue to monitor the investigations about alleged malpractices.  One lingering core concern is political freedom. For the sake of its internal stability, Kazakhstan needs a political opposition and it is urgent for the authorities to legalise political opposition parties and open a real dialogue with them, for example through the state commission on democratisation, which is to be established soon and chaired by President Nazarbayev. In particular I think that the Kazakh authorities will reconsider their refusal to register the opposition political parties Alga and True Ak Zhol.  I would very much welcome it if you form a parliamentary delegation and if you reinforce your cooperation with delegations from Kazakhstan. It is another very important channel to give them clear messages and it is also an opportunity. Let us not prejudge a decision on Kazakhstans bid for the chairmanship of the OSCE in  2009 . Perhaps it might provide Kazakhstan with an important challenge in achieving higher standards of democracy.  Finally, we are also concerned about reports of numerous instances of harassment of journalists and actions taken against five newspapers and one opposition website. The new law on national security that was adopted in July last year also permits undue restrictions on civil society and NGO activities. I think therefore that this is a country with which we have to engage very strongly but at the same time we have to deliver firm messages.
2572456 author: Marc Reid:  . Mr President, the previous debate on the Commissions work programme focused a lot on energy. I am very grateful for this and for the question that was put to the Commission and made this debate possible.  In a way, the Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy has given the answers as to how we should proceed in addressing the challenges set out in your question. We should also realise that this is a global challenge: the tightness of supply and demand, climate change, import dependency and investment needs in the energy sector are all global challenges. The response from the European Union is a common energy policy. We have significant support from citizens. In a recent opinion poll,  47  of European citizens supported action at European level. We received a lot of support from many Member States and national parliaments after the publication of the Green Paper. It is clear that the main added value of this Green Paper lies in this common approach where we stress that security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability cannot be separated in our energy policy. All three should interact.  At the same time, it is also clear that we cannot find a silver bullet and there is no silver bullet. It means that in the area of energy policy we should focus on a set of measures in specific areas. Firstly, it is important for security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness to provide a really competitive, open, transparent EU internal market. That is also crucial for security of supply. We provide for some actions that really provide for not only stronger competition but also crossborder trade: crossborder energy transactions. This is an extremely important area and I expect support from this House in the future on these issues.  The second issue, which is extremely important  as the PresidentinOffice indicated  is solidarity. The Union is strong when there is solidarity. Solidarity means, firstly, being ready for extreme situations; secondly, it involves the solidarity mechanism and, thirdly, it involves a lot of information on what is happening on the energy markets. I agree that diversity is the most important issue, but to use this diversity in the best possible way we need a lot of information and a lot of transparency. We provide for such measures by revisiting the oil stocks directive, placing more focus on the security of supply of electricity and gas and looking for new mechanisms that really correspond to the needs of our citizens, who would like to know that should an extreme situation arise, we have a mechanism and reserves in place that could be used in such a situation.  Then there is the issue of the energy mix. That should be the responsibility of each Member State  it is a question of subsidiarity. However, we know that action in one particular Member State influences all the other Member States, at least the neighbouring Member States. That means that we should take action taking into account our neighbours energy policies and try to boost the best possible actions.  A strategic EU energy review, which would allow us to revisit these issues continually, is necessary to provide the best approach in terms of each states energy mix. Energy efficiency and renewable energy development will definitely be on the rise in deciding an energy mix. However, at the same time, I also believe that the nuclear energy that is now in the energy mix will be used in many Member States. It is important, however, to ensure that this energy is used in a safe and sustainable way.  I also believe in the diversity that could bring us new technologies and in clean coal, carbon sequestration and so on. We now have a good example with the Shell and Statoil project involving carbon sequestration and postcombustion. This is not a demonstration project: for the first time, a real industrial project involving  860 megawatts is bringing new possibilities for a diversification in the energy mix that corresponds to the objectives of our energy policy.  Some people have indicated that there is not enough focus on energy efficiency. I disagree, as there is a lot of emphasis on it. Parliament has debated the Green Paper on energy efficiency. We will propose a very ambitious European action plan on energy efficiency, which will place a lot of emphasis on transport. However, the focus on energy efficiency will be continued in all Member States through their national action plans and this is extremely important.  Regarding technology, I mention just one example: Europe is able to provide for new technologies, but we should use all the possibilities in a coherent way. I believe that the European strategic energy technology plan really could make a difference.  Last, but not least, the areas I should like to bring to your attention are international. The best response for security of supply is not only diversity, but also lies in global, transparent and competitive gas and oil markets. This is the vision that could provide the necessary diversity. For this to happen, we need to stabilise the countries that have gas and oil resources. We should build infrastructure that allows us to bring more gas from different regions in the world, because only in this way can we provide security of supply in gas and oil. We should promote our vision of the market to the near neighbourhood. The energy community should be expanded.  Tomorrow, the European Council will have the opportunity to debate these issues. I believe that the momentum created by the Green Paper for establishing a European common policy in energy will be continued. I am very grateful for the debate and I look forward to working with this House towards establishing a European energy policy that corresponds to the basic needs of our citizens.
3334882 author: Christoph Smith:  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Council for being here for this very important debate in relation to the European Development Fund. As the Council is aware, because of the ongoing debate on the budgetisation of the EDF, no provisions relating to the financial framework were included in the revised Cotonou agreement. However, in Annex  1  it states very clearly that the European Union will maintain its aid efforts at at least the same level as that of the ninth EDF.  Therefore, in my view, PresidentinOffice, the ACP countries were misled into believing that they should feel secure about future funding under the tenth EDF. The Commissions assessment was that for the tenth EDF, EUR 24 . 948 billion was the appropriate sum. In December, however, the Council in Brussels agreed on EUR 22 . 682  billion on current prices for the  20082013  period.  PresidentinOffice, I give this history because I think it is relevant to the position adopted by Parliaments Committee on Development, which is that the Development Committee requires reassurance and clarification before we agree to give our assent to the amended Cotonou agreement.  Past agreements should dictate that both the Council and the Commission should understand that when the Development Committee takes a strong stance, as we have done on the DCCI, we in that committee will maintain a very strong position on our principles. Our principles centre around development, and if they are not addressed, then the Council should understand that we will not give our assent until that is clearly part of the way in which you are operating.  One of our concerns relates to the fact that certain members of the Council say that we should accept that we deduct EUR 0 . 3  billion for the EUs  21  overseas countries and territories and that a further EUR 0 . 9  billion should be deducted to cover administrative costs. Yesterday in committee, the DirectorGeneral of DG Development made it very clear that the position that you may have on the OCTs was not shared by the Commission. Will the Council therefore clarify what its position on the OCTs is? As a British Member of this Parliament, I am very well aware of the position of the UK, the last Council Presidency. However, PresidentinOffice, I would like to know what your position is.  Also, on administrative costs, how can it be sensible for the Commission to pay itself for the administration of its own resources? This cannot make sense and I am sure is not something that you are familiar with in your own administration. Would the Member States  the Council  be prepared to consider giving additional money to cover the costs of the OCTs? These are not unimportant caveats. I am not introducing them in a casual way, because I really want to know exactly from you how it can be the case that you make these decisions which say that you do not want to give us the assurances that the money that you are giving to the ACP for the ACPs use are funds for those countries to use in a clear and transparent way.  I would also take issue with the assertion that the tenth EDF represents a significant improvement on the ninth EDF. In real terms I would argue that it is nothing more than a stagnation. The Development Committee cannot and will not be duped by what we see as doublespeak on this issue.  The ninth EDF included funds left over from the previous EDF: unspent money. Once this money is added to the ninth EDF, the figures touted by the Council are comparable only in nominal terms. When things are finalised, the tenth EDF will have to be ratified and that presents us with enormous concerns when you consider that  25  Member States will have to be part of this ratification process.  The results of an underspend in the past have been that we have gone in for all these facilities  water facilities, peace facilities  which have had very limited democratic control. Surely this is a matter of concern for you, PresidentinOffice?  Our next debate will be on economic partnership agreements and one of the most contentious issues for us, and which we will raise, will be the financing of aid for trade in the economic partnership agreements. Will you clarify, PresidentinOffice, whether you will be offering additional funds for the EPA negotiations, or whether you expect such funding to come from the ACPs tenth EDF?  Finally, if the African Union is to be included, how will allowances be made for the fact that many members of the African Union are not ACP countries? Do you expect those countries to benefit from EDF money if the Council decides that you will support the African Union from the tenth EDF?  We are talking about a binding agreement with the ACP, and I trust that the Council will reflect that in the decisions it takes on the tenth EDF.
3725112 author: Mary McNabb:  . Mr President, I sincerely hope you will not cut me off. Let me say that I am very happy with the statements of nearly everybody in this debate, especially the remarks that have been made about this portfolio. Competition policy is a challenge; indeed it is an instrument, a motor for achieving the Lisbon Agenda. I could not agree more with Mr De Rossa and Mrs van den Burg that we must deliver, within the framework of Europe, sustainable and full employment and social welfare; but at the end of the day we must also deliver more economic growth and more and better quality jobs.  Turning now to a couple of details about competition policy, it was rightly mentioned that cartels are absolutely unacceptable and we must combat them. Where there is a nearmonopoly, we have to realise that this does not benefit the consumer. People may argue that in the short term it is a pleasing situation, but I can assure you that a monopoly or nearmonopoly will not be very keen to spend money in areas like research or innovation. Yet we badly need that type of investment. Why? Because we have to compete on the global stage, because we need to be aware that competitors from outside Europe are investing in depth in research, in innovation, and in their competitiveness. So, Mr Evans rightly referred to the need for fair treatment, for a bilateral but not unbalanced approach: if we are behaving ourselves, the others should behave as well. It is a question of the competitiveness of Europe.  I really appreciate your interest in competition policy. The Commission informs you of all the major policy initiatives in this area and, of course, I pay attention to all the opinions of Parliament. We may not agree completely at every moment, on every subject, every dossier; I do not agree with a couple of remarks that were made this evening because the way they were put does not reflect the truth and is not realistic. But I will come back to that in more detail.  I have listened carefully to the views expressed by the rapporteur, by the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and by all other Members. I would like to add a few words in response to specific issues. On international cooperation, I think that in a global market competition is very important and the competition authorities need to be in line. Regarding a European network, I am really impressed by the European competition network and those concerned are doing an extremely good job. We can still learn from each other and we still need to realise that the time has passed for national policy. At the end of the day we have one internal market. It is about twoway traffic. Mr McCreevy and I are buddies and we need to tackle all the barriers that have to be tackled.  In relation to Microsoft, which was touched upon by a couple of Members, the Commission is actively pursuing the implementation of the March 2004  decision. I accept, of course, remarks that do not agree with my line, but to say that we are not transparent, that we are not listening to all the questions and remarks, is not the truth. Since March 2004 , there has been a decision, which has rightly been mentioned and discussed; I have done so myself with the head of Microsoft. With regard to ProfessorNeil Barrett, a very highly respected advisor to the Commission, he was indeed appointed by the Commission, but the list he headed came from Microsoft. He is very wellknown for his knowledge and independence and to put it in quite clear language, he is the bridge between Microsoft and the Commission. He is indeed the advisor. But when we took the decision in December  2005 , the statement of objections  which included a preliminary finding that Microsoft had not delivered what it had promised, that its obligation under the March 2004  decision did not take the form we were expecting  was not made public because of issues relating to certain procedures, protectionism and the legitimate interest of all parties. The hearing was an opportunity to have what I hope was a fruitful debate and every participant in it was given the floor. This is not only about Microsoft; there are complainants elsewhere and there are a couple of other really interesting American companies.  So Microsoft is not the only interesting company from the United States: there are a couple of other interesting companies that have lodged complaints with me. Therefore, without a doubt, I had to act and to react. I hope that will clarify the situation when we come to discuss what was talked about last Thursday and Friday. Another hearing  the Court hearing  will take place in Luxembourg on  2428  April  2006 . Once we have discussed what was talked about last week, we will come to a conclusion as soon as possible.  Mrs Bers mentioned Mittals bid for Arcelor. She should read it and she promised me she would, so let me be precise: the announcement of Mittals bid for Arcelor has attracted a great deal of attention not only in the media but also in some European capitals. The operation has not yet been formally notified to the Commission. If and when it is, the Commission will examine it very carefully and impartially and will conduct a wideranging investigation to assess its possible impact on the steel industry in Europe.  It is the responsibility of the Commission, the Commissioner and the services involved always to look very carefully and impartially at all cases. Size and nationality in itself is not a factor in making our decisions. The question is whether a decision can be taken and whether things can be done in the way requested by the parties, or whether there should be remedies. We will be looking at that.  Let me turn to the merger regulation and competence for cases under the twothirds rule, which a couple of Members mentioned. At the moment we are asking the Member States for information. Once we have received that information we will have a debate and dialogue with those Member States and will try to reach conclusions. The rules and decisions were made in the  1980 s and were right for that time, but since then, fortunately, the internal market has developed. I am aware that the internal market is not yet complete, we still have quite a lot of work to do and the four main freedoms still need to be achieved. At that time the twothirds rule was the correct instrument, but now we have to consider whether it is still appropriate in that area. In certain sectors we need to ensure a balance and equal treatment, and there should be transparency regardless of the country in which a merger takes place. Brussels must ensure equal treatment, whatever the background to a merger might be.  Mr Hkmark and Mrs Ferreira raised the subject of mergers in the internal market. We are all aware that concerns have been expressed about the alleged upsurge of protectionism. It should be combated. I can understand it just a little, but it is not allowed and should not be tolerated. We should explain to those concerned that it is not in line with the decision we took on one internal market, one Europe, in which we are and will be in a better position to compete with the outside world. The Commission has significant powers under the Treaty to act as an independent and impartial referee to ensure that Member States fully respect the internal market rules and do not create unlawful obstacles to crossborder mergers. I can assure you that the Commission is firmly committed both to using these powers and to corporate restructuring in Europe. For that we need a united Europe.  It was rightly said that we must apply the rules of the game in the same way whether the team is playing at home or abroad. We have rules to respect and we have decisions to respect  the decisions taken in the past. We have to implement those decisions: one internal market and the Lisbon Agenda. Nearly all of you agreed that we should fight for that.
2242248 author: Claire McNabb:  . Mr President, I would like to associate myself wholeheartedly with the statement by my friend Mr Hammerstein Mintz. I was the original rapporteur on Regulation (EC) No 10492001  on public access to documents and I well remember the heated debates, not only within Parliament but within the Council and within the trialogue, as we set out to win the arguments for what was at that time a groundbreaking regulation. I remember  and it is worth naming some of the old EU 15   the vehement opposition from France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Austria. I am pleased to say that the Austrian Presidency has now changed its attitude, but I mention this because it shows what a long way we have come.  There are different approaches to openness and transparency. We have the wonderful Nordic example, and then we have the rather suspicious view taken in other Member States, but arguably we have nothing whatsoever to fear from transparency. What is there to fear from opening our decisions to external examination? What does a Member State have to fear from explaining to its own parliament why the minister voted as he or she did?  I make several recommendations in my report and I call upon the Commission to take action. We recognise that Regulation (EC) No 10492001  was not the end of the game but merely the beginning of a long  arguably cultural  journey to win the argument for openness and transparency within the three institutions. We come from different traditions. That is why I have called for a further review of the regulation. This review was provided for in the original recommendation and there are several areas concerning the regulations implementation which now, several years later, could be substantially improved on the basis of the lessons that we have learned from its implementation.  We need to look again at the definitions of legislative and nonlegislative texts in relation to public access to documents, in order to ensure that all the institutions are working in an open and transparent manner. Access to documents is not a gift  it is a right. This is especially important when Parliament and the Council are working in a legislative capacity. Increased interinstitutional cooperation and increased use of the codecision procedure necessitate greater openness by the Council in particular. Citizens must be able to see what is being agreed in their names by national ministers of national governments so that they and opposition parties can hold them to account.  We need to look at the way we define the circumstances in which specific documents can be classified completely, or in part, as confidential. These rules should provide legitimate derogations for specific clearlydefined reasons, but should not be interpreted in a broad sense, which would essentially have the result of denying public access to documents.  Here is the point on which I shall finish: we won the argument from  1999  until May  2001  when the regulation was adopted. Time and time again we have won the argument for a review of the internal rules of the institutions so that the Council in particular, when meeting in its legislative capacity, should meet in public and vote in public. The arguments have been won. I know the VicePresident is personally committed to the whole notion of openness and transparency. The House is committed, but that is not enough. We have a wonderful window of opportunity on  9 May, Europe Day. Let us make Europe Day a positive day when we can announce how we will improve the citizens right to know what is done in their name.  Finally, there is a rise of antiEuropeanism, not least in the ten new countries that joined us two years ago. Often governments which bring a country into the family of the European Union suffer as a result; they are not reelected. We would be a friend of antiEuropeanism if we continue to cloak what we do in secrecy. Let us take on the antiEuropeans. Let us promote our institutions. Let us celebrate what we do. Let us bring forward that review of Regulation (EC) No 10492001 , not reluctantly but with enthusiasm.
9208963 author: Sarah White:  . Mr President, when we debated this proposal at the February partsession I said that the Commission would base its modified proposal on what Parliament voted. I believe you will see that we have honoured that commitment in the text adopted by the College today. We have endeavoured to respect the consensus you have reached on some of the key articles. You will find the amendments you have voted to Article  16   freedom to provide services  and Article  17   derogations from freedom to supply services  reflected in the modified proposal. We have excluded all healthcare from the scope of the proposal and, in line with the commitment given, we will come forward with a separate initiative on the health sector. The modified proposal also provides for the exclusion of taxation, temporary work agencies, security services and the audiovisual sector from the scope of the proposal.  One issue on scope where we did not follow you is the exclusion of legal services. The Commission considers this is not required given that Article  3  already provides that in case of conflict between a specific directive and this proposal it is the former that will prevail. In addition, we have brought the wording on the exercise of an official authority in line with Article 45  of the EC Treaty.  We have based the exclusion of social services on the various amendments you adopted in this regard. I am sure you will agree that any exclusion must be clearly defined, and this is what we have attempted to do.  If we want to avoid diverging interpretation in Member States, then we must provide legal certainty. The text of the modified proposal specifies that the exclusion from the directive concerns those social services relating to social housing, children and support to families and persons in need which are provided by the state or by providers mandated by the state. In addition, the Commission will come forward in the next few weeks with a communication on social services of general interest, reflecting the importance these services have for our citizens.  The decision to remove all interaction between the services proposal and labour law has in my opinion been one of the most important elements in creating a more positive atmosphere around this new services proposal. This has allowed us to move on from the allegations of lowering of social standards and threats to the European social model. While this perception was wrong, it did not go away, and poisoned the debate on this important proposal. In any event, the modified proposal is clear in this regard: labour law is completely removed. As part of the fallout from this, Articles 24  and  25  have been removed from the modified proposal.  However, as I said during the debate in February, the Commission would come forward with a communication to address the issues surrounding the posting of workers, which Articles 24  and  25  were designed to address. In a moment my colleague Vladimir pidla will outline to you the approach the Commission adopted today. I just want to add that this communication is a vital element in our efforts to reach agreement in the Council on the services proposal.  There are two other issues in the modified proposal that I want to highlight. We have clarified in Article 3  that all special laws take precedence over the provisions of the services proposal. In particular, we have made it clear in Article 3  that the directive does not affect private international law and that, as a consequence, consumers will in principle benefit from the protection granted to them by the consumer protection rule laid down in the consumer legislation in force in their Member State. The Commission has also accepted that the professional liability insurance in Article 27  should be optional instead of compulsory.  Since the European Parliament voted in February, there has been a growing realisation throughout the European Union that the consensus you achieved was the basis for taking this debate forward. Heads of Government at the European Council two weeks ago supported this. We have a window of opportunity for building on this growing consensus. I want to see the potential for growth and jobs that this proposal will bring realised as soon as possible.  I will now present this modified proposal to the informal Competitiveness Council in Graz later this month. I feel confident that, with the active support of the Austrian Presidency and Member States, we stand a real chance of making significant progress during this Presidency.
4308059 author: Claire Brown:  . Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I very much welcome this joint debate on better regulation and the opportunity to discuss with the Council and the Commission how we can improve the regulatory experience for consumers, citizens and businesses that are at the sharp end of making sense of implementing EU laws. The confidence and trust of citizens, consumers and business in the EU itself is linked to their experience and perception of EU laws and the impact they have on their daily lives.  I want to focus on improving better regulation for the internal market and ensuring that we achieve a sense of purpose in our lawmaking for consumers in the internal market. The internal market accounts for almost one third of the Community . Goodquality, effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for crossborder trade and give consumers increased choice, while protecting environmental, social and consumer rights. At the same time, getting legislation right in the internal market is critical to achieving the Lisbon goals of jobs, growth and competitiveness.  I believe that the internal market will benefit most from a joint and coordinated approach by all three institutions to improving the entire regulatory cycle. That means that we also need to think of the consequences of the midnight deals and compromises that we make, and consider whether they are going to confuse or clarify laws for end users. That starts, in my view, with good, clear drafting of laws, highquality impact assessments and effective, comprehensive and transparent stakeholder consultation. The Member States too must take their responsibilities seriously and ensure good and correct implementation of internal market laws. They must resist the temptation often to goldplate or add on national requirements. Although transposition rates are improving, as shown in the internal market scoreboards, there is still room for much improvement. That is why we are asking for a fasttrack infringement procedure for test cases in the internal market. We need to learn from the failures and mistakes of EU laws. That is why we would like to see both and, in particular, impact assessments or evaluations of where we went wrong. Has this legislation achieved its objective or, on the contrary, has it led to distortion and fragmentation of the internal market?  Some believe that the impact assessments should be handed over to an external body. I do not share that approach, as I believe that the internal market laws should be the responsibility of Commission officials as part of the discipline of effective policymaking. However, the Internal Market Committee insists that all legislative proposals be accompanied by a quality impact assessment, a summary and a better regulation checklist on internal market proposals.  Of course alternative regulation is a subject of much scepticism. While the interinstitutional agreement provides for this nonlegislative option, we insist with respect to internal market laws that Parliament is both informed of and consulted on such alternative approaches. They are justified by impact assessments. Equally, we must have redress for the consumer and sanctions if these alternative regulations fail to deliver benefits for the consumer in the internal market.  I want to stress the work of the Internal Market Committee as an active partner in the better regulation process. I know that Commissioners often say that Parliament does not take its role seriously. We were the first committee to commission our own impact assessment, under Mr Whiteheads chairmanship, for amendments on the Toubon report on nominal quantities for prepacked products. On the pyrotechnics proposal we are conducting an impact assessment on amendments proposed by our rapporteur. We will look at a costbenefit analysis of his amendments to that proposal. We are conducting a hearing on the impact of public procurement laws on the internal market. EU public procurement accounts for  16  of EU GDP, yet the  1992  package of laws, as demonstrated in a number of ECJ cases, has not achieved the desired opening of the market.  Let us be clear. It is the consumer, the citizen and businesses that pay the price when laws are not effective. Bad drafting leads to legal uncertainty, poor or confused transposition and at the end of the line is a confused businessman or consumer who loses confidence in the internal market. The ECJ, after years of deliberation, becomes the arbiter of better legislation. That is not the right way forward.  Finally, I want to quote the cases of SOLVIT, which I believe is an excellent initiative of the Commission. A qualified doctor tried for a number of years to register as a doctor in Spain. He spent a large sum of money on legal fees, had lost confidence in the internal market, yet the SOLVIT system intervened and helped him within ten weeks to get registration in Spain as a doctor. That doctor said: SOLVIT has restored my confidence in the internal market.  So, the reality is that good laws that are well drafted, easy to implement, easy to enforce and police, are the key to restoring confidence in the internal market. I hope that todays debate is the beginning of a process of close cooperation, sharing best practice between the institutions in a close partnership of equals, to build and restore that confidence that the doctor I mentioned was asking us to achieve for him as a consumer in the internal market.
4080336 author: James Merx:  . Mr President, I think Mr Solana has already covered nearly everything, but let me add a few comments because the Commission is facing a very difficult period of profound and rapid change in the Middle East. How we react and how the parties position themselves will have a determining influence on the prospects for moving towards what I hope will be a peaceful solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict.  We have congratulated acting Prime Minister Olmert on Kadimas election victory. This undoubtedly represents some shift in Israeli politics and we await with interest the outcome of the coalition negotiations currently taking place. That will take some time.  Let me underline that we, as the European Union, stand ready to work with the next Israeli Government to promote security and peace, but for both Israelis and Palestinians alike. I am convinced that the majority of the population in both countries profoundly desires a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict. As for the European Unions bilateral relationship with Israel, our sincere wish is to reinforce a strong, balanced relationship between us, reflected in our Association Agreement and in our ENP Action Plan. We want to continue the progress that already has been made in implementing the action plan in areas such as human rights, the protection of minorities, research and development, as well as economic integration.  There has been much speculation about the impact these elections will have on the prospects for peace, which MrSolana has just tried to outline. One might be tempted to believe that the election result broadly endorsed acting Prime Minister Olmerts avowed intention to proceed with the establishment of permanent borders for Israel by  2010 , following further disengagement from the occupied West Bank. The question for us is how this will be done. We strongly believe that Israels legitimate security concerns cannot be met and I would like to reiterate this on behalf of the Commission through unilateral action or decisions imposed by force. Only a negotiated settlement will be sustainable.  The European Union would only support changes to the pre 1967  borders that were agreed by consensus between the parties. We support a twostate solution leading to a final and comprehensive settlement of the conflict, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side within secure and mutually recognised borders.  I think it is important to say again and again that we should underline to our Israeli partners the importance of refraining from any action that may prejudice final status negotiations. The Commission expects the next Israeli Government to reaffirm its commitment to a negotiated solution by full implementation of the Quartets roadmap, and to show this in deeds as well as words. But as ever, we have to work with both sides. Just as we must be clear with the new Israeli Government, we also have to be very firm with the new Palestinian Government. There can be no compromise on the Quartets principles  Mr Solana has just outlined them, we have mentioned them in the Council statement, we have also mentioned them in the Quartet.  We expect the new Palestinian Government sworn in last week to commit to the principles of nonviolence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the roadmap, which then bind the Palestinian Authority to the fundamental principles of peace, democracy, respect for the rule of law and human rights. Of course, we have heard quite a number of comments, some of which go further; but we have also seen some very slight signs of possible solutions, possible changes.  We are fully aware of the considerable economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians and indeed we do not want to let them down and of the need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and extremism. That is why the Commission has already mobilised over EUR 120 million to help meet the basic needs of the Palestinians and to stabilise the finances of the caretaker government, which has just left office. That is why we intend to continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid and assistance for basic human needs.  But, and I must repeat this because it will be the basis for what can be done, unless the new government complies with the Quartets conditions, there can be no business as usual. Unless circumstances change, there will inevitably be an impact on assistance to the Palestinian Government, which the Commission is now reviewing in line with the Quartet statement. In this regard, we are just preparing the next Council, where we will try to come up with lines of approach; we will not have full solutions, but we will try to move in the right direction.  So the onus is clearly on the Palestinian side, and on the new Israeli Government to act responsibly in fulfilling its obligations. I firmly believe that both sides, especially the population, are tired of the conflict and desperate for peace, but it is up to their leaders to show responsibility and statesmanship as we move forward. It is in their hands, and only in theirs, to put an end to the violence and despair that has blighted the lives of so many generations. We are ready to work both within the European institutions and with the international community to make this possible, even in the most difficult circumstances.
3768678 author: Katarina LaCourt:  . Mr President, I would like to remind honourable Members of Parliament that something very important has taken place in these elections. The elections in both Palestine and Israel have created a new political class. The political parties that have dominated life in Israel and Palestine over the last  20  years have disappeared or have come very low in the polls. New parties have appeared that were created only months ago. New people have appeared as leaders. What does that mean? It probably means many things, but at least for us it should mean something new, so far as the leadership is concerned. We have to invest some hope in this movement to see if we can take advantage of the situation to move the process forward.  I have the impression and the deep conviction that the result of these elections is a profound change in the social structure of both societies. On the part of the Palestinians there is probably no desire to have a nonsecular government. I would very much like to insist on that. I do not believe that the majority of people in Palestine voted for Hamas because they wanted a religious government at the head of the Palestinian Authority. I believe they voted against other things that are more closely related to the tyrannies of not doing things properly, of corruption, of a lack of proper organisation.  We have to make the effort now to do our utmost to ensure that Palestine, which is probably the most secular part of the Middle East, does not revert to something that probably the majority of Palestinian people do not want. But at the same time there have to be people in government who are able to produce the results that the majority of people want: social services, no corruption, democracy, etc. This is where we have to make our most important impact.  It is the same in Jerusalem, the same in Israel. When you see that the Prime Minister is going to be Ehud Olmert and not Mr Sharon, it is really very impressive: what a profound change has taken place in such a short period of time. The person who led Kadima and Likud, the party that has been running affairs in Jerusalem for more than  20  years, is now suffering in hospital. There is a new party with a new leader whom nobody expected to be the leader today.  Now, does it open possibilities? Let me believe that it opens possibilities. Are we going to use those possibilities? I like to think that, yes, we are going to take advantage of those possibilities. When I talk to Mr Olmert, as I do frequently, I keep telling him unilateralism is not possible. We have seen that already. It was not possible to disengage from Gaza unilaterally. In the end, they first had to call on the international community and then they had to call the Palestinian side, because it is impossible to unravel a situation which is so united and do it unilaterally.  Mr CohnBendit said that it is terrible that avian flu may spread from Israel to Palestine. There has been a statement today saying that we have to make sure that avian flu does not spread from one place to the other. The same person did not say that poverty cannot spread from one to the other; that suffering cannot spread from one to the other. Sometimes, it seems as though we are more concerned about the spread of avian flu and are not really concerned about the suffering, the misery and the tragedy that have existed there for years. The peoples are separated by a barrier, which may not stop avian flu but may stop people going from one place to the other.  That is something really sad. We have to be able to do both things to cooperate so that avian flu does not spread, and ensure that people can move, workers can move, and progress can be made, and I think that is much more important.  In  1980  we said something very important, which has been upheld. Not long ago we said that we believe that the  1967  borders are the starting point for negotiations. I would like to repeat that today in this Parliament. We are ready to defend that; we are ready to accept changes to borders agreed by most people by both parties. But we cannot imagine any other solution that does not take into consideration the premise that the negotiations have to start around the  1967  borders.  I should also like to say that everybody has to be given the opportunity to change. Mr CohnBendit has changed. I have changed. How many people in this chamber have changed? And I think we have all changed for the better. Why do we not think that people can change for the better?  Now we have to give this opportunity, but we have to be very tough until the moment they change. We have to tell them that if they change they will have the opportunity to be part of the team. But, if they do not change, unfortunately they will not be part of it. As I said before, it is very difficult to change the past. Nobody can change his past, only lighten his memories, as many people do. In the future, yes, we can change. We have to act to create the conditions so that people can behave differently in future.  I would like to see Hamas change and recognise Israel. It is impossible to negotiate if you do not recognise that the other has a right to exist. That has to be reciprocal too. It is impossible to negotiate if you do not want to negotiate and at the same time you want to have a pistol in your pocket. This is not negotiation. That is the type of message we have to get across.  We also have to push for plurality in Palestinian society. It has been the most secular society and continues to be secular, not subject to an imposed religious society as has been represented in some Hamas statements. It is a very important point and we have to think about it for the first time. A group that belongs to the Muslim Brothers has arrived in power democratically. We have to think about this because it has happened in Palestine. It may happen in other places, and we have to think about how we are we going to deal with it. I should very much like these elements to be considered not only by think tanks, but also by political players in the European Union.  I have hope in my heart and I would like you to have hope in your hearts. Together let us see whether we can fulfil the hopes that I am sure you have in your hearts.
5388902 author: Philip Whittacker:  . Mr President, I think the key message here was that we would like to be able to include Belarus in the Neighbourhood Policy. That is what we would like to do, with all the benefits for the population and the country. Let me answer a few of those specific matters brought up again in the discussion.  Regarding Belarus, we are granting support to NGOs registered outside Belarus for activities benefiting Belarus through the EIDHR, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and that is not natural because, according to our rules, normally we can only work with NGOs inside the country, so we have tried to find a flexible solution. That flexibility will be continued over the coming years. An additional EUR 420000  will soon be made available to NGOs located outside Belarus under the same instrument, and calls for proposals are there.  Our future assistance tools that will replace the EIDHR and decentralised cooperation for the next period under the financial perspectives will allow for assistance to be granted outside Belarus. And we are currently finalising a proposal for our assistance strategy for the coming years.  The media project was mentioned. It was very important to start with the media project that we financed. We financed five components of the media: TV, radio, the internet, support for the independent written press and the training of journalists over the next  24  months. We will have to continue with that. The daily radio broadcasts and the weekly TV programmes for Belarus started in February and immediately  I would say, two weeks after we had signed the contract  we tried to do everything to make the population of Belarus aware of that. Both the radio and TV components will keep providing independent, reliable and  we hope  very balanced information on Belarus, as well as on the EU, on the diversity of its  25 Member countries, and on our relations with Belarus. We, the Commission, will keep on developing synergies with other donors in the scope of this project, and radio programmes are now broadcast by a number of technical providers, via both FM and AM waves  I know that is another concern  and via the internet, which includes downloading options.  On the question of visa facilitation, we know that this is something that has been requested. The general approach on visa facilitation that was adopted by the Council in December last year stated that, as opposed to readmission agreements, visa facilitation shall not be offered to third countries proactively. Despite this general common position, we are looking for possibilities to facilitate peopletopeople contacts between the European Union and Belarus through measures waiving visa fees on an basis. It is not yet decided, but it is in the pipeline. In that respect, the existing and measures under preparation already provide for the appropriate for Member States to hopefully waiver visa fees for visitors from Belarus.  Finally, on the question of students, we are very much inclined to facilitate access of Belarusian students to its universities. We fully share the view expressed by many of you that students have to be helped, not least because they have been the platform, the basis and the bulk of those who have protested peacefully after the elections, but also because the cementing of democracy will rest very much on their shoulders. Therefore we can facilitate access of the students to our universities, provided that all the Member States and the Commission pull their forces together and provided that we can find some sort of coordination between Member States and us, and I think the Commission would be ready to do that.  This will also require financial efforts, which we are ready to consider. We have the Tempus and Erasmus programmes and, along with efforts made by the Member States, I think we can do a lot.  Finally, on Russia, as Mr Winkler has already said, Russia is always clearly a topic in political dialogue because we speak about our common neighbours. These include the South Caucasus, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. President Barroso spoke with vigour on  17 March and reminded President Putin of our wellknown position on democratisation but also warned that we would not accept violence on election day. There was no bloodshed during the elections on election day, but Russia needs to be convinced that leaders other than President Lukashenko would not threaten the special relationship with Belarus. You can be assured that we will try to go on working for you and with you on this issue.
2719194 author: Jennifer Jones:  . Mr President, the global shortage of doctors, nurses and other health professionals has reached a crisis point in many parts of the world. Ageing populations in Europe, the United States and most wealthy countries, combined with increasingly sophisticated medical treatments that require specialised staff, mean that demand for health workers in the developed world is outstripping supply. Indeed, the demand for health workers is not only outstripping our internal capacity to produce doctors and nurses: it is placing a huge strain on the international market for health workers.  However, the shortage of health workers in rich nations does not even begin to approach the severe shortages being experienced in many parts of Africa, where the lack of health workers can often mean the difference between life and death. With less than one health worker per  1000  people in Africa, compared to over  10  health workers per  1000  people in Europe, it is hardly surprising that the shocking and unacceptable death toll of children and their mothers continues. More than one in five children die before their fifth birthday and more than one in a hundred mothers die as a result of complications of pregnancy in many African countries. Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in Africa is unacceptably slow, with progress reversal in some countries as a consequence of HIVAids. The burden of caring for the sick falls on families and communities who have few resources to cope with this significant burden.  The World Health Report for  2006  focuses international attention on the health worker shortage, and is very much welcomed. It puts a spotlight on a crisis that has been evolving over many years, but that now represents probably the most significant barrier to progressing towards the healthrelated Millennium Development Goals  reducing maternal and child mortality and controlling communicable diseases such as HIVAids, TB and malaria. Without doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health workers, it will be impossible to improve healthcare, or to meet our commitments to increase access to essential services.  The causes of this crisis are complex. There has been chronic underinvestment in health services in developing countries for many years, including underinvestment in training of health workers. Many countries in Africa are still trying to run their health services on a budget of less than EUR 10  per capita  that is much less than the minimum of EUR 30  recognised as necessary for providing essential services.  But the problem is not just lack of investment in Africa. Many countries in Europe and elsewhere have underinvested and inadequately planned for health worker training to meet the needs of ageing populations. The rich world can attract health workers from other countries; the consequences for poor countries is that they train health workers who leave the country, effectively providing a perverse subsidy to health services in developed countries, by shouldering the burden of training costs.  Training more health workers worldwide is only part of the solution. Many health workers who are trained do not want to work in the poorest and most remote areas where needs are greatest. There is a pattern of internal migration from rural to urban areas, and from the public to the private sector, and from poor countries to richer neighbouring countries and then to the richer, developed world. However, it is difficult to blame the individual, once you have seen the conditions under which they have to work. We need to better understand the motivations of health workers, and to create incentive systems that encourage them to work where there is the greatest need.  The push factors of poor working conditions, low salaries  which are paid irregularly, lack of drugs and equipment and lack of career prospects all contribute to the migration of health workers. Indeed, it is surprising that, given these poor conditions, you still get a hard core of dedicated health workers in many African countries who continue to do a remarkable job in very difficult circumstances. It is important not to lose sight of the achievement and the increasable contribution of many health workers who continue to serve their people, despite the challenges of their jobs and working environment.  The pull factors for migration  better salaries in rich countries, better working conditions and greater security, which are sometimes coupled with aggressive recruitment practices by private recruitment agencies  also play a significant role in increasing health worker mobility.  These issues have all been described in the communication from the Commission to Parliament on the EU strategy of action to address the crisis in human resources for health in developing countries. If we are to overcome the crisis, developing solutions must begin in the countries most affected and must support strengthening of their planning and financing of health worker training, support and finance, and improved terms of conditions of services. It is essential that country action be supported by regional and global action, sharing knowledge and best practice, sharing training resources and changing international recruitment policies to make them more ethical. It is important that we look closely at our own health worker training programmes and increase our own production capacity, to make us more selfsufficient.  The Commission has been leading and coordinating the development of a coherent European response. The communication on human resources for health has been debated and strong conclusions are due to be adopted by the Council. EU Member States have agreed a Statement of Commitment, which is being announced for World Health Day. That should demonstrate to the rest of the world that Europe takes this issue seriously and will support a significant response to the crisis.
9142622 author: Helen McNabb:  Mr President, it is an interesting statistic that there are more nurses from Malawi living in Manchester, in the United Kingdom, than there are living in Malawi; and there are more doctors from Ethiopia living in Chicago than there are in Ethiopia. There is an estimated global shortage of  820000  doctors, nurses and other health workers. Obviously human resources are a central part of all human healthcare systems, but the reality is that the recruitment of health professionals and the scourge of HIVAids are continuing to prolong the crisis already afflicting very fragile healthcare systems in developing countries.  Many leave developing countries  as you said, Commissioner  because in developing countries they earn low wages, have poor working conditions, little prospect of advancement and a lack of training. In addition they have the pressure of dealing with high numbers of patients with HIVAids and other very difficult diseases.  This brain drain is the major obstacle to providing quality care in Africa. Countries are losing the most qualified and experienced nurses. Last year Kenya lost  3000  graduate nurses to other countries, mostly to the United States and the United Kingdom. There is a net flow of skills away from Africa, where individuals make decisions to go where they can earn and where they can take their careers forward. Many women that I have met across the United Kingdom working in elderly care centres, etc., are doing so because they want to earn money in order to send money back to care for their children in the countries where they come from. A consequence is that that the losing nations do not have that skill space that they need to educate their young people and develop their own economies. We in the European Union have to look at ways to compensate those countries that are being so drained of the skills that they need.  I welcome the Commissions urgent attention to the crisis. We hope that we will see strategies  and that is the next step  that can deal with the root causes of the problem we are talking about this evening. That problem is that in spite of the terrible burden of disease there, Africa only has  0 . 6  of the worlds registered healthcare workers. How can that be acceptable when the healthcare and disease pressures are so enormous there?  I am concerned by Commissioner Frattinis recent proposal to promote the recruitment of highly educated immigrants, including the creation of a green card for researchers, engineers and doctors. Parliament must call for an active end to the recruitment of health workers. It rightly calls for the European Union to press for a global code of conduct on ethical recruitment. Commissioner, would you subscribe to the view that this is something that the Commission should do in order to try to deal with this crisis, which is what this evenings debate is all about?  The other side of the coin is that in Europe we have an ageing population and we have declining birth rates. We are therefore trying to suck in the health workers from other countries in order to deal with our own problems. Raising wages to levels comparable with the industrialised world is very difficult for developing countries, but funding must be targeted at the health system and efforts must be made to decentralise healthcare and to support regional development.  I also believe  and noone else has mentioned this, but it is in the resolution  that telemedicine is a very important way of dealing with this issue. I was recently in Mauritania and saw how, in a very small hospital in a desert area of that country, health workers were making contact with French doctors in order to have some consultation on diagnoses for patients. That is something we could also look at investing in, in a more serious way than we do currently.  With regard to nurse practitioners, nurses should be given more status in developing countries than they now have. That is very important, as it is to look at what countries such as Uganda are doing, which is to decentralise the health service and take it out of the main cities, into the rural areas.  If we are actually going to deliver on the Millennium Development Goals we have a huge task. In relation to health, it is a major task and we need to make a contribution. In relation to the financial perspectives we are now discussing, we really do not have the options to deliver on the debates and on the commitments that you have discussed this evening.
2912137 author: Lynne Merx:  . Mr President, I am very impressed by the passionate contributions on this very important issue.  The process that the Commission is leading to develop an EU response to the human resources crisis demonstrates the strength of greater European coordination. The collective commitment of Member States and of the Commission is likely to have a much greater impact than the Commission or Member States working alone.  The response to the human resources crisis reflects the principle set out in . It is the Member States commitment to increase the overall levels of development assistance, moving towards the target of  0 . 7  of GNI as ODA, that will provide the increasing budget for accelerated progress. But it is the coordinated efforts of the European Community that will ensure that the increased resources are more efficiently spent, providing coordinated, coherent backing for countryled and developed plans.  We believe that better coordinated and more coherent implementation of our common European policy, reflecting the commitments made in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, provides the best means for a drastic increase in human and social development spending. That needs to be prioritised by the Member States and reflected in our common policy.  That is why the Commission has proposed a package of concrete measures on aid effectiveness. The package will allow the European Union to deliver more, faster and better aid.  At the Paris aid effectiveness meeting, the European Union made a commitment to increase the proportion of aid it provides as budget support. That commitment includes the potential to increase funding for both general and sector budget support, complemented, if necessary, by projecttype funding. Delegations making programming decisions for the  10 th EDF therefore have a choice of aid instruments with which to respond to nationally defined priorities. There is considerable scope for the national decisionmaking and country programming processes to focus increased effort on the health or social sectors through sector budget support, if that is prioritised at country level.  I should just like to answer some of the more specific questions that have been raised.  On the question of a code of conduct, I can confirm that the Commission is willing to consider how to develop and implement a European code of conduct for the ethical recruitment of health workers. On the question of tailored medicine, which was raised by two Members, we are currently supporting a study on the potential of trying to make better use of the available efforts as part of our partnership with the African Union.  Corruption is indeed a problem for development and particularly damaging for the delivery of key social services, such as health. As you know, we agreed on the need to address that problem through a whole range of measures. Tomorrow we will have plenty of time to have a more indepth discussion, when we discuss Mrvan den Bergs excellent report on the issue.  Several Members have mentioned the question of the proportion of development funds that is allocated to human and social development. Most Commission financing is allocated through country programming. Currently, over  20  of the Commissions development budget is allocated to social infrastructure. In addition, general budget support financing includes linkage to progress measured against health indicators and is therefore a mechanism for supporting and reinforcing countrylevel prioritisation of the Millennium Development Goals.  The Commission will be increasing the proportion of development assistance given as budget support and will seek to increase the link between budget support and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. The decision on the proportion of financing allocated by countries to human and social development is ultimately a question for national governments. The Commission will continue in its policy dialogue with governments to emphasise the importance of human and social development for economic growth and for poverty reduction.
5104998 author: Katarina Reid:  . Mr President, in recent weeks and months we have been accustomed to frequent press coverage of new outbreaks of avian influenza. The latest outbreak was confirmed today in a turkey farm in Saxony. We have been able to follow the diseases development on maps as we have seen it spreading from one country to another. We are all affected either directly or indirectly.  We  and in particular the poultry sector  are faced with a real crisis situation, which requires a swift response. That is why we are here tonight. I would therefore, first of all, like to thank the European Parliament for having accepted the Commissions request for urgent procedure. I am especially grateful to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Joseph Daul, as well as to the rest of the committee for their rapid contribution and opinion on the Commission proposal. That is a clear testimony that when there is a need for us to act fast, we can do so.  The many cases of avian influenza in the European Union have not left us unaffected. Even though mainly wild birds have been the victims of avian flu, it has already had a strong negative impact on European consumption of poultry in many Member States. The impact on prices has varied from country to country, but in general prices have been under pressure and have in some cases fallen significantly. As a result, the poultry meat market faces an exceptionally serious situation and many in the poultry sector are in severe difficulties.  We have already acted. Since the beginning of the crisis last autumn, the Commission has made use of export refunds in order to support the market. But the effects of those measures have been limited, not least as we have been faced with import restrictions on our exports into many third countries. It is clear that we cannot handle the poultry meat crisis effectively on the basis of export refunds alone.  Member States have also announced or taken initiatives with regard to the possibility of using state aid. There is a broad range of support possibilities via state aid, such as rescue and restructuring aid for farmers running into difficulties. Those rules are designed to give quick, effective support to those in the sector who are really in need. We will, in the light of the crisis, examine any proposal as quickly as possible, taking into account both the need for rapid help and the need to avoid distortion of competition. However, we also need to consider alternative measures at EU level. And therefore we have found ourselves hampered by the existing legislation. Our current CMO provides for measures that would allow special market support in cases where veterinary restrictions have been imposed.  The current scope of our CMO, however, does not allow the Commission to act in response to a crisis that is sparked by a lack of consumer confidence. And that is exactly the situation we are in today. Therefore the existing legal framework has to be changed in order to provide the legal basis for new market support measures for the sector. We are therefore proposing to extend the existing exceptional market support as laid down in Article 14  of the CMO in order to include support measures in cases where serious market disturbances are caused by consumer reaction to public health or animal health risks. Our proposal also entails a sharing of the financial burden between Member States and the Community budget and would only be introduced upon a request from the Member States.  We are now taking a first step. We are filling the legal gap. Once our proposal is finally adopted, Member States will have to submit their proposals for practical steps that will fit their specific situation. We believe that will allow the best possible flexibility, and therefore the most efficient response to the current crisis and to future similar situations, if they were to arise.  There is no time to waste. Thanks to the European Parliaments constructive stance and the rapid procedure it has chosen via which to consider this proposal, we should now be able to ensure a final adoption in the Council in the coming weeks. This will be an important step towards delivering those measures that our poultry sector is so desperately asking for.
7062705 author: Victor Brown:  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. The Commission is particularly keen on ensuring that the aid it manages serves the objectives of combating and ultimately eradicating poverty, and in that respect the power management of financial resources is crucial. Hence the decision to make governance in general a horizontal and central theme in the programming of the tenth EDF, because combating corruption can only be successful when embedded in a broader agenda of capacity building.  In this context we share the view of the rapporteur, Mrvan den Berg, on the importance and scale of the problem. Corruption is indeed a major obstacle to development. It hits the poorest in developing countries the hardest. It is responsible for political instability and the violation of human rights, and it reduces the level of resources available for development funding.  Secondly, we agree that corruption is a very complex phenomenon which needs to be addressed through a whole range of different measures. International agreements are important, and the report notes that the UNConvention on Corruption still has to be ratified by several of our Member States. We need to work with privatesector organisations, and we need civil society watchdogs.  In our assistance programmes we have various measures to support good governance, such as reforms of the legal system, support for Supreme Audit Institutions, assistance for civil society, and support for national parliaments, which was the subject of a debate at the recent ACPEU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. We already support civil society watchdogs, for instance Transparency International chapters in some countries.  Thirdly, on budget support, MrvandenBerg pays particular attention to that, and rightly so, not because it is especially prone to corruption, but because it is part of the solution. Its big advantage is that it directly addresses a major source of corruption in many countries, namely the weak management of public finances.  Our budget support goes only to those countries which are clearly committed to reforming their public finance system and, by strengthening sensitive areas like public procurement, it makes an important contribution to the fight against corruption. Projecttype assistance, on the other hand, is heavily based on public procurement but cannot address weaknesses in the system.  You are aware of the special report by the Court of Auditors on public finance management in the framework of budget support in ACP countries, which supports the approach adopted by the Commission. I also want to highlight the importance of the harmonisation agenda, which was the focus of the Paris Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in March this year and emphasises the importance of strengthening beneficiary country systems of financial management and control, which is precisely one of the things that we are doing. One note of caution, however: budget support is not earmarked for a specific sector, but specific sectoral reform measures and targets can establish the conditions for the funds which are, of course, paid into the general budget.  Fourthly, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness also underlines the importance of improving the transparency of public procurement procedures in our partner countries. Those procedures are often a source of corruption.  My last point concerns our colleagues in the field. One of the key objectives of the devolution process is to ensure that aid is more closely supervised in the field and to make the most of the detailed local knowledge of our incountry staff. Delegations can check that aid is properly used. Moreover, for some kinds of contract we now require external audits before we make the final payment, and a comprehensive system for programming external audits was introduced in  2003 , covering audits to be launched both by headquarters and by delegations.  In summary, we share much of Mr van den Bergs analysis. We think more attention could be paid to public procurement issues, and we think some of the detailed measures proposed need to be reviewed and discussed further.
731745 author: Sebastian LaCourt:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to the lives lost and the communities hurt in the Chernobyl devastation. We know from the Latvian press that many people are still suffering the consequences, even now. Latvia was not directly affected, but we have  6000  liquidators. Today half of them are invalids and  500  are dead.  My personal contact with Chernobyl was very close. On the day of the accident I was kayaking in Ukraine and I heard about it only two days later when one of the locals asked me whether I had heard about the accident at the nuclear power station nearby. My second contact with it was through my brotherinlaw, an ordinary man who was called to liquidate the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.  On the  20 th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, the European Commission joins the European Parliament in a thorough reflection on the consequences of the accident and, in particular, on the lessons learned.  Firstly, since  1991 , the European Union has provided important financial assistance to improve nuclear safety in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Kazakhstan, including the consequences at the Chernobyl site itself. To Ukraine alone, the Community has provided more than half a billion euros in assistance to projects relating to nuclear safety, including assistance to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.  As a measure of continued EU commitment, the Commission has also proposed an instrument for nuclear safety to reinforce it outside the European Union borders for the period  20072013 , with a proposed budget of EUR 500 million.  For the international community, the Chernobyl accident represented a turning point, raising awareness of the need for rules and common standards to reduce the risk of an accident to a minimum, as well as preparation for immediate reaction in case of a radiological emergency. A number of international conventions signed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency reflect the response of the international community in the wake of the accident: the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident; the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency; the Convention on Nuclear Safety; the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material; and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. The European Atomic Energy Community and the Member States are contracting parties to all these conventions.  At European level, I would recall that the chapter in the Euratom Treaty on health and safety provides both for the protection of the health of workers and of the general public against the dangers arising from radiation. The Treaty also obliges Member States and operators to supply the Commission with regular information on installations and nuclear material in their possession.  In addition, secondary legislation reflects the lessons learnt from the Chernobyl tragedy. This includes foodstuffs legislation: soon after the accident, restrictions on certain agricultural imports were adopted and some border controls still apply today. If ever needed, a Community mechanism will allow prompt fixing of the maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.  Secondly, there is secondary legislation on emergency planning: there is an obligation that the necessary emergency plans must be drawn up at a national and local level, including inside the facilities, and emergency teams must be in place. Member States must cooperate in emergency planning and in responding to an emergency.  Thirdly, there is secondary legislation on information in cases of radiological emergency: a Community system is in place for the early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency. All Member States, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey participate in that mechanism.  Furthermore, all Member States have established on their territory a network of facilities for monitoring the levels of radioactivity in the environment. It was such equipment in the Nordic countries that detected the Chernobyl accident well before it was revealed by the authorities of the Soviet Union. Informing the population covers advance information to people living close to nuclear installations, as well as protection mechanisms to be provided to the population actually affected by such an emergency.  The European Union has provided financial support for the upgrading of the operating conditions of a number of nuclear installations within the European Union. The reactors where sufficient upgrading could not be carried out will be or have been closed down. The staged closure of the remaining reactors in Ignalina, Bohunice and Kozloduy was agreed in the negotiations for accession to the European Union. They will be closed and we will provide financial support for the countries concerned.  Since  1986 , the European Union has made significant progress particularly in the fields of safety, radiation protection and emergency preparedness.  The Commission would like to thank Parliament yet again for its support of the EU role in nuclear safeguards, as expressed in the resolution of  15 March  2006  on the Lisbon Strategy. This resolution recalls that the EU possesses globally acknowledged expertise in the area of nuclear energy and notes that this expertise relates, inter alia, to the efficiency and quality of production installations and to decommissioning processes. It is also worth recalling that the Council in June  2004  set up a working party on nuclear safety, which is due to produce a final report at the end of this year.  Parliament is also aware that the Commission has made specific legislative proposals intended to provide the Union with common rules on nuclear safety, safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, and decommissioning funds. Furthermore, the Commission will make every effort in the area of research and development to help to find a sustainable solution to the issue of the radioactive waste.  Once again, I wish to thank Parliament for its support and I thank you very much for your attention.
9329968 author: Nancy Jones:  . Mr President, before giving more substantive responses to the questions by Mr Brok, Mr Moscovici and MrVanOrden, I would like to begin by expressing my sympathy for all people affected by the floods that recently hit Bulgaria and Romania and countries falling outside the scope of todays debate, in particular Serbia. I can assure you that the Commission is following the situation with the greatest attention and is ready to offer advice and support in tackling the impact of the floods once the damage has been assessed, as we did last year in the case of Bulgaria and Romania.  Concerning the first question as to whether the rhythm of reform in Bulgaria and Romania is such that they will be ready for accession by January  2007 , the Commission is currently assessing the progress made in both countries and is not yet in a position to confirm the answer to this critical question. As I said to the Committee on Foreign Affairs on  3 April, the Commission will report on developments until the end of April, so the cutoff date is  30 April, the end of this week. The full factual basis will therefore be available in the first two weeks of May. The Commission will then provide an indepth analysis on  16 May, and we will then be ready to discuss our assessment further with the honourable Members of Parliament.  However, let me underline the priority of all priorities. The completion and implementation of judicial reform and concrete results demonstrating that these have a real effect on the ground are of paramount importance for our assessment. Systemic conditions, structural conditions that show that the reforms are irreversible need to be in place. These are the critical yardsticks, since a fully functioning justice system underpins the functioning of the whole of society and the economy in its entirety.  On the basis of our objective and balanced assessment, the Commission will make a proposal on  16 May for a carefully calibrated decision that will maintain the momentum of essential remaining reforms up to and beyond accession of the two countries. I ask for the support of the Parliament and the Council for this rigorous and fair position.  Concerning the second question on the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organised crime, both countries have shown determination to undertake necessary reforms in this field. In Romania we note significant progress, as Romania has continued to pursue the implementation of its legal package of  2005 .  I fully agree with Mr Moscovici that the rigorous monetary mechanism and the safeguard clause of postponement have provided very strong encouragement and an incentive, and these have produced very tangible results in the case of Romania.  In Bulgaria amendments have been made to the constitution, reducing the scope of the immunity of Members of Parliament and establishing the leading function of the prosecution service in most investigations. However, there remains ambiguity concerning the independence of the judiciary and there is a serious backlog in cases related to organised crime. As regards the fight against organised crime in Bulgaria, there are still very few investigations and prosecutions. The competent authorities seem in general to have a reactive instead of a proactive attitude. Therefore, urgent attention is needed in this area. The same is true concerning money laundering in Bulgaria.  Finally, on Mr Broks question concerning the safeguard clauses and monitoring, safeguard clauses are meant to tackle the possible negative consequences that may persist due to shortcomings in Bulgaria and Romania after accession. Safeguards may for instance involve temporarily suspending specific rights under the EU which are directly related to the shortcomings of a new Member State.  A number of safeguards are already provided in existing Community legislation, for instance in the area of food safety or transport. In addition, the accession treaty contains three safeguard clauses: a general economic safeguard clause, a specific internal market safeguard clause and a third one which relates to justice and home affairs. Without going into details of how they can be invoked, by way of example I will take the internal market safeguard, which is specifically designed to deal with cases where a new Member State fails to fulfil commitments made in the accession negotiations. If such a failure causes or risks causing a serious breach in the functioning of the internal market, the Commission may take appropriate measures to deal with that situation, even before accession, with entry into force upon accession. It is important to note that this does not require a unanimous Council decision; it requires a Commission decision based on our objective risk assessment of a candidate countrys possible shortcomings.  It is clear that, in order to have a meaningful system of safeguard clauses, we also need a monitoring mechanism and, in its role as guardian of the treaties, the Commission will assume this duty and will verify the implementation of EU legislation in the two countries.
10118021 author: Marc Reid:  . Mr President, PresidentinOffice, the election victory of Hamas in January presented the European Union with a totally new situation. We supported the Palestinian elections and we also, I have to say, respect the outcome. But the heart of the matter is indeed the emergence of a Palestinian Authority whose government is led by members of an organisation included in the EU terrorist list, and that continues to this day to attempt also to justify, for instance, suicide bombings in Israel.  In January, the Council and the Quartet set out clear principles  that have just been mentioned again  for continued engagement with the Palestinian Authority. I am the first to regret that the new government has so far refused to renounce violence, recognise the right of Israel to exist and accept existing agreements. These principles are indeed the expression of a commitment to work, as we said, for peace by peaceful means. They are not new: they have underpinned our cooperation with the Palestinians for many years. As a result, the Council, meeting two weeks ago as was just mentioned, endorsed the decision of the Commission to temporarily put on hold assistance to or through the Palestinian Government and its ministries.  The Commissions action is a precautionary measure taken to ensure that no Community funds pass into the hands of Hamas. We have taken it pending the possible evolution of the Palestinian Authority position and a definitive decision by the Council on relations with the Palestinian Authority. It is not a definite decision: we are currently reviewing our projects involving payments to or through the Palestinian Authority to see whether we can find alternative solutions. My services have already held a meeting for instance with the office of President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss implementing some of those projects, for instance through the office of the President.  I want to make very clear what this means. We have suspended payments going, as was said, to the Palestinian Government, but we have not suspended aid to the Palestinian people. On the contrary, since the beginning of this year, we have stepped up our aid to the Palestinians. On  27 February, I announced a EUR 120 million package of aid, including help for refugees and help with fuel bills. This means that we committed almost half of our normal years budget in only two months. EUR 100 million of this has already been paid: five times more than we paid for the same period in  2005 .  This represents an acceleration of our aid to the Palestinian people, not a suspension of aid to the people. The Commission is all too aware that the economic, social and humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories is unfortunately getting worse. I have seen the reports from the visits that some Members made to the region in the last few days, and I know you share our deep concern. We will also come forward with further measures to help the population, but we must also be clear on one point: the key to preventing a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories lies with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not with the international community.  I have heard some people say that Europe has been paying the salaries of the Palestinian Authority. This is just not true. Our support to the Palestinian Authority budget in the past has been linked to reform. At most it has covered less than  10  of the salary bill. The real question is that of Israel withholding Palestinian customs and tax revenues. These are Palestinian taxes which people have already paid. Withholding them means that basic services will not be delivered, salaries cannot be paid and families will suffer.  Israel has also increased the closures of territory in the West Bank and into and out of Gaza. Addressing these problems will do more to help the Palestinian people than any measure the EU can take. All of us in the international community have to intensify our diplomatic efforts with Israel on these two issues.  On the Palestinian side, President Abbas has indeed a key role to play, including in negotiating with Israel. We are looking at how we might best support his Office, but we are not in the business of parallel structures. Rather, we are looking with other donors at the possibility of establishing an international supervision mechanism that could facilitate the control of funds for donors to meet needs, for instance in the health and education sectors. The Quartet meeting on  9 May is an opportunity for the international community to address this question, as well as measures Israel could take to ease the humanitarian situation.  I wish to conclude by stressing our wish to see an evolution of the positions taken by the Government of the Palestinian Authority, not its failure. In this way we are looking to address the contradiction between the positions currently espoused by members of the new Palestinian Government and by Hamas as an organisation and the EU objective of a negotiated solution to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, with Israel living sidebyside and at peace with a future Palestinian state based on the  1967  borders.
6052271 author: Sarah Jones:  . Mr President, the European investment fund industry is reinventing itself: crossborder competition is taking root; fund managers and service companies are merging; distribution systems are opening up and new products are being offered to retail investors. Faced with this and with the prospect of profound change, does the UCITS Directive offer an adequate framework for the continued success of the European fund market? This, without a doubt, is a crucial question for policymakers.  Much lipservice has been paid to the need for a vibrant and dynamic asset management business to provide a secure and profitable home for longterm savings of European households. Now is the time to start translating these fine words into action.  The report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is a very incisive and balanced assessment of the main challenges before us. It clearly identifies the challenges that need to be addressed.  The Commission subscribes to the vision that informs Parliaments report, namely to build on the solid foundations laid down by the existing directive and not to jettison product harmonisation. This has served us well to date. We need to try to make it more relevant to context of modern financial markets. The work of the Commission and the Committee of European Securities Regulators on the clarification of eligible assets is vital in this respect. A draft proposal for implementing legislation will soon be communicated to Parliament. This is serious and 25 years. We believe that this is a good compromise. As a result, the Commission can in principle accept the following amendments in the report on geographical indications: Amendments 1 , 10 , 11 , 15 , 25 , 29 and 31 . Of the lastminute amendments tabled for this partsession, the Commission can in principle accept Amendments 41 , 43 , 49 and 54 . In the report on traditional specialities, it can accept Amendments 6 , 10 , 13 and 16 promising work. Let us give it a chance before reading the last rites to product harmonisation.  Beyond better implementation of existing rules, there will be a need to give those involved in the fund industry greater freedom of movement to enable them better to exploit commercial opportunities of the integrated fund market. The emphasis should be on concrete, sensible, targeted changes, based on close contact with the market and informed by a strong commitment to making markets work for the end investor.  Many important improvements can be introduced without taking an axe to the UCITS Directive. The report provides a very clear steer on the areas where change can be most beneficial: simplification of the notification procedure; measures to facilitate crossborder fund mergers and pooling. The onus will now be on the Commission to come forward with solutions. Where legislative adjustment is needed to give effect to new single market freedoms, these changes could incorporate the possibility for adoption of technical implementing measures.  Another theme that features strongly in the report is regulatory arbitrage between different families of investment products. We do not have the full picture yet. We need to recognise the existence of different institutions and risk features. However, we have to monitor carefully how different products are sold to retail investors.  This leads us to the disclosure area. I take note of the strong message from the European Parliament on the simplified prospectus for UCITS. We should not conclude that the experiment has failed and that we should move on. On the contrary, the fund market has become a more diverse and complicated place. There is an even greater need for effective and comparable risk and costs disclosures. We take to heart the strong message of the European Parliament on this issue. We will try to remedy the shortcomings of the simplified prospectus.  Outside the UCITS box, we are looking at some of the new asset classes: private equity and hedge funds. These are increasingly powerful players in European financial markets. They are driving change right across the investment fund industry as traditional fund managers learn from these techniques and strategies. We do not need an EU overlay to national regimes for the oversight of these industries. However, we need a sophisticated regulatory engagement with these important players. We need to understand the context in which they operate and whether there are useful improvements that can be made to help them to operate in the European environment.  How do we move on from here? We will give the fullest consideration to the views set out in Parliaments report. We will critically analyse the forthcoming recommendations of industry expert groups on alternative investments and efficiency enhancements. We will continue to test different scenarios for UCITS revision from a costbenefit perspective and we will reach a firm view on the types of improvement that are most urgently needed. This will be presented in a White Paper to be published in the autumn, accompanied by a comprehensive impact assessment. We will immediately set about translating these ideas into concrete initiatives.  The Commission believes that the UCITS Green Paper and the responses to it  including Parliaments report  have underlined the importance of measured but effective action in this area. This debate and the followup actions have helped to clarify where further action at EU level will be most useful. We are now well poised to begin the task of translating these ideas into effective solutions.
5611506 author: Helen MacLeod:  . Mr President, I have enjoyed the debate. Better targeted state aid for innovation is indeed a core aspect of our state aid reform programme. The Commission will do its utmost to improve framework conditions. We are listening very carefully to stakeholders and your report makes a vital contribution. To put it in Dutch: . That said, next time I will take account of your request in this respect.  I would like to respond to a few issues raised in our debate this evening. Mrs in t Veld asked why we are suggesting a focus on cooperation between companies and between Member States. There are two main reasons: we must encourage this cooperation because it reduces distortions of competition and increases benefits for the Community. The second reason is that we must also encourage improvement of the internal market.  A couple of speakers mentioned the question of large companies eligibility for state aid for innovation, particularly in part of the clusters. I have taken careful note of that. Your comments tie in with what we have heard from other stakeholders including ministers at the informal competition Council meeting last Friday and Saturday.  I am therefore reflecting on the conditions in which such aid may be appropriate. In fact the working paper prepared by my services already includes the possibility of providing aid to large companies as part of clusters. However, I would like to be clear that if we go down this route there will need to be proper checks and balances to prevent distortion of competition and to ensure that the overall effect, for example the benefits generated by collaboration, is positive.  I could not agree more with Mr Hkmarks statements. At the end of the day it is competition that makes the climate, not state aid. Therefore it is an instrument to foster and to bring into a situation where everyone has an opportunity to make his living in a way in which innovation is involved.  Globalisation was touched upon as well  by Mr Casa, Mrs Ferreira, and Mrs Harkin. It is true that our state aid control system is unique in the world. So too is our internal market  our greatest European achievement  and the reason we have state aid control in first place.  I have heard all too often the argument that our state aid rules could reduce investment into Europe as third countries may offer subsidies more liberally than Member States. This argument is based on wrong perceptions. As Mrs in t Veld and Mr Casa said, there are other factors influencing inward investment positions. State aid is far down the list. After general and structural criteria, general political climate, general business environment, red tape, regulation, taxation, closeness to customers, availability of labour, a skilled labour force, availability of resources, availability of the infrastructure: at the end of the list there is sometimes the state aid argument.  With my responsibilities, I have the opportunity to meet quite a number of managers from the business world and when we touch on this item  what is the main issue for you and your company in taking a decision on location?  the other arguments I have just mentioned are far more important. Of course they also add that if there is state aid we will take it, we would be fools if we did not. But it is not the main reason; it is at the end of the list.  Therefore using state subsidies to safeguard European companies is very costly in economic terms and it is often the poorest parts of society that foot the bill.  I am also very wary of arguments that, in the absence of aid, a company will invest outside the EU. This argument presupposes that, if there is an alternative location outside the EU with similar characteristics, the aid will tip the balance. In the absence of such proof, this argument may amount to no more than a bluff. We want real arguments and not bluff.  However, I am ready to look further at whether the new framework could include criteria for assessing the effects of aid granted elsewhere. As you are aware, personally I am not a fan of a matching clause. I have to consider it as an option in response to comments I have heard from several stakeholders and I will look at it, but I am personally not in favour of this instrument.  Mrs Ferreira mentioned the regional dimension and the recent regional aid guidelines, which already provide a flexible instrument to address cohesion issues. There could be a reaction and in this context we introduce the possibility of a new category of aid which can be granted to support startups in addition to regional investment aid.  I am very much in favour of backing and boosting the startups because, as I sometimes mention, when you do not need money the bank is interested in giving you money, and if you are interested in money the bank is not interested in you. Startups in most cases badly need the help of a bank or the guarantee via state aid of obtaining a loan or financial assistance for their activities.  Enterprise aid allows Member States to provide up to EUR  2  million per enterprise in Article  87 ( 3 ) regions and up to EUR  1  million in Article 87 ( 3 )(c) regions. The regional bonus for RampD and innovation would actually undermine our cohesion objective and be counterproductive. If a Member State makes less use of enterprise aid in assisted regions and favours innovation aid, it might put at risk the emergence and reinforcement of a necessary industrial basis, which is a prerequisite for further regional development.  If a Member State grants more aid than necessary as an incentive for industry to carry out a given innovation project, it crowds out private investment and may generate undue windfall profits.  Mrs Harkin raised the types of research and development and innovation activity which state subsidies will target. I would remind you that we have deliberately focused on scope rather than content. Indeed while we can help focus state aid on certain areas of common interest, it is up to Member States themselves to decide a precise project that they would like to support and not for the Commission to dictate this.  The Commission will provide separate notification of the guidelines on aid to environmental protection next year and, in this context, equal innovation will get my full attention.  At the end of the day it is only through a positive partnership and a complete range of proinnovation policies that we will be able to deliver growth in jobs in the European Union. Thank you for your support, thank you for your valuable contribution to this process, and thank you to Mrs in t Veld and her shadow rapporteur for their work.
6420036 author: Nancy Smith:  . Madam President, I want you to imagine a scene: it is a dark and stormy night, it is cold, wet and windy, and you are driving along unfamiliar roads  possibly even lost  when, all of a sudden, something is in your way. You are forced to swerve and you hit a tree, knocking yourself unconscious. At that point, a relatively minor accident could become very serious: you could be in shock, you could develop hypothermia, you could have bleeding which if not stemmed could be fatal. If you are not knocked unconscious, do you know where you are? Do you know anything about the emergency  112  number? Indeed, do you have a mobile phone or is your battery flat? In all of those circumstances a relatively minor accident could be lethal. That is because of what is known as the golden hour principle: if you receive treatment within the first hour you are more likely not only to have your life saved but also to have a reduction in the intensity of injuries.  That is why we need eCall, which is a panEuropean invehicle emergency call system based on the  112  emergency number. If you have an accident, a device within the vehicle will be triggered by the airbag going off, by a sudden rise in temperature in the car, by the car overturning or by sudden deceleration. When it is triggered it will send data  such as the time, location and identification of the vehicle  to a public safety answering point, which will then alert the emergency services who will come rushing to your aid. This device could also be triggered manually and have a voice call so you could communicate with the emergency services.  I know there are some issues about privacy, but let us be clear that this system works only when it is triggered in an accident and is not a device for tracing where you are when you are driving. This came out of the Emerge project, which was funded by the Fifth Framework Programme, and I should emphasise that much of the technology is here now and some cars already have it. However, there is no common platform.  We need this because  40   000  people are killed on our roads every year and  1 . 6  million people are injured. The cost is EUR  160  billion, or  2  of the EUs GDP. We hope to halve the number of deaths by  2010 .  Thus eCall is the first building block in the Commissions Intelligent Car Initiative. Most measures are designed to stop accidents happening, but accidents will inevitably happen and it is in those circumstances that we need eCall. Research has shown that it will reduce the response time in rural areas by  50  and in urban areas by up to  40 . That will save  2500  lives, reduce serious injuries by  15  and so cut roadtraffic accident bills by EUR  22  billion a year. It will also cut accidentrelated congestion by about another EUR  4 billion a year. Therefore, it is a great idea.  Unfortunately, it is a very complicated idea, because a huge range of stakeholders need to come together  the car industry, the telecoms industry, emergency services, public authorities  to get this introduced on a coherent basis on a common platform. That is why the eCall Driving Group was set up. It has produced a Memorandum of Understanding, which binds stakeholders to implement equal and agreed principles and an agreed timetable whereby we will have fullscale tests in  2007 , PSAPs will be upgraded by the end of  2007  and we will introduce this in all new vehicles in  2009 .  We have over  50  signatures, but unfortunately only seven are from Member States and ironically one is from a nonMember State  Switzerland. If there is no commitment to this scheme from the public authorities it will not happen, because the industry cannot justify the research without the commitment of public authorities.  What is needed? We need to publicise  112  as a lot of people do not know about it. This system requires enhanced  112 , which involves caller location. Member States have an obligation to have it under the  2002  directive, but many of them do not. We need to have PSAPs upgraded to deal with this. Many countries are doing that at the moment, but there is still a long way to go.  This will cost money: the device in the car will cost anything from EUR  150  to EUR  450 , but, if done properly, the price will come down. We need the PSAPs to be upgraded. This will cost about EUR  4 . 5  billion a year. However, set against savings of EUR  26  billion, there is a huge cost benefit to this device.  My message to you is quite simple: this is a great device, it will save lives, it will save money, but we need the public authorities to get their finger out and get on with this, because they are the ones who are dragging us back.
256899 author: Helen Bauer:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, MrsPoli Bortone and MrsScheele, for their excellent work and cooperation with my services in working out this compromise. I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contribution.  It is true that it was not an easy task. You will remember the great differences that separated the views of the three institutions on this issue. However, I believe  and the rapporteurs have rightly said  that we have managed to reach a good compromise. That is a fact. However, as with any compromise, it leaves a little to be desired by all sides, so each side would have preferred to go a bit further in one direction or another. Nevertheless, these compromises on both documents have managed to balance the interests of all involved: consumers, industry and economic operators. But this is a delicate and sensitive balance and I believe that the two documents should be adopted as agreed in the compromise, because anything else would upset this balance and would definitely upset the compromise.  These two regulations state that, if economic operators voluntarily use claims or other marketing tools to sell their products, they have to be truthful and accurate and the claims must be scientifically based. This means that it is the consumers choice  it is ultimately for the consumer to decide  but the consumer has to be presented with correct, accurate and scientificallybased information in order to make this informed choice. I agree with the rapporteur that this is a very important step in the longterm struggle that has just begun for the health and nutrition of European citizens.  The health claims regulation will prevent consumers from being misled by unsubstantiated or misleading claims. At the same time, it will provide harmonised rules allowing products to circulate freely in the internal market. It will also create a clear legal environment, a level playing field for economic operators to ensure fair competition, and it will encourage investment in innovative food practices. For example, in addition to the list of permitted nutritional claims or the list of physiological function claims, it will now allow, through an authorisation procedure, claims related to the reduction of a disease risk, something that until now has been prohibited.  So, these harmonised rules will be of great interest to the European food industry but, through the process we have adopted in the legislation, we also guarantee consumer protection. Also, for health claims based on newly developed data, the compromise now provides for a simpler and faster procedure in order to boost innovation in the area of food. I am sure Parliament recognises the effort that both the Commission and the Council have made on that point.  On the nutrient profiles, which have already been described, these are products that, on the basis of the claims, are made to appear better to consumers, encouraging more consumption. We therefore need proper criteria in this respect. The nutrient profile is one good criterion that could be used and the proposed compromise introduces flexibility in order to facilitate the application and use of these claims.  In the context of this compromise, I should like to make the following statement:  In establishing the nutrient profiles referred to in Article  4 ( 1 ) through the Regulatory Committee procedure, the Commission undertakes to accompany the proposed Commission measures, submitted to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with an explanatory note outlining the criteria that will be taken into account for the establishment of the nutrient profiles.  As I have said, I believe that this is a good compromise which covers the interests of all the key stakeholders.  On the regulation concerning the addition of vitamins and minerals, again we have reached a good compromise. On the basis of this compromise, I should like to make the following statement:  Further to its statement accompanying the adoption of the common position, the Commission has the intention to present, as soon as possible and in any case within two years of the adoption of the regulation, a proposal for the revision of Directive  90496 EEC on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs. In that context, the Commission has the intention to consider the review of the rule concerning the meaning of significant amount as mentioned in the Annex to that directive.  I very much hope that Parliament will support this compromise package, which regulates the composition aspects of foods and ensures the safety of the product. It also introduces appropriate specific rules on labelling, presentation and advertising, and at the same time provides the basis for scrutinising and if necessary regulating the addition of certain other substances, as already mentioned by the rapporteur.  That will ensure a very high level of protection for public health and consumer protection and at the same time allow the industry to have a stable, concise, clear regulatory environment that will allow for innovation and the need to remain competitive at Community and international level.  In conclusion, may I again thank the two rapporteurs and everyone else who has cooperated in achieving this compromise. I am looking forward to an interesting debate.
2709839 author: Lynne Finlayson:  . Mr President, I welcome Parliaments report on the Commissions proposal concerning eels and would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Maat, for his good work.  I see that Parliament has taken very seriously the grave threat to the European eel population. Parliament has made a number of helpful and practical suggestions to improve the proposal. I can support many of the amendments as they stand. A number of others I can support in principle, but not their inclusion in the proposal, because they should be dealt with in another way. A small number of other issues require further scientific analysis before they can be implemented practically.  I can accept Amendments  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  6 ,  7 ,  10 ,  12 ,  13 ,  15 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  27  and  29 . I agree that Member States should be able to choose their own closed seasons to reduce fishing effort by  50  and that the timescale of the proposal should be lengthened so that Member States can better develop management plans and have more flexibility in defining the areas to which eel management plans should apply. I also accept that Member States should be able to move forwards individually if difficulties arise in developing management plans in cooperation between several states.  There are several amendments proposed to which I am sympathetic in principle, but which concern issues that I believe should be addressed differently. Amendments  4 ,  8  and  11  concern implementation and further research on the way aquaculture could be involved in improving the stocking of European waters with eels. Research needs cannot be addressed directly in a Council regulation of this type. Funding through the framework programmes and consultation of advisory bodies, such as the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, are more appropriate ways to further research. I will ensure that these more appropriate methods for commissioning research are used. Until the results of the research requested in Amendment  4  are available, it would be premature to proceed with implementation as requested in Amendments  8  and  11 .  Amendments  5  and  25  concern exports of glass eels. This is a trade issue. Once the Community has developed internal conservation measures for eels, the Community could then develop export restrictions that would favour and protect the use of eels for populating Community inland waters. My colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, is aware of this issue and he will begin preparing export measures for glass eels once the Council has taken a decision on eel conservation. In order to ensure compatibility with the World Trade Organization rules, conservation measures within our own waters must be the first step.  Amendment  9  expresses a good idea: migration of glass eels should not be obstructed. However, I consider it would be more in the spirit of the developed approach adopted in this proposed regulation that Member States should make such choices themselves in the context of eel management measures.  Amendment  16  is no longer necessary, because I have accepted that Member States can have flexibility in the definition of eel river basins, as requested in Amendment  13 .  I agree with the principle expressed in Amendment  17 , but the possibility for several Member States to prepare a joint management plan is already covered in Article  8 . Amendments  18  and  28  concern the targets and implementing methods to achieve eel stock recovery. Here I refer to the latest advice of the STECF. This advice tells us that it is extremely difficult to measure eel escapement and that it is preferable to focus on directly applicable measures such as a  50  reduction in the impact on eels due to fishing and a similar reduction in the effect on eels of fixed installations such as turbines and pumps. I believe we should proceed on this basis at present, but Member States should improve and refine data collection concerning eels in order to improve management targets and measures.  Amendments  19  and  20  concern financial aid for restocking and for constructing passes for eels. I support these ideas so long as restocking results in improved silver eel escapement, but as these ideas are to be included in the new European Fisheries Fund regulation, this piece of legislation is not the right place for them.  I can accept that the burden caused by the need for reports should be lightened, as proposed in Amendment  26 , but this could take place through less frequent reports. It is still necessary for Member States to improve substantially the collection of data, so a requirement to improve the scientific basis for eel management is an important part of my proposal.  Amendment  24  suggests extending eel management plans to coastal waters and, in particular, to the Baltic Sea. I agree that management of eel fisheries in coastal areas is important, but it would not be technically feasible at present to apply an escapement target to sea fisheries, because this cannot be measured. Indeed, I will support the inclusion of marine fisheries for eels as fisheries that should be subject to a  50  reduction of general fishing effort.  I thank the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur, Mr Maat, for their very positive cooperation in the preparation of this report. I sincerely hope that, by making a significant and substantial effort in the near future, it will be possible to improve considerably the situation of eel stocks in Europe.
3592182 author: Victor Whittacker:  . Mr President, I am very pleased to refer today to the Commission proposal for a Council regulation concerning the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Community and Morocco. Before outlining the Commissions position on this file, let me first thank the Committee on Fisheries and especially its chairman, Mr Morillon, for his excellent work, and the rapporteur, Mr Varela SuanzesCarpegna, for his report.  As Members know, this agreement marks the renewal of our relations with the Kingdom of Morocco in the fisheries sector after the previous agreement came to an end in November  1999 . The agreement also marks an important step forward towards strengthening our overall relations with Morocco. The agreement marks a new era in fisheries relations between the Union and Morocco. For the first time the Commission has negotiated a fisheries partnership with Morocco, following the principles laid down in the Council conclusions of July  2004 . It prepares the ground for fruitful cooperation between the two parties with a view to achieving sustainable fishing and it will foster a favourable climate for further cooperation in all segments of the fisheries sector.  The new Fisheries Partnership Agreement establishes the basis for a political dialogue between the Community and Morocco in order to identify areas of common interest, thereby taking into account also the particular objectives, needs and opportunities of the Moroccan fishing sector. On this basis, the agreement will contribute to the development of a reasonable fisheries policy in the waters concerned. At the same time, I am convinced that the agreement with Morocco is a very balanced one, which responds to the interests of the Community fleet and in particular the smallscale fleet that was most affected by the terms of the previous agreement.  Six categories of fishing possibilities are covered by the agreement. Four of them are smallscale fisheries, small pelagic vessels in the north, bottom longliners, smallscale vessels in the south, and poleandline tuna vessels. A category of demersal fisheries is also included, as well as industrial pelagic fisheries, which is limited to a quota of  60000  tonnes of catches per year.  The protocol sets the financial contribution at EUR 36 . 1 million per year. A substantial part of this amount  EUR  13 . 5  million  is earmarked for support measures in view of the implementation of a sustainable and reasonable fisheries policy.  The agreement has been concluded for a period of four years and contains a number of elements on which the partnership approach is based. They include, amongst other things, an exclusivity clause which prohibits the existence of private licences or other private arrangements outside the scope of the agreement; scientific cooperation in order to promote responsible fishing in Moroccan fishing zones; the possibility of a review of the fishing opportunities on the basis of scientific evidence and within the limits required by the sustainable management of Moroccos resources; vessel monitoring system requirements to reinforce checks on vessels operating in Moroccan fishing zones; and the social clause applicable to local seamen signed on by Community vessels.  I am confident that this agreement will be implemented in the best possible way and in the spirit of partnership, dialogue and remarkable mutual respect that has characterised our relations with the Kingdom of Morocco since the beginning of the negotiations.  At this point allow me to turn briefly to the amendments. Although the Commission can agree with the spirit of certain amendments, such as Amendments  2 ,  5 ,  7 ,  10  and  13 , it does not consider them necessary. Similarly it does not consider Amendment  4  necessary, and it cannot accept Amendments  1 ,  3 ,  6 ,  8 ,  9 ,  11  or  12 .  On Amendments  14  to  18 , the question of the ECMorocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the related question of Western Sahara have been discussed at great length, in the European Parliaments Fisheries Committee, as well as in the Committee on Development and the Committee on Budgets.  I would like to emphasise again that the agreement is fully in conformity with international law. This has also been confirmed by the opinion of the European Parliaments Legal Service, and the legal services of the Commission and the Council. The content of the agreement does not contain any provision dealing with the legal status of the maritime waters pertaining to Western Sahara. It defines the Moroccan fishing zone as the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco. This neither defines nor prejudges the legal status of the waters concerned. According to the provisions of the agreement, it is up to the Moroccan authorities as the contracting party concerned to define the fishing zones on the basis of which fishing licences will be issued.
7636741 author: Lynne Finlayson:  Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Varela SuanzesCarpegna for his opening remarks. I fully understand the points raised regarding monitoring and I have no difficulty with keeping the Committee on Fisheries informed of how the agreement is actually implemented. I fully share the concern to keep Parliament informed of the various aspects of the implementation of the protocol. I would like to underline that the Commission already complies with the requirements on the transmission of information, in line with the current institutional arrangements. We have also continued discussions with the chairman and members of the Committee on Fisheries in order to try to improve the existing exchange of information and dialogue, in particular with regard to the conclusion and the expost followup to the conclusion of fisheries agreements.  Concerning the points raised by Mrs Fraga Estvez, in particular with regard to cephalopods and crustaceans, I would like to underline that Article  4  of the protocol provides for reviewing the fishing possibilities under the agreement if the scientific reports indicate an improvement of the situation of certain stocks. On the basis of the conclusions of the annual Scientific Committee meetings, the two parties can agree jointly to modify the existing fishing possibilities as long as sustainable management of the resource is ensured.  The fishing possibilities established in the agreement reflect the total amount of available species, as recommended by the scientific report, and the capacities of the Moroccan national fleet. The Commission does not intend to reopen discussion on this issue except within the parameters of Article  4 . Also, with regard to the point raised concerning modalities, the modalities referred to are certainly important but let me emphasise that these are technical questions that by their nature are not defined in the agreement.  Technical modalities such as the use of lamparo, the number of hooks for longliners and the issue of landings for industrial pelagic fishery will be finetuned during the first Joint Committee meeting that will be convened after the entry into force of the agreement, and we certainly have no problem with keeping Parliament and the sector fully informed. Information could be given on technical modifications during our regular closed session meetings. The next one is foreseen for  21  June and if by then we have already had contact with the Moroccans, we will certainly report back to the Committee on Fisheries on the outcome of those contacts.  I was asked by Mrs Fraga Estvez how far Morocco has proceeded with regard to concluding the process of adoption of the agreement. Our information is that everything is moving smoothly. We do not know of any particular difficulties on the Moroccan side. It should therefore be adopted by the Moroccan Parliament immediately after we have adopted it some time in June.  I would like to thank all those who have expressed support for the agreement reached. Regarding the point raised by Mrs Corbey concerning the exante evaluation, let me say that it was sent in September to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and distributed to all members of the Committee on Fisheries.  As regards the points raised by Mrs Attwooll and a number of others, I repeat that concerning Western Sahara the wording used in the agreement was formulated very carefully. I repeat that it neither defines nor prejudges the legal status of the waters concerned. Again, with regard to what Mr Schlyter, Mr Hudghton, Mr Guerreiro and others said on the question as to whether Morocco can conclude agreements that concern the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara, the United Nations legal adviser gives a clear answer. Although the United Nations has never recognised Morocco as an administrative power in accordance with Article  73  of the Charter of the United Nations, and Morocco is not listed as an administering power of the territory in the United Nations list of nonselfgoverning territories  this is point  7  of the Opinion of the United Nations legal adviser  agreements can be concluded with the Kingdom of Morocco concerning the exploitation of natural resources of Western Sahara.  The interpretation given by the UN legal adviser recognises the competence of Morocco to conclude these types of agreements and in this way implies that Morocco is a de facto administrative power of the territory of Western Sahara; the mandate given to the Commission by the Council was to negotiate with the Kingdom of Morocco.  In the framework of these agreements, international law seeks to assure the right of peoples and nations to use and dispose of the natural resources in their territories. In that respect, the agreements are considered compatible with the Charter obligation of the administering power and in conformity with the General Assembly resolution and the principle of permanent sovereignty of natural resources enshrined therein, if the exploitation of the resources in nonselfgoverning territories is considered for the benefit of the peoples of those territories, on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives. In that respect, Morocco is under an obligation to take all appropriate measures to ensure the full application of the ECMorocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement in accordance with the obligations of international law.  May I say in response to Mrs Sudres and MrKristensens concerns that the agreement itself already guarantees certain benefits for the local population. In particular with regard to industrial pelagic fishery, which is focused on stock C, the agreement foresees the obligation to land  25  of captures. The main purpose of this provision is to contribute to the better supply of pelagic fish to the transformation industry that has in recent years suffered from irregular and short supplies of raw material. Additional economic incentives are therefore foreseen to encourage pelagic vessels to land a bigger part of their catches, more than the obligatory  25 , in the local ports in the south.  In addition to the abovementioned landing obligation, the agreement also makes stipulations regarding services and infrastructure activities in the local ports in the south. That provides for additional earnings and contributes to development of these ports. The agreement also ensures additional support for the development of the coastal area through the following financial measures. The agreement sets an amount of at least EUR  4 . 75  million per year for the modernisation and upgrading of the coastal fleet. The agreement also specifies that part of the financial contribution should be used, among others, for the restructuring of smallscale fishing, training and support of professional organisations. The industrial pelagic fishery is under the obligation to land  25  of all catches in the local ports. This obligation has been inserted into the agreement in order to support the development of the local fishing industry, which suffers from an irregular or insufficient supply of raw material.
9226513 author: Lynne Cameron:  . Mr President, it is not a question of my timetable, but of media deadlines in Bulgaria and Romania. I trust you will be sympathetic to this excuse, because we have to get the right message across tonight to both Bulgaria and Romania, where we are heading with President Barroso immediately after this sitting to pass on the message of encouragement. We shall be rolling up our sleeves to tackle the remaining shortcomings.  I would like to thank you for a very constructive and responsible debate, which also reflects the wide range of views in European civil society. That is, of course, the role of Parliament.  In this debate I sense overall support for the Commissions basic approach, which is that the target accession date of January  2007  should be possible, on condition that the countries can address the remaining shortcomings. Yes, some are more in favour than others and opinions differ as to the conditions, but the overall tone of the debate has been very clear and I can say that the Commission is in favour of the target and of sticking strictly to the conditions.  In order to have a real dialogue, I would like to comment on the points raised in various speeches. First of all, it has been said that the conditions that remain must be achievable. I fully agree with that. We would not propose a final review of whether the conditions have been met in October if we did not believe that it is feasible for the countries to meet the remaining criteria.  At the same time, it is clear that, as guardian of the treaties, we cannot recommend something that does not exist. We have to see that the conditions are really fulfilled, especially in the field of terrorism and the fight against corruption and organised crime. Otherwise, we would not be up to our task.  Secondly, there has been a request for a concrete todo list or scoreboard for the countries so that they know what is expected of them. I agree. This is included in the Commissions report and both countries are fully aware of the expectations and of the remaining criteria. That is precisely why President Barroso and I are going to Bucharest and Sofia today and tomorrow. We shall discuss what is expected of both Bulgaria and Romania.  Moreover, we have to trust in the political maturity of the governments, parliaments and administrations of these countries for them to know what the Copenhagen political and economic criteria and the criteria mean, and plan their roadmaps of reform on the basis of these wellestablished criteria, which form the basis of our crystal clear report.  I can give you a very precise example of one area in which we and Bulgaria and Romania have an interest in the countries fulfilling the conditions by the accession date, and that is that Community money should be properly spent and accounted for, which, I trust, is close to the heart of this House  at least it was when I was a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Bulgaria needs to establish the integrated administration and control system in agriculture in order to implement the provisions and funding of the common agricultural policy. This means that it needs to take aerial photographs of all the parcels of land, digitise them and block them into a system that links them to the owners. If this is not done, I am afraid we will have to withhold direct payments under the common agricultural policy. This should work as a very strong incentive to redress this shortcoming. I hope this example is concrete enough, but I could give you dozens of other precise examples of what still needs to be done in various areas of the Unions policy and .  Finally, Mr Van Orden said that no reference was made in the Commissions report to the recommendation of a possible postponement, which is one of the provisions of the accession treaty. To avoid any confusion or misunderstanding, this compels me say that in fact, in the conclusion of the Commissions report adopted just three hours ago, we say that by early October we shall assess whether the two countries have been able to address the remaining shortcomings and on that basis we shall adopt a position as to whether the proposed accession date can be adhered to. This means, in clear English or other Community languages, that the Commission reserves the right to consider the use of this safeguard clause of postponement unless the shortcomings are addressed in the next five months, which is, as I said, fully achievable for both countries if they really make an effort.  Our goal is the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in  2007  and our duty is to see that both countries join when they meet the conditions and are fully prepared to join the European Union. This is also a matter of the famous absorption capacity of the European Union. That is the best way to make the enlargement a success for Bulgaria, Romania and Europe. I trust that you will support the Commission in this objective.
2861011 author: Alastair McNabb:  . I think this will be rather a long answer because it cannot be answered in just a few sentences.  I would like to start by saying that today Russia plays a very important role in securing Europes energy supplies. Currently Russia provides almost  30  of the EUs oil imports and  45  of our gas imports. Or, to be more exact,  25  of our consumed gas. As a result, Russia is the largest single external energy supplier.  A considerable amount of our Iranian imports are also provided by Russia, so the EU and Russian markets for crude oil and oil products, as well as natural gas, are tightly interlinked with numerous pipelines, maritime and rail links and numerous contracts that our companies have concluded with Russian suppliers.  A broad relationship and energy dialogue was established between Russia and the Commission in  2000 . Moreover, the common economic space agreed during the EURussia Summit in May 2005  includes cooperation in a wide range of energyrelated activities. So the energy dialogue aims to discuss issues related to energy policy and market developments, infrastructure developments, and EURussia cooperation in multilateral energy fora. I believe that Russia will remain an important supplier for the EU in the future.  Taking into account the expected growth of energy consumption in the EU, I expect Russia to continue to supply around  25  of the gas consumed in the EU which, in absolute terms, would mean an increase in supplies. The European Union and many countries worldwide are becoming ever more dependent on imported hydrocarbons. I would like to reiterate that in the long term there are only three countries that have a lot of natural gas resources: Russia, Iran and Qatar. At the same time, the EU will import  70  of its energy in  2030 , compared with  50  today.  Over time, the remaining fossil fuel resources will become more concentrated, as I said, in a rather small number of countries. As a consequence, energy interdependence is becoming a global issue, with major shared concerns, such as increased demand for limited resources in the world, the lack of investment in new production and the climate change issues.  Therefore, a broad range of actions at EU and MemberState level are required to address these challenges. It has been highlighted in the Green Paper. I have just highlighted one of the actions in my answer to the honourable Members previous question about biofuels. That is one of the actions that we indicate.  The Green Paper emphasised opportunities, such as policies to improve first of all energy efficiency and energy savings, as well as enhancing the market penetration of renewable energy sources. It also highlighted external policy options, such as strengthening the framework for energy relations between the EU and Russia in order to give more confidence to both sides, as well as policies and measures to diversification of the geographical sources and transportation routes of external energy supplies to the EU.  In this context, it is important to underline that the EU is making continuous efforts to improve energy relations with other energyproducing organisations  such as OPEC, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the countries of the Caspian Basin and north Africa  as well as with the consuming regions in the framework of the International Energy Forum, the International Energy Agency, G 8  and through bilateral agreements and dialogues.  This policy of diversification is not directed against our current suppliers: it is a necessity dictated by the global energy security challenges and by the challenge posed by global warming and other environmentrelated issues.  Together with the Austrian Presidency of the European Union, I recently sent a letter to the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Khristenko, on the issue of energy cooperation and in particular gas interdependency. In this letter we reiterated the importance the EU attributes to deepening energy relations with Russia, the EUs most important energy supplier. Furthermore, we stressed that the importance the EU attaches to diversifying sources of supply should not be interpreted as limiting deliveries of Russian gas to the EU market, particularly as demand for gas in Europe is forecast to rise.  In this relationship with Russia, the EU is promoting such principles as market reciprocity, fair transit conditions through Russia and thirdparty access to infrastructure in Russia. Therefore, the short answer to the questions that have been asked is that we are looking for diversification, but it is extremely important to establish measures on the demand side, because only with demandside measures, energy efficiency and savings can we actually establish our energy independence more strongly and, at the same time, look towards our goals of sustainability and competitiveness.
5009225 author: Annette Brown:  Madam President, in  2001 , during the BSE and CJD scares and outbreaks, the Commission implemented a temporary ban on feed of animal and fish origin being fed to ruminants, pending thorough scientific risk assessment of the regulation. In accordance with the precautionary principle and as a measure to promote consumer confidence, a policy of zero tolerance of processed animal proteins and meat and animal bonemeal in animal feed was put in place. And although no case of TSE in fish had ever been discovered, the feeding of fishmeal to ruminants was also subjected to a temporary ban. This initial sixmonth ban has been extended on a rolling basis ever since, despite a categorical Commission announcement in  2004  that there was no risk of TSE occurrence, let alone transmission, from fishmeal fed to ruminants and that the policy of zero tolerance of meat and bone spicules in animal feed should be lifted.  The Commission argued that this zero tolerance policy could not be implemented, since the technical detection methods for identifying processed animal protein had not previously been sufficiently accurate to take account of the socalled adventitious presence of small amounts of protein from small birds, mammals and rodents accidentally caught in the harvesting process.  The impossibility of distinguishing these proteins and bone spicules, which do not pose a TSE risk from proteins of ruminant origin which could contain BSEcarrying prions, resulted in a number of highprofile, extremely costly, wasteful and unnecessary withdrawals from shipments and, more controversially, beetbased animal feed, owing to this harmless and unavoidable adventitious presence of nonruminant proteins.  The proposal before us is intended to amend and update the regulation. In particular, the categorisation of countries according to existing BSE risk, surveillance and monitoring, specified risk material, giving a permanent legal basis for breeding programmes for resistance to TSEs, giving Member States the option to keep BSE cohort animals in their herd and of course revising the feedback.  Given the protracted uncertainty that the failure to come to a decision on lifting the feed ban has caused to farmers and industry, I sincerely hope that this dossier will be adopted at first reading. I welcome the compromise reached and support the provisions relating to the possible lifting of the feed ban, because the provision is based on sound science. I believe that there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect all interests. Furthermore, I feel it is important to underline that protein is a necessary component of animal diets and the current feed ban is placing us in a precarious position regarding protein supply for animal diets. In Europe, we are only  23  selfsufficient in proteins. Most of our higher quality proteins, for example Brazilian soya, are shipped vast distances from countries where the sustainability debate is now raging.  While there is a debate on the ethics about how animals are being fed, it must be borne in mind that the alternatives sometimes pose even bigger ethical questions. The fact remains that the food industry in the EU is protein deficient. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on feeding fishmeal to young calves that have high protein requirements. We cannot be driven by emotion; otherwise our credibility as legislators will be severely undermined. Scientific rigour is at the core of this regulation. We should respect the undisputed scientific consensus that fishmeal poses no risk of TSE.  In conclusion, as regards setting the tolerance thresholds for adventitious presence of bone spicules and technically unavoidable contamination, it is imperative that we apply scientific rigour through standing committees under the comitology procedure. This procedure is not perfect, but it is more responsive than codecision and ensures informed scientific analysis and risk assessment, rather than risking emotive concerns guiding European decisions in technical areas.  For this reason, I cannot support Amendment  57 , which I believe would threaten the chances of reaching a hardwon first reading agreement in the interests of all concerned. But having said this, as parliamentarians, we should exercise fully and vigilantly our right to scrutinise the outcomes of comitology meetings and to hold the Commission to account when their standing committee experts decisions exceed the powers conferred on them by the TSE regulation.  Madam President, may I send my best wishes to MrsRothBehrendt for a speedy recovery and thank her for her longterm interest in this important issue. Thank you for your patience.
62180 author: Marc Corless:  . Mr President, the job of the European Parliament is to scrutinise and hold to account the institutions of the European Union, yet every year since  1988  in this Parliaments annual human rights report, we have scrutinised the record of governments across the world, but never asked the hard questions about what impact the EU itself has had in promoting compliance with international human rights law abroad. This year we are doing so.  I would like to thank colleagues from the Austrian Presidency who have agreed with us an enhanced role for Parliament, as the Council prepares its annual human rights report on behalf of the Union as a whole. This is not so much a question of institutional sensitivities: it is more that a unified and strengthened EU human rights report can provide a stronger voice for Europe and our commitment to human rights in the world. I hope our proposal for an annual EU list of countries of concern will be considered in that context.  I would like to thank the Commissioner, too, for her support for this approach and for listening and responding to Parliament by agreeing to a separate legal instrument for human rights. This will allow us to continue funding human rights projects, despite opposition from governments responsible for oppression and abuse. It is the right choice.  Of course Parliament will, this year and every year, offer constructive criticism. Why does the Council support UN reform which puts human rights onto an equal footing, yet itself have a parttime working group, compared to other foreign policy working groups which are staffed by permanent Brusselsbased officials? Human rights are not a parttime occupation. When UN troops in Liberia stand accused of rape and torture, how can Europe launch its own ESDP mission in Aceh, Indonesia, without any human rights monitoring? Why do the EUs human rights consultations allow Russia to exclude human rights NGOs and why does our human rights dialogue with China not even benefit from simultaneous language interpretation? And does Europe really apply human rights consistently when it fails to support criticisms of the abuse in both China and Russia, but is prepared to do so for less strategically important countries like Nepal or North Korea?  Explain to the families of  99  trade unionists murdered last year in Colombia, which has the worst record in the world, why Europe actually offers trade preferences to that country for its supposed protection of internationally agreed workers rights. Why have nine Member States, including Germany, Ireland, and Portugal, failed to sign the UN optional protocol against torture? Eleven EU countries refuse to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, including Britain, France and Spain.  Why have seven of our members considered signing socalled immunity agreements in opposition to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court? When human rights defenders face death threats for upholding their rights, how can evidence show that in Zimbabwe  scene of political imprisonment, mass evictions and the persecution of journalists  the European Commission delegation itself said that it was not aware of the EUs guidelines for human rights defenders? We can do better.  We must stop the navelgazing by EU representatives in international forums and, for the first time, genuinely link multilateral and bilateral negotiations in the EU so that abusive countries know they will face adverse consequences in the EUs diplomatic trade and development policies.  We must use a more sophisticated sliding scale of sanctions and make it easier to find political agreement in the EU to apply them. We should ensure that one staff member in every Commission delegation, in  118  countries worldwide, is responsible for reporting and promoting human rights obligations. We must make the UN and its international human rights conventions a contractual obligation of the stabilisation, association and accession process, starting with ourselves.  Finally, as far as we ourselves are concerned, let me refer to the debate raging this week in my own country, the United Kingdom, on how human rights can be reconciled, given the changed threats of terrorism, people trafficking and organised crime. It is time to say that the threats might change, but that human rights are inviolable.  When the last generation saw Nelson Mandela labelled a terrorist, when former East Germans smuggled themselves across the Berlin Wall, when the Holocaust represented one of the worst ethnic genocides in world history, the threats of terrorism, trafficking and racial hatred were a cue to agree human rights, not to tear them down. So if our generation is sincere in seeking the freedom of political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi, tackling the despicable trade in women and children for sexual exploitation and bringing the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Darfur and in the Balkans to justice, we have to defend the concept of human rights at home as well as abroad. Europe must practice what it preaches.
8942733 author: Alastair Bush:  . Mr President, let me begin on a personal note: this is my third opportunity to speak in this House about the broad issues of human rights. As far as the Austrian Presidency is concerned, this issue is very dear to our hearts and we want to deal with it in a way that corresponds to what the rapporteur has just said. We want the European Union as a whole to be perceived by our partners and by the outside world as speaking with one voice and conveying the values of the European Union. As MrHowitt said, we have to practise what we preach. This is very much what the Presidency is trying to do.  I should like to begin by thanking the European Parliament for its cooperation and we should also like to thank the Commissioner and the Commission for their contributions.  We are grateful this year that, for the first time, Parliament has adopted a comprehensive approach. It has not just listed one human rights violation after another in a given country but has adopted a comprehensive approach and policy, which the Council very much appreciates.  To those  be they women or men  who are threatened and tortured for standing up for human rights, it is irrelevant whether the European Union now speaks through Parliament, the Council or the Commission. The important thing is that we in the European Union should speak at all. People who rely on help from the European Union do so irrespective of the institution, and that is why cooperation between the institutions is so very important.  I would like, at this point, to make reference to something that is very important to me personally, even though it may well not be directly connected with the report. The Austrian Presidency is endeavouring, if at all possible, to set up the Fundamental Rights Agency, and to bring about a final agreement on it, before our presidency comes to an end. We had, this morning, a highly constructive sitting with Parliament and the Commission, in the course of which we agreed on the basis outlines of what this Fundamental Rights Agency is going to be like. I would ask you all to play your parts in this, in order that this important institution, which is to represent the European Union as a whole to the outside world, may take concrete form as soon as possible. The Presidency will be working very hard to that end.  We have closely examined the report, and we are appreciative of the efforts of the rapporteur and of all the Members of your House who worked on it. I would just like to give particular attention to a few points. The first has to do with the human rights guidelines, which the report quite rightly emphasises, and which is of great significance in terms of the more effective implementation of EU policy. At the heart of all that we do is the worldwide abolition of the death penalty and of torture, along with the protection of human rights activists and of children caught up in armed conflict, and I would like to mention the fact that Austrian foreign policy over recent years, not least under the aegis of MrsFerreroWaldner  who is now a Commissioner  focused particularly on these issues.  We welcome your Houses work, in particular that of the Human Rights SubCommittee, towards the better implementation of the antitorture guidelines and also your timehonoured commitment to the prevention of human rights violations. The present Austrian President of the Foreign Affairs Council, MrsPlassnik, takes these matters extremely seriously; in the runup to the summit between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean, she received human rights campaigners from that region and assured them of the European Unions support.  Passing on to the subject of the antitorture guidelines, we repeatedly hear it said that the European Union does not do enough in individual cases. We are of course well aware of the fact that whether or not people detained in police custody are treated humanely is often something that is determined within hours, and, true though this is, we must also be honest with ourselves and admit the regrettable fact that our options are often limited. Within the scope afforded by those options, the European Union does speak out very strongly in cases where people face the threat of torture and inhumane treatment, but we regret our inability to prevent them in every case.  The implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture, and cooperation with the UNs human rights apparatus generally, was, during our presidency, an essential part of our human rights policy; in this respect we were doing no more than continuing the European Unions traditional policy, and initiated dmarches on the subject in over twentyfive countries.  The subject of torture and inhumane treatment is of course an important one, and it is one that we keep on raising in our human rights dialogues with third countries. Having visited Kazakhstan, where we engaged in political dialogues with the countries of Central Asia, and more recently, the region of the Southern Caucasus, I myself can say that the European Union has always been very forthright in addressing the issue of torture and inhumane treatment, as well as human rights matters in general.  Elections to the UN Human Rights Council were held a matter of a few days ago, and I am sure that we can generally be satisfied with them, since it turned out that certain states who are notorious violators of human rights were not elected after all, and the European Union had in fact given an undertaking not to vote for countries known to have a poor record on human rights.  The Human Rights Council will meet for the first time on  19 June, in other words, before the end of our presidency. Our desire is that this new United Nation body should, in future, make a constructive and essential contribution to working for human rights around the world.  In conclusion, I would like once more to emphasise the great importance of exchange between the institutions in terms of our work for human rights. Only an evenhanded and universal human rights policy on the part of the European Union will get a hearing and, eventually, bear fruit.  The presentation of the European Unions annual report on human rights to your House in December, an occasion on which you traditionally highlight human rights priorities by presenting the Sakharov Prize, and your Houses response to that report, makes an important contribution towards that end.  Our common goal is an effective and visible human rights policy for the European Union, which will see us standing up for our values. The European Parliament is making a significant contribution in this respect, to which tribute was paid in the European Unions annual report for  2005 . The European Parliaments achievements should and will receive due recognition in the forthcoming annual report, which will be prepared under the Finnish Presidency. I would like, once again to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for this outstanding report.
8011419 author: Christoph Jones:  . Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity for a human rights debate. I thank Mr Howitt for his excellent report. I also welcome the comprehensive analysis of action. As the President said, both the Commission and the Council have to work very closely together in order to have a comprehensive human rights policy. Let me make a few comments and raise a few issues.  First, I acknowledge the strong support of Parliament for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and its continued interest. I assure you that all the elements that contribute to the success of this initiative will be maintained for the period  2007  to  2013 , for instance independence from government approval and support for civil society organisations. I share the concern to make our actions in the area more flexible and in tune with the needs of the grassroots organisations. This year we are already trying out concrete improvements in our procedures, notably in the calls for proposals. We also need to better adapt the programme to the sensitive situations and restrictions often faced by civil society organisations. I will certainly continue to rely on your support to carry through those changes.  Secondly, I am grateful for the recognition of the effectiveness of the EU electionmonitoring activities. They clearly demonstrate the commitment of the European Union to the democratic process and the sustainable resolution of conflicts. That is clearly reflected in the significant increase in the number of observation missions over the last two years, particularly in postconflict and transition situations. The professional and independent approach of EU electoral observers is highly regarded and enjoys credibility and leverage. I am sensitive to the need to ensure that any further increase in that area does not squeeze resources from other priorities and I can assure you that I will do my best in that regard.  Thirdly, I welcome your positive comments on the human rights work of the EU in multilateral fora. Great efforts go into consolidating EU positions in such fora, which are often instrumental in achieving progress. As the President has already said, that leadership role of the European Union was clearly visible in the negotiations establishing the Human Rights Council. I should like to pay tribute to the Austrian Presidency, which capably steered through somewhat difficult waters.  Now that elections to the Council have taken place, the real work of this new body at the helm of the international and human rights system begins. I am confident that it will prove more efficient than the old Commission on Human Rights.  Fourthly, I should like to pay tribute to the work leading to the report on gender equality and womens rights. The mainstreaming of womens as well as childrens rights remains a priority for this Commission and for me personally. The ongoing work on a comprehensive communication on childrens rights encompassing the internal, as well as the external, affairs of EU action is testimony to that.  I welcome the recommendations made by the rapporteur on the format of this and future reports. I hope that it will be possible to make the  2006  EU Human Rights Report a truly interinstitutional report. In that respect, my services have already suggested to the Member States that, as suggested by Parliament, the  2006  report should include a section on human rights guidelines, more emphasis on the use and impact of human rights clauses, and it should also aim to cover the activities of all three institutions  the Council, the Commission and Parliament.  That should not in any way be interpreted as impinging on the prerogatives of Parliament to scrutinise the work of the Council and Commission. But there will be space and need for a separate report by Parliament on the European Unions human rights policy.  I agree with Mr Howitt that a reinforced effort should be made by the European Union as a whole to address human rights concerns more systematically and to mainstream human rights considerations in EU policies. In that task, cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is crucial. You can be sure that we are a partner in it.
6918941 author: Roger LaCourt:  . Mr President, before going into the substance I would like to welcome the presence of the Commission and the Council. I particularly appreciate the efforts of successive presidencies to find a solution to the outstanding problems linked to the original Commission proposal on the DCECI.  When debating this instrument, our overriding concern must be the interests of the developing countries, and in particular the poorest sections of their populations. The remit of the Committee on Development is to represent their interests at European Union level and to ensure that they are kept on the EUs political agenda. That is why we argue in favour of a specific instrument for the needs of the developing countries, namely poverty alleviation with true economic cooperation and sustainable development, and not just a default instrument for all countries not covered by any other instrument. I believe that this view is now widely accepted and I hope that the Commission now accepts it also.  This Parliament obviously shares the Commissions desire for greater efficiency, simplification and flexibility in the legislative domain, but cannot allow this to happen at the expense of its own competences and of democracy itself. Parliament essentially exercises its competences in the policy domain at three levels: determination of political priorities  which means codecision at policysetting level, monitoring implementation, and budgetary powers.  Those three levels are complementary and Parliament, being the only institution directly elected by the European citizens, should strive to have a greater say in all three of them. We should not, however, accept an increase in parliamentary powers at one level at the expense of our existing powers at another level. Codecision is not negotiable. Parliament fought for many years to get it and it is now enshrined in the Treaty.  I am pleased to hear the Commissioners assurances on codecision here today. May I say to the Presidency that the difference with the DCECI is that it seeks to replace  16 codecided regulations with one regulation. I am absolutely amazed that the Commission and Council can so easily agree on taking away the role of Parliament. We should also not permit the human rights instrument, which Parliament has consistently been calling for, to be used to make us relinquish our policysetting powers. Human rights are too important to be used as a bargaining chip in interinstitutional negotiations.  The ball is now in the Commissions court. My proposal to make the Development Cooperation Instrument the single administrative and procedural regulation for development cooperation not only gives the Commission the administrative simplification and flexibility it seeks, but also ensures that policy implementation is kept apart from the unpredictability of political life. Priorities may change rapidly, according to our political agendas and those of our partners, but a procedural regulation will ensure that implementation can go on unhindered.  As rapporteur on the DCECI, I am fully determined to continue the intensive work that has gone into it and to ensure that it is in place as a procedural regulation well before the end of the year. Now that the Commission has recognised that the policy content for development cooperation must be established by codecision, it is time for it to submit formal legislative proposals on geographical and thematic priorities, so that Parliament and Council can finally start the process of legislating. Both the geographical and the thematic content are close to the heart of the European Parliament and require a thorough debate.  We are talking about priorities for our cooperation with Latin America, the Middle East, Central Asia, the Far East and South Africa; our priorities in the fields of human and social development; sustainable management of natural resources such as water and energy; the environment and the role of nonState actors. These require a full and proper debate in Parliament. Since we know that the debate on such vast and sensitive issues will be difficult and the time is now running out, I want to inform the Council and the Commission that the Committee on Development is setting up a working group to discuss the policy content. This will speed up negotiations within Parliament and with the other institutions once we have received formal proposals.  As I said at the beginning, we are talking about cooperation with hundreds of millions of poor people in the world. They need our continued support. For that, we need a legal base. It is up to the Commission to propose it in time. I welcome the tone and content of the Commissioners contribution here today, but there is a lot of work to be done and I hope we will soon get down to doing it.
9213016 author: Helen Green:  . Mr President, I am not sure I have ever enjoyed such largesse of time before in this House, but I am glad it is in the company of a select club!  I wish to begin by expanding on the objects of our two questions to the Council and to the Commission. I should emphasise that they are questions  although it is gratifying to see my name on them, the questions are on behalf of my committee.  I am very pleased to see that the Presidency is able to be present after all. I appreciate that this may have caused inconvenience, but holding this debate at this time presents some inconvenience to me as well: I could be elsewhere consuming asparagus.  Because the Council has changed the original Commission proposal with regard to the role of the European Parliament from the consultation procedure to simply informing Parliament of any decision of the Council, I am bound to ask why the Council appears to be trying to bypass or circumvent Parliament. What could the Council have to hide? In the context of the apparent reluctance to be present here tonight, the substance of our question has added relevance. Therefore, allow me to remind the Council representative, Mr Winkler, of our two specific questions.  The first is: what mechanism would the Council envisage for informing of Parliament prior to the adoption of a position by the Council with regard to the Energy Community Treaty institutions? Secondly, by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the representatives of the European Community in the organs of the Energy Community Treaty, such as the Permanent High Level Group? Before the House is invited to vote on the recommendation on the Energy Community Treaty tomorrow, we need some answers and assurances from the Council on these points, and I and others will be listening carefully.  Because this is a very important matter, the proposed Treaty creates an interesting precedent in extending the in a limited and very specific field to third countries, albeit that two of them should be joining the European Union very shortly or others are in various stages of negotiating accession.  It is also important because energy is currently perceived as a very important issue, largely as a result of events at the beginning of this year. Those events were rather like throwing a large stone into a pond, creating ripples. Energy is vital to our way of life, vital to our quality of life and vital to our standard of living, so how we organise markets and safeguard security of supply is equally important.  Turning to the question to the Commission, I should like to acknowledge from the outset the high level of cooperation and the positive response to our concerns that we have received from Commissioner Piebalgs. Indeed, I welcome his open and constructive approach in meetings and in the recent letter with regard to the issues of informing Parliament about the activities of the Energy Community and addressing some of the concerns of my committee over social and human rights issues. I trust that the Council will endorse his offer to inform Parliament in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues. I welcome his letters assertion that he considers it of the utmost importance that Parliament is fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community.  Now I come to the specific points contained in our questions to the Commission, which I feel still require a response. The Council decision on the conclusion of the Energy Community Treaty lays down in its Article  4 ( 3 ) the provisions for providing mutual assistance in the event of disruption  see the Treatys Title IV, Chapter IV. Yet the same article of the decision stipulates that: in the event of special circumstances the position of the European Community may go beyond the . So the first question is: what might these special circumstances be? The second question is: what is meant by the phrase, it may go beyond the ? I ask the Commissioner to put some flesh on those two issues for us.  The final point  by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the Commission within the various organs of the Energy Community Treaty  has been answered in general terms in the Commissioners letter. However, I invite him to share any further thoughts he may have with Parliament on detailed implementation of these undertakings.  Finally, I come to the crux of the matter: whether Parliament should vote for the recommendation. Let me say that I recognise the good intention of the Commission in offering to brief my committee about the work undertaken in the preparation and negotiation of this Treaty, although our reaction might have been more welcoming and less suspicious of what was being proposed had it not come out of the blue without any prior knowledge on our part.  I also recognise and appreciate the Commissions efforts to persuade the Council to take this Treaty down the assent procedure route instead of, as it were, slipping it through on the nod. However, I am bound to observe that this was after we began raising questions about possible empirebuilding by the Commission.  This Treaty could provide an important message to the countries of southeast Europe, and even beyond, that the EU is capable of being outwardlooking and wants to embrace them in the family of European nations. I am not entirely sure how much comfort Bulgaria will derive from this, given the earlier decision to force early closure of Kozloduy  a decision which no longer has any technical justification in my view, but maybe this Treaty could help offset that negative message.  I close by expressing the hope that the Council in particular will be able to give us sufficient comfort this evening so that we can proceed to a favourable vote tomorrow.
6859725 author: Alastair White:  . Mr President, before answering the questions put to me, I would like to start by explaining the global approach towards the Energy Community. We know, and there is some consensus, that the two main routes for enhancing energy security in the European Union are diversification and the strengthening of market forces. Extensions of the EUs own market to include our neighbours would gradually create around the EU a shared regulatory area with common trade, transit and environmental rules.  In this context, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to present a successful initiative in the region of southeast Europe. It is not only because of its needs that the European Union acted in this area. The disintegration of the former Yugoslav energy system has brought havoc to the regional market, by breaking electricity connections, disrupting trade routes and forcing the system to work  on a chronic basis  far beyond its capacity.  On the other hand, industrial decline and population shifts have made demand much more capricious and more varied, so the technical challenges of keeping the system alive were preventing development and a fresh start. Indeed, some European Union aid was being used to buy electricity and fuel oil for immediate consumption. Such a situation could not go on.  Apart from these immediate needs, the Commission made a strategic decision to look at the longterm needs, to gather international consensus for a way forward and create a real basis for postwar cooperation in the region.  Today, I can present to the European Parliament the results of our joint work. It is valuable to the stabilisation and economic development of these countries. Within ten years we have gone from war to cooperative management of the most essential sector of the economy: energy. Along the way we have faced difficulties and sometimes scepticism. And I have to thank Parliament for assisting us in overcoming these difficulties. I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, and the shadow rapporteurs.  The issues we have been discussing are not only related to investments. We have also addressed environmental and social issues in our debate. So the creation of the Energy Community for southeast Europe clearly responds to the needs of the region and of the whole EU.  Let me now turn to the question. Firstly, the Energy Community Treaty provides for a procedure ensuring cooperation and mutual assistance of the parties in the event of disruption of gas or electricity supply affecting a party. This is quite an important clause. One example is the recent gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine, but also, for instance, the blackout in Italy in  2003 , which demonstrated the need for solidarity among European countries, and the importance and the benefits that such a solidarity clause could have in the energy sector. I would also recall that this winter Serbias gas supplies were cut off for quite a considerable time.  Pursuant to the draft conclusion decision, the positions that can be taken by the European Community under Title IV of the Energy Community Treaty, providing for the creation of a single energy market between the European Community and the countries of southeast Europe and containing the mutual assistance clause, have to be inspired by the existing .  As mutual assistance may not be fully covered by the existing  and in some cases our is perhaps not ambitious enough  it was important to introduce some flexibility to this limitation as regards the mutual assistance clause. The reference to specific circumstances allows for this flexibility. It will, ultimately, be up to the Council to decide by qualified majority, whether or not the specific circumstances are met on a casebycase basis. In my view, this concerns situations of extreme gravity and extreme disruption.  Of course any measure concerning the mutual assistance clause will have to remain within the external competence of the European Community. Let me highlight, in that regard, that decisions of the Energy Community on mutual assistance have to be taken by unanimity so that the European Community will have a veto on all decisions to be adopted.  Secondly, let me stress that, through its proposal to the Council, the Commission has steadily acted in favour of an increased role of Parliament as regards the ratification of the Energy Community Treaty. In this regard, once the Treaty has entered into force, I consider it of utmost importance that Parliament be fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community.  To this effect, Parliament will be informed in advance of each semiannual Ministerial Council of the European Energy Community. I have also instructed my services to ensure that Parliament is informed in advance of the European Community position to be taken before the institutions of the Energy Community on important issues and that it has full access to the Energy Communitys documents. There are no restrictions on official documents of the Energy Community and all policy documents are placed on the Energy Community website. These documents are accessible to all those who have an interest in them.  In addition, as provided for in the Treaty, the Energy Communitys Ministerial Council will, on an annual basis, submit a report on the activities of the Energy Community to the European Parliament and all other national parliaments involved, as the PresidentinOffice mentioned. In line with the proposed Conclusion Decisions, the Commission will further submit to Parliament, every three years, a report on the Energy Community.  I hope that my answers to the questions are satisfactory. I would also like to mention the issues referred to by the honourable Member with regard to Kozloduy, because I would like to separate this issue from the Energy Community Treaty.  The energy chapter with Bulgaria was closed in  2002  and both sides have agreed to close that chapter on the basis that units  3  and  4  of Kozloduy will be closed on the grounds of safety requirements. That means we have provided aid for Bulgaria to deal with this situation. So I would not make a connection between these two issues, because the decisions have been taken by mutual understanding and we have done quite substantial work to help Bulgaria deal with the consequences of the closure of units  3  and  4  of the Kozloduy power station.
8782152 author: James Bush:  . Mr President, normally it is ladies first, but I am delighted to start the process, otherwise we are going to go round in circles.  With todays decision on the shape of the new financial perspective now behind us, we must now look ahead and formulate the broad strategy for implementation in the coming years, whatever its imperfections in terms of balance or level of expenditure allocated. From the outset it is noticeable that the annual policy strategy treats the budget year of  2007  as one of a continuing series in the life of the Commission to implement the wellestablished priorities of prosperity, solidarity, security and Europe as a global partner. We take a different view. We do not believe that it is business as usual. On the contrary, we see the  2007  budget as being a real opportunity to set a new strategic tone to the way in which the European Union delivers its policy agenda.  When reading the document, there is a strong sense of complacency, Madam Commissioner, a real lack of urgency about how to tackle the global economic political challenges facing the European Union. Not least, there is no specific mention of the rapid rise of China and India in the global economy. This will undoubtedly affect substantially both internal as well as external policies in the year ahead. If, after all, strategies formulated at regional and local level, such as in the Thames Valley, include this factor as an urgent priority, why does the Commission choose to leave it out?  In sum, it reads rather like a routine bureaucratic document without serious political leadership or guidance. Running through the report are three interlinked strands.  The first is the combined impact of reduced resources under the new financial perspective, and the emergence of new challenges leaves us no option but to set clear priorities in the next budget. These priorities must be focused to reflect the new challenges lying ahead. This is more a process during the life of the financial perspectives than simply in the  2007  budget. In setting policy priorities for external relations, the  2007  budget must lay the groundwork for an increasingly outwardlooking European Union. Our citizens security and prosperity will depend on how effectively the Union can respond to global challenges in a world very different from that only a decade ago. We should aim in fact to lead, rather than harness, the globalisation process. In these circumstances it is essential for the Union to develop a coherent, overarching strategy which will better define its strategic priorities in the  21 st century for the world outside, and that must begin with this budget.  Secondly, interlinked with the first priority, is that of ensuring security for European citizens in areas such as freedom and security and justice, as well as the specific sector of energy supply that we have just been discussing.  No less important for us is the third priority, dealing with internal policies. Here we must focus on those areas that are key to Europes competitiveness and our future prosperity. These include research and innovation, innovative measures for SMEs, support for lifelong learning for renewing skills and key infrastructure projects.  In the light of limitations on the Unions financial resources, we must examine more closely the quality of European Union expenditure. The beginning of a new financial perspective offers a significant opportunity for starting a rolling programme for assessing the performance of EU activities. Through costbenefit analyses we will take steps to assess whether specific actions achieve their objectives, what their impact was compared to the quantity of expenditure allocated, and what European added value they contributed.  We are convinced that such a focus on quality is essential in order to compensate for a lack of quantity in budgetary means. This would mean deleting programmes if they no longer produce value for money and creating programmes that are more relevant to a changing global environment. It should also mean avoiding the use of public funds, for example in information policy, where EUfinanced actions could replace viable, ongoing private initiatives.  We believe that Parliament must take the initiative to begin preparations for the midterm review of the next multiannual financial framework planned for  2008 . This will allow us to drive forward the comprehensive reassessment of the EUs revenue and expenditure and shake up the system in order to create momentum for adapting our political priorities.  In conclusion, the  2007  budget procedure, as the first budget of the new financial perspective, represents a real opportunity for a broad mobilisation to adjust to the new policy challenges of a fastchanging world. This fits in, Madam Commissioner, with the Commissions focus on policy by results, but a broader global vision is needed. Let us be open to new ideas and provide a strong focus on policy priorities, while improving the EUs accountability.  Finally, I will warmly welcome contributions from the outset from all parliamentary committees to establish the sectoral priorities for this budget. I believe we have a great opportunity to shape our future policies together and respond effectively to the demands of European citizens.
4972518 author: Christoph Corless:  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Committees on Regional Development, the Environment and Agriculture and the respective rapporteurs, Mr Galeote Quecedo, MrBerend, Mr Capoualas Santos and MrsEstrela, for their hard and constructive work.  Recent trends seem to indicate a growing vulnerability of the European Union to disasters, and natural disasters in particular. The incidence of extreme weather events and related natural disasters is increasing, perhaps fuelled by the effects of climate changes. This year again, floods have raged in central and eastern Europe with four countries  Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria  requesting assistance through the Community mechanism for civil protection. I am proud to say that European solidarity and generosity has once again mitigated the affliction those countries had to suffer.  The four reports rightly point out the human, environmental and financial costs of such disasters. The Commission therefore very much welcomes the European Parliaments initiative to examine the various aspects involved, with a joint effort by no less than three parliamentary committees. The jointly organised hearing earlier this spring has certainly made a valuable contribution to this process.  The reports rightly consider a whole range of measures aimed at improving risk prevention and the response to crises. The Commission agrees with the recommendations regarding the need to adjust action in the area of prevention and management of natural disasters, as well as the need to coordinate Community instruments.  In fact, the reports reinforce the Commissions integrated approach to its policy on disasters, which includes instruments regarding prevention, immediate response and more longerterm, solidaritybased action. This approach is intended to strengthen the EUs capacity and effectiveness in preparing for and responding to major disasters, while avoiding duplication of effort.  Some of the proposals contained in the reports have already been endorsed through the Commissions action. We are now proposing even more concrete ways to act. Our recast of the Council Decision establishing the Community mechanism for civil protection is the legal embodiment of a number of proposals put forward in these reports. These proposals are consistent with the Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument. The recent Barnier report also explores certain forwardlooking suggestions for our response to disasters.  The Commission also welcomes the progress on the negotiations for the proposed floods directive on the assessment and management of floods and the positive vote in the recent ENVI Committee meeting. The Commission would equally welcome strong support from this House for a directive that gives all citizens a right to the same approach and level of ambition for flood risk protection, prevention and preparedness, regardless of where they live in the Community: in transboundary or national river basins, or in the coastal areas of the Community.  Not only are floods on the increase with changes to our climate, but droughts have become more prevalent in Europe. At the request of a number of Member States, the Commission is analysing the issues of water scarcity and droughts. Options are under consideration and we expect that a Commission staff paper will be available shortly.  Another relevant instrument for the future could be Life, the new financial instrument for the environment. It aims, , to support the efforts of Member States in the field of forest fire prevention, mainly through the implementation of knowledgerelated measures such as training and awarenessraising campaigns.  Equally, the Commission is prepared to cofinance prevention measures under the cohesion and rural development policies. Member States are invited to include appropriate actions in their programmes for the forthcoming period, where prevention will be one of the priorities.  Under the rural development pillar, Member States can also implement specific measures to restore the potential of forestry or agricultural production. Under the rural development programmes, they can also request that a severe natural disaster be recognised as , in order to derogate from certain conditions under the agrienvironment measures. Those possibilities continue in the new programming period from  2007  to  2013 .  We must not forget, though, that natural disasters are not the only threat the Union is faced with. It must be prepared for and able to respond effectively to challenges. Major manmade disasters, major threats to public health and acts of terrorism might require just as much of a common European response. For the Commission, it is sometimes difficult to explain why the Union should be absent in some circumstances. The lack of a concrete expression of Union solidarity has already been a source of embarrassment to the Union during some of the traumatic events of recent years. The Commission is therefore particularly grateful for the widespread support expressed in Mr Berends report for extending the EU Solidarity Fund to nonnatural disasters and for enlarging the scope of eligible operations accordingly.  The Solidarity Fund created in  2002  has generally worked quite successfully, if judged against the objectives and conditions set out in its legal basis. Aid has been granted in  21  cases, concerning  15  Member States and candidate countries. Those who criticise the Solidarity Fund as being ineffective or too slow have a point. However, experience since  2002  has also led the Commission to the view that the existing fund has a number of shortcomings and that modifications to the current regulation are necessary. That is why we have proposed a new Solidarity Fund Regulation. The new proposal is based on the current Solidarity Fund, while introducing a number of modifications aimed at widening its scope, making the fund more transparent, and introducing a number of operational improvements, in particular the possibility of making advance payments so that the fund reacts more quickly and effectively.  The Commission nevertheless considers that the fund must remain limited to public emergency intervention. Insured or private damage, including agricultural damage, should not be compensated. The polluter pays principle and third party liability must continue to apply.  As with the current fund, the new proposal is based on the subsidiarity principle. The EU should intervene only when a state is considered to be no longer in a position to tackle a disaster alone. Consequently, there should be a relatively high threshold for European intervention. Today this threshold is defined in terms of direct damage, which must exceed EUR 3 billion, or  0 . 6  of GNI.  With the new proposal, the Commission has therefore sought to improve the transparency and simplicity of the criteria governing the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund. That would help the national authorities to have a clearer idea of when the fund is likely to be able to support them in recovering from a disaster.  Alongside the enlarged scope, a major element of the proposal is therefore a new definition of the criteria for triggering the fund. The operationally complicated regional criteria would be abolished in favour of only quantitative criteria. In compensation for the loss of the regional criteria, the quantitative threshold would be reset at EUR 1  billion, or  0 . 5  of GNI, whichever is the lower. This would increase the predictability of the European Unions Solidarity Fund decisions, thus reducing the workload in the Member States in preparing applications for support that have little or no chance of success.  Solely in the case of truly unexpected and exceptional situations, such as those where physical damage is limited, for instance terrorist attacks or major public health crises, the new fund could be mobilised by a political decision of the Commission, to be confirmed by the European Parliament and the Council.
7247096 author: Alastair Brown:  . Mr President, we all recognise the importance of being prepared for disasters. We all wish for a better response to emergency situations. Significantly, we all recognise the need to work together. The resolutions passed by Parliament last year, these commendable reports and the Commissions proposals all aim to achieve the same purpose.  The call for increased cooperation in civil protection clearly reflects the Commissions line of thought. To react effectively to a disaster, we need to have all our available resources in a state of ready deployment. When these do not suffice or are unavailable, the Commission needs to be empowered to find alternative means.  As regards the agricultural aspects, I should like to emphasise that the Commission will do its utmost to optimise the use of existing instruments. It is clear that, at this stage, solutions or assistance for the agricultural or forestry sector in the event of natural disasters will have to come via existing instruments under the rural development and forest policies, state aid and the possibilities that exist under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy.  I would be more cautious as regards greater budgetary flexibility to ease the problems for the agricultural sector. We are tied to the funds available. I see major difficulties in using underspent budget lines for disaster relief purposes, but the Commission is prepared to analyse the feasibility of any suggestions. One difficulty, for example, is that we will only know with any certainty late in the budget year whether there is any margin left in the budget. Finally, it should be remembered that in the future we will be more likely to have to apply financial discipline, which will reduce the likelihood of underspent amounts.  The Commission is also examining whether risk and crisis management instruments to support the agricultural sector could be a way forward.  I am particularly grateful for the great expression of support the Commissions proposal to adjust and improve the EU Solidarity Fund has received today. With the new fund, the EU will have an instrument at its disposal that allows it effectively to assist Member States and candidate countries whenever a crisis situation arises. An act of European solidarity can be counted on, no matter whether in response to a natural or another kind of serious disaster. This will be good not only for the European Unions image but also, more importantly, for the Union, the Member States and acceding countries and their regions and, in particular, for the people affected by such disastrous events.  The rapporteur and other honourable Members have spoken in favour of all major elements of the Commission proposal. This represents invaluable support in steering the proposal through the remaining steps of the legislative procedure. In the light of this farreaching agreement between our two institutions, the Commission appeals to the Member States and the Council to rethink their position which, up to now, has certainly been much less favourable than that of this House.  I note that you have proposed to grant Solidarity Fund assistance to candidate countries only if the same disaster also affects a Member State, even if this issue has not been discussed today. While I understand the underlying reason  i.e. not to financially overburden the fund  this proposal puts candidate countries in a worse position than they are currently in. At present, they are on an equal footing with Member States as regards eligibility for the fund. I would ask honourable Members to reflect again on whether politically this is what they really want.  I also note that the use of the Solidarity Fund for preventative measures has been proposed. There can be no doubt that prevention is an extremely important part of a comprehensive policy in relation to disasters, a view the Commission fully supports. But it cannot be the role of the Solidarity Fund, which has been designed to bear some of the emergency costs incurred by Member States in dealing with disasters. At EU level, prevention and reconstruction measures can be supported by the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, or by agricultural funds. In fact, risk prevention is one of the European Rural Development Funds priorities for the period  20072013 . In addition, rural development measures under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund can finance the restoration of agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and the introduction of appropriate prevention instruments, including risk prevention for forest fires.  We need to strengthen all of the European Unions existing instruments for the benefit of our environment and, more importantly, for the safety and wellbeing of our citizens.  I agree with those Members who said that actions of solidarity and actions taken to prevent disasters and deal with their consequences will bring Europe closer to its citizens. These issues are extremely important in order to get the European citizens full support for our work. That is why I should like to thank again all the rapporteurs, Mr Capoulas Santos, Mr Galeote Quecedo, Mrs Estrela and Mr Berend, for their excellent reports that will strengthen European identity.
10296505 author: Philip MacLeod:  . Madam President, let me start with my perception of EUUS relations from the external relations perspective. Commissioner Mandelson will then complete the picture on the economic and trade relations. I shall focus, therefore, more on Mr Broks report.  As this excellent report makes clear, the context of EUUS relations has changed enormously over the course of the last year. Following President Bushs visit to Brussels and the  2005  summit, the tensions we experienced in  2003  and  2004  have been replaced by a new spirit of constructive engagement.  We came out of the  2005  summit with eight declarations on a wide range of issues which guided our collaboration. The declaration on democracy promotion shows how far our cooperation on foreign policy has come. Even if there are differences from time to time  as we have just seen and the PresidentinOffice of the Council has just mentioned  we are now taking the initiative and being more proactive in our approach, rather than firefighting.  Our activity to spread democratic principles, respect for human rights and the rule of law  which Mr Brok highlights in his motion for a resolution  can only go so far. Without the full commitment of the country concerned, democracy cannot be sustained. Nevertheless, when that commitment is there, our coordinated action makes a difference, for instance  as has already been mentioned  in Ukraine, where we supported the reform process; in Belarus, where our common stance against the lack of reform sent a clear message to the regime; and in the Middle East peace process, where coordination is essential and where it works quite well.  I personally have been very closely involved in coordinating our position with the United States. The motion for a resolution mentions the need to better coordinate assistance. I am particularly pleased that the Quartet took up the EUs proposal for a temporary international mechanism to channel contributions to the basic health and social needs of the Palestinian people. We are working on that basis and I hope that we will be ready by the end of the month.  Before handing over to Mr Mandelson, let me mention four issues which are highlighted in the resolution.  The first is energy. Both the EU and the US are faced with record high oil prices and increased dependence on foreign supplies of fossil fuels. According to current trends, the European Union will have to import  70  of its energy in  2030  compared to  50  today. The US is facing a similar problem. We therefore need to take a holistic approach in tackling this problem, including involving our major partners. At next months EUUS Summit, we intend to establish a strategic cooperation on energy, addressing the security of energy supply  including the diversification of supply routes, the enforcement of market rules, the protection of infrastructure, the promotion of alternative sources of energy, and, finally, energy sufficiency. The key is to increase predictability by creating the right market conditions and legal frameworks in both the producer and transit countries. This is the message we will bring to the EUUS Summit, but also to the G 8  Summit and to other international partners.  The second issue is visas. One of the Commissions top priorities is to resolve the issue of the USs nonreciprocal application of visa requirements. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we will reach a solution soon, but we will continue to press for progress and will raise it again with President Bush at the summit. Last time, the issue was highlighted and we hoped that things would progress more quickly. In July  2006 , we will issue a second report on visa reciprocity, which may examine the possibility of taking specific measures in response to any lack of progress.  The third issue I wanted to tackle is China. As Mr Brok rightly points out in his resolution, we need to coordinate our approach to third countries, particularly China, effectively. We share the same approach: to help China move towards democracy and integrate fully into the world economy and the world market. Two years ago, we took steps to coordinate ourselves better by establishing the EUUS dialogue on East Asia. This has proved a very useful forum for discussing relations with China.  Let me address the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement. I know that MrBroks committee feels very strongly about this, and I fully support the desire to see transatlantic relations go from strength to strength. As you know, I have always been open to exploring the pros and cons of a contractual relationship with the United States. It is indeed strange that we do not have more formal relations with our most important partner. As the PresidentinOffice of the Council has already said, the question is whether a formal agreement would really bring much added value today to our relations. The most important thing is that the EU and the US work together for our common strategic cause. For this, we need political will, in particular, but also understanding towards each other. I feel that a treaty, for instance, would not have enabled us to bridge the differences which dogged our relations in  2003  and  2004 , which were political in nature. At this moment there is no political appetite for such an agreement either in the US Administration or among Member States. However, this might change in the future. Should attitudes change or should it become clear that there is, after all, an institutional obstacle to closer cooperation, then the time might be right to go further.  Let me end with a remark about the important role Parliament plays in transatlantic relations. As you know, I have always been an enthusiastic supporter of interparliamentary exchanges. I am convinced that these relations benefit greatly from the links between the European Parliament and the US Congress. I very much encourage you to continue to build these ties. I thank you for what has already been done in the legislators dialogue and what might be done before the summit.
8862999 author: Sarah Bush:  . Mr President, I want to thank Erika Mann for having shepherded this very impressive report through Parliament with her characteristic effectiveness, dedication and attention to detail; it is very timely.  The fact that the very comprehensive report on transatlantic economic relations has the input of half a dozen committees of this Parliament, and that it would need at least the same number of Commissioners present to discuss all the issues that are covered in it, shows how deep and intricate the EUUS economic relationship is.  That relationship effectively operates at two levels. On one level, steady leadership is required to promote a further convergence of our shared economic rules and regulatory frameworks  our companies, our jobs and our competitiveness demand this. At the other level, what happens in the rest of the world also depends on whether and how the EU and the US are able to react to events together.  No political relationship in our time is of greater importance to the global economy than the Transatlantic Partnership. The response to the rise of China and India, the pressures of globalisation, the current challenges in the energy field, the way multilateral institutions function, climate change: all these depend on the ability of Europe and the United States to cooperate effectively together.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the continuing WTO negotiations. I am fortunate to have had a shared sense of purpose with my counterpart Rob Portman, and I look forward to continuing this with Susan Schwab, the new US Trade Representative  I hope she will be confirmed shortly by the Senate.  It is no secret that I think the European Union and the United States need to bring our positions in the Doha round closer together. The warning bell is ringing on the DDA. The danger lights are flashing, because if the gaps are not closed in the coming weeks, we will face serious institutional, legislative and political obstacles to ending this round.  The United States will shortly swing into election mode, trade authority is set to lapse, there are electoral constraints in other parts of the world too  a coming election in Brazil, for example. The window on the Doha round is closing rapidly. Europe is ready to negotiate further; we have indicated our flexibility, and no sector is out of bounds to us. We look to our partners to express the same sense of purpose and openness.  Let me say a few words now on Erika Manns report itself. I am glad that it shows strong support for the work programmes adopted last November to implement the EUUS economic initiative. In the progress report which we will present to the next summit on  21 June, we will be able to list some good achievements. The EUUS action strategy for intellectual property rights enforcement in third countries will be endorsed. It will contain a number of concrete cooperation measures, especially between our customs services and embassies in selected third countries.  On the highlevel regulatory cooperation forum, too, I am satisfied that after two meetings in Brussels and Washington within a very short timeframe, we have now clearly established the forum as the place for EU and US regulators to exchange best practice. We hope very much that the benefits of increased cooperation will soon be felt by companies on both sides of the Atlantic.  The signature of the longawaited air services agreement, as well as the agreement on civil aviation safety, is now expected during the second half of the year. On the air services agreement, we will have to keep pushing the US Government to go ahead with the rulemaking changes and resist protectionist pressure from Congress. Your help in this House will be most valuable to us in pursuing this goal.  I welcome your continued interest in a more visionary and strategic approach  I happen to think that there is a place for vision in politics. I note your call for the  2006  EUUS Summit to design a new transatlantic partnership agreement that leads to the achievement of a barrierfree transatlantic market by  2015 . In my view, the EUUS economic initiative has shown that we are getting there, we are moving in that direction step by step.  Probably the right approach is to advance steadily on issues of mutual interest and to show  for example in the areas of intellectual property rights and regulatory cooperation  concrete successes to our citizens. We have to earn our way in our acceptance of the approach that I know is supported in the report. I think this pragmatic approach will be assured of support because in reality there is no US enthusiasm  either in the Administration or in Congress  for any bigger bang EUUS scheme. On issues like investment and public procurement, which you rightly identify as areas of enormous potential  and they do have very great potential indeed  the US has not so far shown any interest in tackling bilateral barriers.  On the investment side, the Dubai Ports fallout requires careful handling. We have now at least established a contact group to address both old and new problems, and have proposed to the US government to include an investment paragraph in the summit declaration regarding the importance of an open transatlantic investment climate. This should send a strong message to the US Congress, which is currently debating the Shelby bill on the tightening of the ExonFlorio Statute. Again, your continued help on this, along with that of the US Congress, would be much appreciated.  Finally I would like to point out that we have had a very good first half of the year clearing out some important EUUS trade disputes on Foreign Sales Corporations, on Byrd, on the telecoms sanctions  I hope we can keep up the momentum in other areas. I am looking at two other disputes particularly at the moment to see whether they are susceptible to early resolution. FSC and Byrd prove that the WTO dispute settlement system works and that the availability of WTOcompatible sanctions can be an efficient way of obtaining US implementation of WTO judgments. Given the good results of the WTO system, I do not see at this stage the need for the kind of formal bilateral trade dispute settlement mechanism which you propose in your report, but I do not want to reject the idea completely. Be assured that we will exhaust all our informal channels with the United States and try everything possible to avoid going down the expensive and timeconsuming route to Geneva, whenever this is avoidable.  In conclusion, let me say that the transatlantic relationship is one which is too often simply taken for granted. Especially at this time, what we need is renewed commitment in order to make it work better. I am grateful for your report, which has highlighted this need once again in a very timely way.
5813912 author: Victor Corless:  . Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to continue the dialogue on trade issues with the European Parliament. Mr Markovs contribution provides a wealth of information and policy prescriptions on how to tackle the crucial relationship between trade and poverty, both in our bilateral agreements and in multilateral negotiations.  I share to a large extent the overall thrust of the report. As I have said on several occasions, I want to put trade at the service of development. Trade is the driver of economic growth and, in the right circumstances, it spreads prosperity, but it is not a panacea and does not automatically lead to poverty reduction. Trade liberalisation needs to be implemented gradually. It should take place within a stable and supportive domestic policy framework and, in some cases, will require flanking measures to help bring about the process of adjustment.  We are already doing a lot of what the report recommends we should do. I shall give a number of concrete examples. Firstly, in trade negotiations, including in the DDA and EPAs, and as recommended by the report, the EU respects the right of developing countries to liberalise progressively and to maintain flexibilities for their sensitive sectors. Within the DDA, the EU is keen to see countries contributing according to their capacities and levels of development. This lies behind the idea of special and differentiated treatment. We are responding favourably to LDCs and developing countries interests in services, including as regards Mode  4  and in the sectors they have requested. Also, under GATT, we respect the freedom of countries to decide whether, and to what extent, they open up their service sector. We have not made any service requests to LDCs. We have set up a scheme to support ACP sugar producers in adjusting to changes following our sugar reform, and we are conscious of the need to address preference erosion. We actively promote regional integration and SouthSouth trade, which the report rightly recognises as key to development, especially for marginalised countries.  Beyond trade negotiations, in the area of building capacity, the EU  which is to say the Commission and Member States combined  provides more than  50  of the overall traderelated assistance funded worldwide. Commissionmanaged, traderelated assistance was around EUR 850 million a year in the period  20012004  and, on the basis of the pledge that President Barroso made at the last G 8  Summit, this will rise to EUR 1 billion in  2007 . We are actively engaged in the aidfortrade debate taking place in the WTO.  The Commission is also a pioneer in carrying out trade sustainability impact assessments  SIAs  to assess the potential impact of trade liberalisation on all three pillars of sustainable development. Since  1999 , we have carried out these assessments on all the EUs major trade negotiations, identifying areas where flanking measures may be needed.  With respect to the recommendations of the report on labour standards and social rights, although labour is regrettably not part of the DDA, all our recent trade, bilateral and regional agreements recognise and promote social rights, including gender equality, child labour, forced labour and freedom of association. Moreover, through GSP, we provide special incentives for developing countries that respect core labour rights. DG Trade is also funding an ILO pilot project on decent work indicators to predict and monitor the impact of trade on decent work.  I was also pleased to see in the report a number of recommendations addressed to other players. The report calls on other developed countries and advanced developing countries to implement dutyfree, quotafree schemes for LDCs, matching our own Everything but Arms. After agreeing on  97  coverage in Hong Kong, I would suggest, nonetheless, that the United States needs to engage fully on the implementation of that commitment.  The report also calls on other WTO members to match the EUs move in Hong Kong on export subsidies and to eliminate all forms of export support, including export credits and food aid. The report recommends substantial reductions of domestic subsidies by developed countries and a solution for cotton  again, key areas where we expect the United States to deliver.  Since this is an open dialogue between us, I should like to raise a couple of points where the Commissions views differ from the report. Aid for trade is an essential complement, but in no way a substitute, for a developmentfriendly outcome in the main negotiating areas of the DDA. The biggest gains for developing countries lie in the market access component of the round and, in particular, in the SouthSouth dimension.  With reference to the risk of fraudulent distortion of Everything but Arms, we should, of course, remain vigilant on triangular trade but, to our knowledge, only one case of abuse has been reported.  As to the recommendation to exclude public services from negotiations, we do not consider it necessary to renegotiate the GATT to exclude public services. It is entirely up to WTO members to decide which sectors they wish to open. We have, for instance, made it clear that we do not wish to take additional commitments on health, education and audiovisual services.  Let me once again thank all those who have contributed to this report for their political support and guidance, and for the constructive criticism and concrete suggestions for action contained in it and others like it. I remain committed to informing Parliament regularly and to listening to your views on major trade and development matters, as I have done to date and will continue to do in the future.
6550019 author: James Brown:  . Mr President,  2007 , the first year of the new financial perspective, will be a year of spending consolidation in Parliaments budget estimates for the coming year. Through this stocktaking exercise and consolidation process, we must strengthen what is proving to be efficient, and shed, or at least reduce, activities which do not add value.  In this type of scenario, the implementation of activitybased budgeting commands greater importance. The report, moreover, stresses the fact that the budget should reflect actual budgetary needs. This explains why it is necessary for the retention or otherwise of the selfimposed ceiling of  20  to be evaluated thoroughly. We need to carry out a costbenefit analysis to examine what serves Parliaments best interests, including its financial independence now and in the future, when the Members Statute amounting to circa EUR 100  million per annum comes into force in  2009 .  This budgetary approach translates into more effective, transparent and analytical estimates, which leads me to another key issue in the report: the acquisition of parliamentary buildings. In this respect, and considering the recent events regarding the purchase of the WIC and SDM buildings in Strasbourg, we have no hesitation in putting into reserve the EUR 50  million intended for the purchase of those premises.  It would be inadvisable to release these funds until the outstanding and unclear issues surrounding those premises have been satisfactorily clarified. We do not wish to underestimate the positive financial impact of our acquisition policy. We have repeatedly commented on the substantial savings this policy has created over the years. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to consider reexamining the overall acquisition policy of Parliaments buildings, including the information offices in the various Member States.  The report also addresses the issues relating to the visitors programme and information policy. Regrettably, no decision has been taken on the EUR 5 million allocated to improving the visitors programme. This situation is untenable and Members expect the Bureau to take a decision prior to first reading.  In  2006  Parliament decided to invest in three major information projects, which included the building of a new visitors centre, audiovisual facilities and web television. In this respect, the administration has put forward for our consideration funds amounting to EUR 25  million to implement these projects in  2007 . In principle we agree that more needs to be done to improve connectivity between the citizens and the new institutions that represent them. However, more precise and detailed information regarding political oversight, organisation, cost structure and programme contents have to be submitted before releasing all, or some, of these funds from the reserve. Bearing in mind the existing budgetary constraints, we are not as yet convinced that the request for an additional  74 posts is justified, especially at a time when we are advocating spending consolidation. Under these circumstances, the respective appropriation has been put in reserve until detailed information justifying this request is available prior to first reading.  On another level, it is to be noted that EUR 48  million are being allocated for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. In the event of a postponement, the financial impact of circa  24 million should be deducted from the  2007  budget.  Another important area we have focused upon in our report is that of the assistance and facilities available to Members. In this regard, the administration will be conducting a quality survey on the service being given to Members. We feel confident that the stocktaking process on the raising the game exercise, together with the surveys conclusions, should go a long way towards improving this important aspect.  In our report we have also referred to a number of other priorities that we have to address, such as training, recruitment related to enlargement, the assistants statute, security and contracts relating to external supplies. Regrettably, I do not have the time to address all these points, but we certainly cannot ignore them.  In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues, shadow rapporteurs, coordinators and members of the Committee on Budgets for their cooperation and constructive participation in drawing up this report with the common goal of improving the performance, quality and accountability of Parliaments operation.
2608909 author: Amy White:  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr VidalQuadras on his excellent report. This report demonstrates why high energy efficiency needs to be on the agenda of the European Union.  Constantly increasing energy efficiency levels is the most important viable longterm policy in order to achieve a sustainable, competitive and secure energy policy for Europe.  I am pleased to say that the Commission is already in line with most of the calls from Parliament. Indeed, we will integrate your considerations into our forthcoming Action Plan on Energy Efficiency, together with the results of the public hearing. I expect the action plan to be adopted just after the summer break. In addition, these considerations will be part of the Commissions work in the broader context.  I note the call on the Commission to be consistent with existing legislation. I agree. The action plan will build on existing legislation, and will focus on practical measures. I also agree with your request for regular updates on the state of implementation of the directives dealing with energy efficiency. Proper implementation and enforcement will determine the success of any EU policy. This will, therefore, be the first priority in our action plan.  You rightly point out that in these times of high energy prices, the  9  consumption reduction target over nine years in the directive on enduse efficiency and energy services may well be on the low side. On this issue, I would like to mention the following: the Commission is launching a comprehensive study on the energy efficiency potential in the different Member States. This study will give a clear overview of national potentials and the Commission will compare this with the ambition levels in the Member States. In this way, we hope to increase the ambition levels of the Member States.  In relation to financial issues, we work with international financing institutions to integrate energy efficiency into their lending strategy. The refurbishment of existing buildings, with an emphasis on social housing, is already part of the European Regional Development Fund in the new programming period. However, it is up to the Member States to ensure that they use this possibility.  I agree that fiscal measures can be a very effective instrument to further energy efficiency. Regarding financial incentives to speed up market transformation, the Commission is considering a number of options in the impact assessment report on the action plan.  I agree that public authorities should lead by example, in particular through their public procurement policy. They can make a substantial difference towards market transformation. We will closely follow how Member States integrate energy efficiency requirements into public procurement guidelines, as they are required to do under the Energy Services Directives.  In this respect, I also agree with your call for more public information and education, and this will make up the third part of our action plan  behavioural changes.  I will comment briefly on minimum efficiency standards for energyusing products, as well as labelling. The dynamic setting of minimum efficiency standards is embedded in the Ecodesign Directive. At the same time, we need to ensure predictability for investment planning by the industry. As regards labelling, this will also be looked at in the action plan in connection with awarenessraising.  I am encouraged by your call on the Commission and the Member States to deploy more initiatives to increase energy efficiency in transport. All options should be seriously considered. The Commission will soon be coming forward with a midterm review of the transport policy, and transport will also be one of the areas for action in the Energy Efficiency Action Plan.  On external relations, I agree that energy efficiency should be  in fact, it already is  a part of our relations with both energy suppliers and with the consuming regions. Dialogues on this issue are being held with Russia, OPEC, the United States, China, Japan and India. However, there is room for more action, both to make full use of the competitive advantage that we already have through existing technologies, but also because it is important in fighting climate change and ensuring security of supply.  I think there is complete agreement between your report and our work, and I would ask you to continue your strong support for our work in the energy efficiency field.  I should like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs once again for this excellent report.
5416602 author: Sebastian Merx:  . Mr President, MrsNiebler, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be saying a couple of things in German, and from then on I shall be speaking from a English text, as I am standing in for my fellowCommissioner Mrpidla. Being, however, a woman who has been politically active for a long time and has always worked, I have to say that this issue of equality of opportunity is one of which I have, of course, always had personal experience, and real equality of opportunity is something I have always been committed to, so I can tell MrsNiebler that I am very glad to be doing this today.  I now propose to continue in English.  Mr President, the proposal for a revised directive indeed seeks to simplify, modernise and improve Community legislation on equal treatment of men and women at work. It incorporates within one document the relevant passages of the directives on this subject, so that the provisions are clearer and more practical for European citizens. It thus forms part of our efforts to have better lawmaking. The proposal is not simply an exercise in codification; it combines simplification with something I would call prudent modernisation.  In substantive terms, the most important aspects of the improvements are: the standardisation of terminology and, in particular, of definitions in order to ensure that the legislation is really consistent; the explicit application of a number of horizontal provisions to occupational and social security schemes, and the incorporation of the established case law of the Court of Justice in order to enhance legal certainty and clarity.  Modernising the directive in this way will help to bring about a considerable improvement in the legal framework of equal opportunities. Given the complexity of the current legal situation and the diffusion of legislation on equal treatment at work, the aim of this proposal  namely, to simplify Community law in order to make it more accessible to European citizens  is very important.  The text proposed today is the result of interinstitutional negotiations, through which a reasonable and very satisfactory compromise  which is acceptable to both colegislators  has been reached. The Commission also approves this text.  Parliament has played a very active and ambitious role in handling this matter. It has done much to improve and clarify the text of the directive. For example, a reference has been added to the importance of comparative statistics broken down by sex. Another provision requires organisations which promote equal treatment to exchange information with certain European bodies such as, for instance  as you mentioned Madam Rapporteur  the proposed European Institute for Gender Equality.  The overall compromise also includes two statements by the Commission and the Council which underline the great importance of reconciling work and private life as well as the importance of parental leave. Reconciling work and family life is a challenge for each and every woman in our society.  In its statement, the Commission said that it is committed to promoting parental leave as an instrument of paramount importance in order to achieve full equality between men and women in working life. We will make every effort to ensure that the conditions necessary to reconcile work and private life are improved by ensuring that this directive on parental leave is implemented appropriately, and particularly by monitoring its suitability and effectiveness.  In conclusion, the Commission therefore plans to make the reconciliation of work and private life one of its priority objectives and part of the roadmap on gender equality which was adopted very recently on  1 March  2006 .  In this context, there are plans to examine all the factors involved in reconciling work and private life, including parental leave, flexible working arrangements and support and care facilities with a view to finding solutions which are needed. This, we know, will involve launching a dialogue with the social partners. I am very pleased that the institutions have worked together so well on this matter, producing an acceptable and modern text, which will hopefully look to a better future for gender equality.
3109567 author: Mary Cameron:  . MrPresident, MrsDe Keyser, ladies and gentlemen,  first of all, I should like to thank the House very much for this important debate and the important report. The report mentions women as victims, women as instruments of war and women as instruments of peace. Indeed, we also see the three trends that are there, and I agree with you that all the legal instruments are already there, but very often what is necessary is much better implementation. We will all have to work towards that goal and I will promise to try to make a difference at least in the regions where I am responsible.  We are fully committed to implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1325  of October  2000 , on women, peace and security, where indeed all these issues mentioned. Your report also addresses the question of women in conflicts and as peacebuilders from many different angles. I very much support this approach because women cannot only be seen as victims. Very often they are key players in promoting peace.  For instance, in Palestine and Israel we see that women are coming together and they are those in the society that would like to go forward with peacemaking. The female suicide bomber is a striking example of the complexity of this issues, and a phenomenon that deserves further study. And as you said, very often it involves women who are somewhat isolated by their own societies and then, of course, who do not have any other chance, do not care for their lives anymore and then become suicide bombers.  The Commissions twopronged approach to promoting gender equality abroad is also well reflected in the report. First, we take on board gender concerns in all policies and programmes  so, there is a sort of mainstreaming. Secondly, we also fund specific projects to promote women. I am convinced this approach will remain valid in the future. Both mainstreaming and specific actions will continue to be necessary, but it is also about changing the societies there. It is about changing the mentality of the societies, as you very rightly said.  Mainstreaming is important because peacebuilding comprises this broad range of areas. These include peace negotiations, peacekeeping operations, demobilisation, disarmament, reintegration and rehabilitation. There, women always have their role  whether they are mothers, sisters, etc., women are there in the society and they see what is going on.  Also very important are election observation missions, security sector reform, institutionbuilding and, particularly, strengthening of civil society. We have also training programmes that can perhaps be enhanced in the future, where more than  800  Commission officials and other staff are involved in channelling the implementation of those programmes.  Another example related to capacitybuilding, which is highly important here, is that we are supporting training in the area of crisis management, intended for Member State experts deployed in that field. Promoting gender equality in crisis management and conflict resolution is an integral part of this whole training. Gender aspects are there.  When I say that supporting civil society organisations plays a key role, I think this is very true for instance for women in Bosnia and Kosovo, but also for training women in conflict resolution in Rwanda or Burundi and strengthening womens active participation in peace processes around the world, such as for instance in Georgia and Colombia. Through ECHO, our humanitarian programme, we are also supporting several projects focusing on women in affected areas like Afghanistan, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  This year, within our European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights, we are also focusing on issues such as equal treatment, women who are victims of genderbased violence in conflict zones, and the trafficking of women and children. So, there is quite an impressive amount of project proposals that are there. In total EUR 9 . 7  million are available for this campaign from the  2005  budget and this years budget.  In addition, this year we will also be putting increased emphasis on gender in conflict prevention network funding. Here we have to encourage civil society, thinkthanks and academia to provide external analytical experience. Then we have to see how we can implement that.
7592244 author: Sebastian Whittacker:  . Mr President, when I was made first vicechairman of the Petitions Committee, colleagues said to me that it would be rather like being the gatekeeper of a cemetery: I would see a lot going in, but not much coming out.  I am pleased to report, especially during last years activities, that we have seen a lot going in and a great deal more coming out. A cemetery it certainly is not; it is alive and kicking and due to get livelier. It is probably one of the most important committees in the House. Some would say that, as first vicechairman, I say that; but I honestly believe it to be true. It is the direct interface between the institution and the citizens  citizens often seeking redress for problems that arise at Member State level. I am also pleased to say that we work in close conjunction with the Commission. We are a solutionbased committee. People bring us problems and we try to work quickly and effectively.  At Member State level, the importance of the committee representing Parliament is not always recognised. One of my recommendations would certainly be for greater attendance by Member State representatives when we are dealing with issues that are germane to them.  The report is a lengthy one and that is primarily due to the fact that we have enlargement; there has been greater engagement with this committee. The petitions process and the work of the committee have played an influential role in bringing pressure to bear on Member States to ensure that EU laws are satisfactorily transposed and implemented. Importantly, it also highlights the plight of EU citizens whose rights are diminished. The introduction of the epetitions system has proved a useful tool for Members, assistants and group staff and allows us all to keep an eye on developments on ongoing petitions.  I mention some key points in my report. Without going into too much detail I should like to highlight just two areas where the committee has managed to be influential, although not totally so. The cases in point are the socalled Valencian Land Grab Law (LRAU), MsFourtous report, which we adopted in December  2005 ; and one of my reports on the confiscation of cars by the Greek authorities, which we adopted earlier this year. Those examples are good illustrations to show the best and the worst of the system. Yes, we have brought about resolution in some of the cases with the Greek confiscation of the cars, but I have to say that, sadly, the situation in Valencia is still grave, and requires further monitoring.  I make several recommendations in my report, including increasing the membership of the committee to approximately the same membership as other committees; and speeding up our processes in the way in which we work with the Commission to ensure close cooperation and effective working methods.  I want to pay particular tribute to the Commission staff, who often come to the committee, wait for a long time and then sincerely and effectively deal with the issues before them. We cannot thank them enough. The work of the Commission staff is not always fully recognised.  I feel it is important that we have clear rules, however, on the admissibility of petitions, especially for the future, in order to ensure that all citizens can have recourse to the petitions process but that the system is not abused. I have tabled only one plenary amendment to the report, on behalf of the Socialist Group, which underlines that in principle the petitions process is aimed at European citizens and reinforces the view that in principle the petitions process should be a service that is targeted at EU citizens who do not have other means of recourse to action by the European Parliament. MEPs, as citizens, can avail themselves of that right, but nonetheless they have other parliamentary processes at their disposal. I hope that other groups can support the aim of this amendment.  I should also like to pay tribute to the Petitions Committee secretariat and their tireless support for the Members work and our work. As with other committee secretariats which I have worked with, the Petitions Committee secretariat provides highquality assistance to us all. To put it simply, we would not be able to do the work without them. So I should like to finish by once again paying tribute to all members of the secretariat. I look forward to hearing the comments of the House. I should also like to thank the chairman of my committee, Mr Libicki, for all his work and the support that he gives me and others.
6785171 author: Sarah White:  Mr President, at this juncture I should like to express my special thanks to CommissionerDimas and in particular to his staff and to the shadow rapporteur for their excellent cooperation in the drafting of this report.  I believe that floods are truly a major environmental issue; we need only turn on our television sets to realise that they are happening more and more frequently. From  1998  to  2004  we had more than a hundred cases of serious flooding, especially on the banks of the Rivers Danube and Elbe in  2002 . These floods cost  700  lives, half a million people lost their homes, and the cost of the damage came to about  25 billion euros.  We had huge floods again last year, my home area being one of those directly affected, and so I believe that it makes good sense to consider at the European level what can be done to combat them. In particular, there is sound scientific evidence that the frequency and, more especially, the intensity of heavy rainfall have been increased by several factors connected with human activity.  I am thinking, for example, of headlong urbanisation, particularly in highrisk areas. There are urban developments in critical areas, we build streets there, we alter the course of rivers and, sad to say, we allow illconceived building projects in overflow areas on river banks. Then there is deforestation, which means among other things that forestry can no longer perform its protective function. Intensive agriculture, which can impair the porosity of upper soil layers, encroachment on riverside meadows and flood plains, building developments on pasture land, etc., all contribute to soil erosion and increase the risk of severe flooding. For these reasons I very much welcomed the Commissions proposal to present its flood action programme following the floods of  2000 .  Then came the Commissions communication on flood management, and after that the Environment Ministers invited the Commission to present this proposal for a directive. Reference has already been made to the Water Framework Directive. Let me remind you that Article 1  of the framework directive proclaims the purpose of not only safeguarding and improving the aquatic environment but also of mitigating the effects of floods. I therefore believe that this initiative from the Commission is taking us in the right direction.  The European regulatory framework is absolutely essential, especially in view of the fact that water bodies and watercourses do not respect national borders, and not even the best of national strategies can guarantee success. Thankfully we do have Member States, such as Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, and Austria too, that have undoubtedly made a good deal of progress already. But their efforts are thwarted by the fact that most strategies are purely national in character.  If we do create this European regulatory framework, however, we must still place special emphasis on the subsidiarity principle. This is why I took particular care to address this issue again in my report. I explicitly mentioned it in several places because I believe that the Member States themselves are essentially responsible for determining the level of protection they intend to afford their citizens and that they should act independently, especially with regard to their choice of safeguards.  In this respect, I feel it is especially important that the report takes the level of regulatory detail into account, that we do not go too far into detailed regulation at the European level and above all that we remain aware of another danger connected with the committee procedure, namely that of prescribing to the Member States rules formulated in a way which makes them politically undesirable.  We should also take care to ensure that the Member States can implement the directive with the least possible administrative and technical input. Previous work should be protected; in other words, full account will be taken of the efforts Member States have already made to combat flooding. There is therefore no way in which parallel European rules can be used to compel Member States whose work on flood defences is already far advanced to implement a different set of measures, even though their own existing system already works perfectly. Associated with this is the need for close synchronisation with the Water Framework Directive, so that everything in the daughter directive lies within the scope of its parent directive.  The principle of solidarity is also important. This means that no Member State should take any action that harms any other Member State. The principle that the premierleague nations should always consult those in the lower division is extremely important, in my view.
3096528 author: Jennifer Merx:  . Mr President, today is an important day for science. With your support, we can look ahead to a EUR 54 . 5  billion research programme to be launched by the end of this year. EUR 54 . 5  billion in current prices is less than we had proposed, but it is a substantial increase on the current programme and we also have to thank Parliament for that. Together, we are making the Seventh Framework Programme a programme for boosting growth and jobs, for promoting a sustainable and healthy Europe.  It is also a programme for a stronger Europe: research unites in diversity. For that to happen, we need cooperation, ideas, people and capacities and those are the titles of the four main axes in the Framework Programme.  The cooperation programme will bring together our best talents from across Europe to research and develop and find answers on economic opportunities and societal challenges, for example in the areas of health and energy. The ideas programme will introduce a new mindset in supporting and conducting research in Europe. The people programme will attract and motivate the best scientists to work across Europe or beyond, for the benefit of European research. The capacities programme will ensure that Europe can rely on excellent capacities for conducting research in all parts of Europe.  Our continuous efforts towards simplification will ensure that we attract the best participants, irrespective of size or origin, and that we get the best value for our investment.  I am impressed by the consensus that has emerged in Parliament on Framework Programme that delivers on the ambition. I wholeheartedly thank Mr Chichester, chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the rapporteur, Mr Buzek, the shadow rapporteurs and all other Members of Parliament who made this possible.  Your objective is to further improve the Seventh Framework Programme. I am pleased to say that the Commission will be able to accept no less than two thirds of your amendments, either as a whole or in principle. Some other amendments are, in our assessment, too detailed for the Framework Programme, or they go beyond the remit of research and development. We will quickly come to an agreement on those. Some amendments create difficulties for the Commission. They concern topics for which we have a shared understanding of their importance and priority, but not yet on how to realise them. I do not think that they should become stumbling blocks. They relate, for example, to keeping space and security together as one priority, avoiding the definition of a quantitative target for SME participation, preventing the introduction of support in the people programme for interregional mobility within the same country and ensuring that technology platforms remain flexible, bottomup and industrydriven in defining strategic research agendas and guiding their implementation.  Let me spend a little time on two issues which have been the subject of your intense debate.  I should like to start with the European Research Council. This is probably the most exciting new development in the European research landscape. Parliaments strong support will help to make it a reality. We have to get the structure right, so that independence is guaranteed in support of scientific excellence and administrative capacity is available in support of efficiency. The Community method can guarantee this and it is for this reason that we have proposed to set up the ERC within the remit of the Community institutions. I am sure that we will be able to accommodate much of the substance of Parliaments amendments in a way that will also help to create common ground with the Council. However, I am afraid that a review in  2008 , after only one year of operation, will not be very meaningful. Much as I understand Parliaments wish to be associated with the European Research Councils success, I do not think we have the appropriate legal basis to decide on the followup to the review in codecision.  I am most concerned, however, about proposals to predetermine the future structure of the European Research Council even at this stage. What message would we give out with such an automatic change of structure? That we got it wrong in the first place? That the ERC we set up will not be independent? I simply cannot accept that logic. It would not help us in our joint aim to create a European Research Council of which we can all be proud. I believe that we are enabling the ERC to be independent and efficient. I have heard Professor Kafatos, chairman of the ERC Scientific Council, say on several occasions that the structure proposed by the Commission, as well as the stance taken by the Commission, ensures precisely that.  We propose that an independent review should be carried out, with the full involvement of various parties, not least the Scientific Council, in time for the future structure of the ERC to be considered not later than  2010 . The review should look explicitly at the advantages and the disadvantages of a structure based on an executive agency and a structure based on Article 171  of the Treaty. The ERCs structures and mechanisms should be modified in accordance with its findings. This should be done in consultation with Parliament, but always with a view to maintaining the total independence of the ERC from any political influence.  As regards the administrative and staffing costs of the ERC: yes, we want a lean and costeffective implementation structure, but, no, at this stage we do not know enough to impose strict and specific limits for administrative costs that might risk undermining the functioning of the ERC at its outset.  Let me turn to the issue of stem cell research. I know that this has been a matter of intense discussion amongst many of you and I should like to say at the outset that I have profound respect for each personal opinion. The Commission learned from the intense debate on this issue during the negotiations on the Sixth Framework Programme. We are convinced that, in view of the diversity of approaches existing in Europe, we can only propose a responsible, cautious and practical approach, evaluating and selecting this type of research on a casebycase basis and excluding certain specific research areas.  The procedure established for the Sixth Framework Programme ensures that some major health challenges and the hopes of the patients concerned are addressed through this research. At the same time, it guarantees respect for fundamental ethical principles in a way that it is unique for a research programme covering  25  countries or more. This procedure has proved to work and to be acceptable to Member States and to the scientists. What we propose is nothing less and nothing more than that the procedure be continued for the Seventh Framework Programme.  The Commission acknowledges very positively the outcome of the vote on this issue by the ITRE Committee, which is entirely in line with the Commissions proposal and provides even more useful clarification. It would be misleading to present a deviation from this approach as a true compromise between proponents and opponents of embryonic stem cell research. For example, introducing a socalled cutoff date that would make human embryonic stem cell lines eligible or not eligible for Community funds would have farreaching consequences. Such a cutoff date has no scientific or objective basis. It might prevent the European researchers from using the lines they have created and force them to work with lines produced outside Europe. In addition, it might severely compromise access to the best quality lines which, in this very new field of research, are generally considered to be those most recently produced. It might unduly limit access to the specific stem cell lines which are indispensable for patients.  In other words, it has to be clear that any date will compromise the label of scientific excellence in this sector which I am personally eager to attach to this Seventh Framework Programme, as long as ethical concerns are taken fully into consideration, which I believe is entirely the case with our proposal.  One last word on subsidiarity: the current strict procedures and limitations on embryonic stem cell research entirely respect the subsidiarity principle. Relying on the ethical standards of either the most restrictive or the most liberal countries would simply be against the basic principles of the European Union.  I cannot end this introduction without mentioning the very broad agreement on the Euratom programme, which includes the important international scientific project on ITER, and the Joint Research Centre, whose mission you considered very important.  I am very curious to listen to the debate now and hope that it will be possible to add some short concluding remarks afterwards. This Parliament has truly made excellent progress. I hope we can maintain this momentum. Getting FP 7  started in time will require an increased effort from all of us. Time matters! FP 7  is a central part of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs. It is on that count that Europe can and should deliver on time. This will be an important signal to our partners in the world, to the whole of Europe and to our scientific community.  I think that our three institutions have never been so close to each other in deciding a Framework Programme. With your support, we will be able to reach our current goals on time and mobilise our researchers to start participating, as from the end of this year, in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the realisation of the European research area that turns knowledge into true growth and true jobs. Together we can prove that Lisbon is back again.
8445055 author: Lynne Bush:  Mr President, I should like to answer succinctly as many as possible of the concerns and issues raised. Firstly, on behalf of the Commission and personally, I should like to thank all the Members for their cooperation and support, for which I am very grateful. The number of speeches made this morning clearly proves that much attention has been devoted to the issues concerned and sends a clear signal as to the importance of European research to the future of Europe and to our lives and economies.  I shall start with the budget and budgetary structure. The difference between the budgets that Parliament and the Council are proposing is now  2 , which is a very minor difference. I believe that we have a common understanding and that agreement on this point should be relatively easy.  I would like to point out that one must be careful when comparing the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes, as these are structured differently and are sometimes difficult to compare. For example, in current prices, there is a  60  increase for actions under FP 7 , against one of  30  for the old continuity actions. Therefore, an increase of over  30  for certain continuity actions means that we are actually making these clear priorities.  Twentyfive per cent of the actions are new, and approximately  75  of the actions are continuity actions. As regards thematic priorities, we must understand that these will also be addressed by the European Research Council, either now or in the future, but of course we do not know in advance what the structure of those thematic areas will be.  Turning to small and mediumsized enterprises, I honestly have nothing against  15 , but believe that this must come about through political change. That is why I advocate simplification and why I believe that the  15  or  25  additional funding we are offering to small and mediumsized enterprises should result in changes. That is why we must pay attention to their needs, particularly in the work programmes.  Concerning energy, it is clear  as a number of you quite rightly pointed out  that this is one of the major challenges we must address in the future. We all agree on this. However, the Commissions opinion is that the challenge is simply too serious for us to leave any potential area out of the research  from renewables to hydrogen fuel cells, clean coal, nuclear energy, smart networks and more efficient use of energy, etc.  This a truly important issue, and on the subject of environmental challenges such as climate change, I would say that these are more serious than we are sometimes ready to admit. Practically all our efforts in the field of research should move in a direction that makes our lives easier in the future. If we continue in the current direction we will be faced with some very serious challenges.  I would like to make a few remarks regarding embryonic stem cell research and the European Research Council, which I talked about in my introduction. As regards embryonic stem cell research, if you ask any top scientist about this  as I have done recently  they will tell you that the right approach to addressing major health issues is through a combination of efforts from different sources and origins. That is their clear answer.  I was asked a question on the Eurobarometer on biotechnology. As you know, the Commission regularly conducts Eurobarometer public opinion surveys on issues relating to biotechnology. The  2006  version is currently being finalised and should be available in the next ten days. However, since the question put was a clear one, I can tell you that, as regards the views on embryonic stem cell research across Europe,  55  of the population surveyed approved of this provided there was the usual government regulation or tighter regulation. Seventeen percent did not approve, except under very special circumstances. Only  9  did not approve under any circumstances, and  15  did not know. So, if one were to draw a line,  50  would approve this with tighter regulation,  25  would oppose it, some would allow it under very special circumstances, and  15  do not know. By the way, this is in line with the study published last year on social values as regards science and technology. This study found that over  90  of European citizens believe that medicines and new medical technologies will have a positive effect on our way of life over the next  20  years.  I should say that we are aware of the differences that exist between different countries as regards what we are discussing today. This is not really a discussion about moral issues, but on whether we can establish a system at European level that strikes a balance between the very different national practices, bearing in mind ethical considerations. I truly believe that the Commissions proposal is going in the right direction.  The European Research Council represents a major change of mindset in Europe. That is why we should all be proud of what we are delivering. I want to try to convey to you how seriously I am taking this. Last weekend Professor Kafatos and I were in the United States and met the presidents of the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health. I wanted him to be clearly visible on stage and for him to be seen as someone with whom they should correspond and cooperate in the future.  I fully agree that the Cohesion Fund and the Framework Programme on Competitiveness and Innovation should be used hand in hand. Therefore, I fully agree with the inclusion of the concerns of the lessdeveloped regions. We have to improve capacities there. We have to do everything in terms of infrastructure so that they can compete as regards excellence, and we need this excellence because we are in a global race. It is crucial that we understand that.  Fisheries will be a crosscutting issue on which special attention should be focused, and the Commission has clearly underlined that.  Women are genuinely underrepresented and we are trying to do our best to change that.  Technology platforms have vast potential. They have developed from research actions but have already outgrown that purpose and have a role to play as regards lead markets and the European Institute of Technology, etc. They will be a crucial factor.  As regards simplification, this was one of the most difficult tasks I have ever undertaken, but we are pushing ahead as hard as possible on this.  In reply to the question from Mr van Nistelrooij about the midterm review of the structural funds, I cannot commit myself because this is not in my area. However, it is a proposal in which I have an interest and I see it as a logical proposal which is going in the right direction.  As regards the point on education, we are trying to pay special attention to universities because we believe that they could do more than they are doing now and that sometimes we are not too benevolent towards them.  In conclusion, time truly matters, as some of you have underlined. It is crucial that we deliver the programme on time, so that the implementation rates in  2007  are as high as in the past. That is very important because it is a political affirmation of research and development that would strengthen our hand in future debates, which also link into budgetary issues. We want to go beyond the framework programme and into the European research area. There has been a switch of direction in Europe since the Second World War to a knowledgebased economy. Also, the rules for participation should be addressed very carefully because they are part of this timing issue and we should consider them carefully.  The Commission is willing to be flexible and constructive in this trialogue, and wants to make a success of our common endeavours.  Finally, I agree with those of you who feel that the budget should be higher, but at this moment the best thing is to focus on the delivery. If we focus on delivery we can prove that we need more financing in the future and that we can change European reality.
5294458 author: Christoph Finlayson:  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate. Once again it has been confirmed that we have the same approach and that we see eye to eye on this issue.  Almost all aspects of the preparedness plans are generic in nature. That means that, when we prepare for a possible flu pandemic, we are preparing not just for the possibility of avian flu, but for any flu pandemic and, when it comes to it, for any health threat. Since they are mostly generic in nature, they can be used in any kind of health threat and they are therefore a good investment on the part of the Member States and the Community that will not go to waste. We should all pray that they do go to waste, that we do not have a health crisis and will never actually need to use them, but nevertheless it is a good investment in preparedness, both for natural pandemics and for bioterrorism.  We are much better prepared than we were last year or the year before. We have not yet reached the target and we can never actually say that we have. It is a continuous effort and there is always room for improvement, always a need to do more. Nevertheless, we have really come a long way, but we still have much to do. We still do not know a great deal about the specific virus. That is why we have invested so much in research into the specific avian flu virus and how it behaves. We have certain statistics, but given the areas where the virus usually occurs and is endemic, the reporting and monitoring is not as effective as in some other areas. We still lack data and will therefore be investing in this.  I will not go into the animal health side, since we had an opportunity to discuss that recently in this House. However, the basic policy of the European Union, as well as the world community, is to make sure that avian flu remains an animal disease. In order to do that, we have to eradicate and deal with it effectively at the animal level.  Cooperation is very important. We had the postBeijing Conference in Vienna last week, where practical steps were discussed for implementing and fulfilling the pledges already made in Beijing. It is true that progress was slow. I am optimistic that things will speed up now. All the European Commission decisions required for the EUR 100 million pledged are in place now and it will start being spent on the various initiatives. The next meeting will be in Africa and will cover the problems of the region. I must remind you that the European Community has pledged money specifically for the African continent.  I agree that it is very important to have the involvement of all services. That is what we have done in our specific plan and that is what we encourage Member States to do in their own national plans. There should be a lead preparedness and response authority, but all services in each Member State and at Community level as well should be involved.  The interoperability of national plans is also very important and we have been working on that. I totally agree with those of you who raised the issue, for example, of borders closing. In the reality of the European Union, one Member State cannot close its borders or cancel flights from a specific place when we have the internal market and freedom of movement. We need cooperation and coordination. We have already set up the structures and mechanisms to achieve that at Community level. We have raised this issue at G 8  level  international level  as well, proposing the no first use principle, so that no G 8  partner would close its borders and cancel flights without at least consulting the others in the group.  I take your point on the issue of the institutions. As you know, we have been working on continuity of Commission services. We have also asked Parliament to look into this matter, and will be working closely with Parliaments services to ensure continuity within Parliament and its meetings and services.  Antivirals are certainly a debated issue. Antivirals are not a panacea, they are not a cure, they are the first line of defence and we have always said that. But as long as we do not have the pandemic virus, we will not have the pandemic vaccine which would be the basic defence. We are trying to shorten the period required to develop an approved licence and produce the vaccine, but we will need something in the meantime and antivirals are one solution.  As regards the issue of stockpiles, it is not just that some Member States object to the principle, but there is also reluctance by many Member States on the funding of the stockpile. We explained that it will not be a substitute for national stockpiles. On the contrary, in our options paper we have introduced a condition that, in order to be able to benefit, a Member State will have to prove that it has actually begun creating its own national stockpile. That would be a great relief, not only for the Member States that are still in the process of developing stockpiles, but for the neighbouring countries as well, and for the WHO. The WHO would not then have to worry about the European region, because we would take care of ourselves and our neighbours and the WHO could concentrate on other regions in greater need than us.  I totally agree with Mrs Grossette, but I am afraid that was not the response we received. I was disappointed, but at the same time we have to be realistic. I do not want this debate to continue and then be used as an excuse for some Member States not to develop national stockpiles. Unless the Council changes the position, the Austrian Presidency, challenges  if I can use the expression  the Member States to say they will be willing to review the position. It is important to emphasise that Member States will have to create their own national stockpiles.  I totally agree that this is a question of solidarity. To be realistic, if we cannot agree on the solidarity principle now, what is going to happen if there is a crisis and one Member State has to share its medicine with other Member States, with all the citizens feeling threatened? One of the weaknesses detected at the exercise last November was the unwillingness on the part of Member States to share medicine. We therefore need to establish solidarity now, when we can be more realistic in our approach than in a time of crisis. Then it can work in the way we would all wish. Nevertheless, we will try to coordinate the Member States and at least make sure that they take all the necessary steps for the sake of their individual citizens and European citizens in general. I will, as always, keep Parliament informed of every step we take.
2798182 author: Katarina McNabb:  . Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful for this opportunity to report, on behalf of the Commission, President Barroso and my colleague Ms FerreroWaldner, on the EURussia Summit which took place in Sochi on  25 May. The summit took place one year after the adoption of the four roadmaps for the Common Spaces and thus provided a good opportunity to review the progress made since then.  The summit was the occasion for the signature of the visa facilitation and readmission agreements. The visa facilitation agreement will help encourage contacts between the peoples of the EU and Russia. The readmission agreement will help tackle illegal immigration, an issue of growing concern to both the EU and Russia.  At the summit, there was a very open, frank and substantive discussion with President Putin on energy. It was never our expectation that we would find complete agreement in Sochi, but the Summit did clarify our respective positions. That was extremely helpful as we prepare for the European Council discussions on the external aspects of EU energy policy on the basis of the joint paper by the Commission and the High Representative. The EU and Russia are and certainly will remain interdependent in the energy sector and there is a genuine opportunity to integrate EU and Russian energy markets in a mutually beneficial, reciprocal, transparent and nondiscriminatory manner. In that regard, we look forward to continuing our dialogue with Russia both bilaterally and multilaterally at next months G 8  Summit.  As for the future framework for EURussia relations, the Summit agreed that our aim should be to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with a new, durable, comprehensive and legallybinding agreement which should be capable of promoting the further development of EURussia relations. The PCA would remain in place until a new agreement comes into force. The Commission is currently preparing draft negotiating directives to that effect. If the Council is in a position to adopt them by the next EURussia Summit, negotiations could begin by the end of this year. For both the EU and Russia, Russias WTO accession remains a key priority. This will lay the foundations for bringing EURussia trade and economic relations to a qualitatively new level in the context of the PCA successor agreement, taking into account the existing PCA objective of a free trade area.  In that context, let me report to Parliament that we are making good progress on agreeing a new framework document for the renovated Northern Dimension policy. The Commission is negotiating the text with Russia, Norway and Iceland. I am pleased to say that Russia shows every interest in confirming its joint ownership of the Northern Dimension policy. We hope to have an agreement in time for the senior officials meeting in Finland in September. We will keep Parliament informed and seek to ensure that the parliamentary dimension is included in the new policy.  International issues were discussed in depth at the summit. The dialogue which has developed with Russia over recent months, in particular on Iran and the Middle East, is a sound example of the EU and Russia working to put the concept of effective multilateralism into practice.  The EU also emphasised the need to work together with Russia on issues in our common neighbourhood. We remain firmly of the view that the resolution of the frozen conflicts and the development of democracy and market economy in the countries of the region represent the best route to ensuring a stable, peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood for both the EU and Russia.  A number of other sensitive issues were discussed in a constructive spirit at the summit. The EU stressed the importance of Russia ratifying the border agreement with Estonia and signing and ratifying the border agreement with Latvia. In that context, let me welcome the recent meeting between Prime Ministers Kalvitis and Fradkov and hope that this represents the start of an intensified bilateral dialogue.  The EU also raised its continuing concerns with regard to the situation in Chechnya, notably in the light of the most recent visit by the UN High Representative for Human Rights, Louise Arbour. The regular EURussia human rights consultations continue to provide a useful forum for addressing these issues.  In conclusion, the summit demonstrated the breadth and depth of our common policy agenda with Russia. As the EURussia strategic partnership develops, the need for EU coherence becomes all the more essential. The dialogue the Commission has with the European Parliament on Russia is therefore a very important element in this regard in enhancing coherence, coexistence and the effectiveness of EU policy visvis the Russian Federation.
3088501 author: Sebastian McNabb:  . Madam President, thank you for a very serious and substantive debate. I fully agree with Mr Winkler in that regard. MrEurlings and various Members pointed out that we must not trade human rights for energy; I fully agree. We want both human rights and energy. How can we do that? We need principles, pragmatism and partnership.  Let me point out that in the field of human rights we have established a set of formal consultations and we have had three meetings since the launch of these consultations in  2005 . By way of example, the latest meeting focused on four issues: firstly, on the Russian law on nongovernmental organizations; secondly, human rights in the military; thirdly, issues relating to the north Caucasus; and fourthly, racism and xenophobia. We also held a preparatory meeting with human rights nongovernmental organisations, which we deemed particularly useful.  I want to inform you that we will be holding the next meeting of these consultations in November in Moscow and will be pursuing the idea of closer involvement of NGOs. We want to make these consultations more resultsoriented in the future.  I can assure you that the Commission will keep human rights at centrestage in our relations with Russia, not least as we are talking about the country which currently holds the Presidency of the Council of Europe.  On energy, Mr Kelam referred to the interdependence between the EU and Russia. We can also say that we not only have interdependence but also import dependence, since by  2020  the EU will have to import around  70  of the gas it consumes. According to current forecasts, Russian production and export capacity will fall short of EU needs unless massive investment takes place in Russia.  We are therefore working to ensure that sufficient additional quantities of gas can come into the EU and we will have to look at all possible sources and routes, including Turkey, incidentally. This requires strengthened cooperation and increased imports from Russia, as well as from other countries.  At the same time, let us keep the big picture in mind. One of Europes greatest challenges will be to reduce dependence on energy imports and on fossil fuels. Therefore, it is very important that our energy policy and the external aspects of Europes common energy policy are very high on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency and, I trust, of all the future presidencies.  Reference was made to Gazprom and its ambitions to purchase EU assets. In this regard the main concern within the EU is the apparent lack of a level playing field. EU companies which may invest in upstream assets in Russia do not have the right to independently access the Russian gas transportation infrastructure. Within the EU, the right to access gas transportation infrastructure is enshrined in EU legislation.  In this context, the rules applicable to Gazprom, notably EU competition rules, would be no different to those applied to any other company. The fact that Gazprom is the exclusive supplier of gas from Russia to the EU would have to be taken into account in any objective analysis.  Reference was also made to free trade and the PCA. I want to finish with this, because this is a very important strategic issue in EURussia relations. The objective of a free trade agreement was already included in the PCA when it was concluded in  1994 .  For a free trade agreement, Russian accession to the WTO is a prerequisite. In this regard, it is important to note that the WTO accession process is now coming to its final phase and we expect that this condition will soon be met by Russia.  Reference to a free trade agreement was made at the Sochi Summit for further exploration. Our point of departure is that trade and economic integration will be core elements for the postPCA agreement and our intention is to set up a broader and deeper free trade agreement, some kind of FTAplus achieving deeper free trade than normal, simple free trade agreements.  Let me conclude now, because I know that many colleagues have more important things to do.
2475831 author: Michael Finlayson:  . The Commission attaches great importance to the rights of freedom of religion, belief and expression in its dialogues with third countries.  Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief is one of the fundamental human rights and, as such, is enshrined in a number of international instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights makes clear that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that cultural, religious and linguistic diversity should be respected.  Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law underpins the Cotonou Partnership signed by the ACP States and the Community and its Member States. Article  8  of the agreement indicates the topics on which regular political dialogues should focus, referring specifically to ethnic, religious and racial discrimination.  There is no state religion in Nigeria. In  1999 , the Constitution provided for freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the federal government generally respects those freedoms.  The Constitution also prohibits state and local government from adopting an official religion. However, state governors have great autonomy and it is alleged that Islam has been adopted de facto as a state religion in several northern states.  The return of Nigeria to democracy in  1999  has seen an improvement in the human rights situation, but it has also seen an increase in tensions and violent conflicts, which currently provide the most threatening challenges to the new democratic Nigeria.  In this complex and unstable situation, the Commission has been trying to identify the most common causes of conflicts with the objective of helping to address and prevent them. Conflicts and violence have historically marked relationships between Muslims and Christians, particularly in the central states, where communities of different religions are numerically equivalent. It is generally not possible to cast Muslims or Christians systematically in the role of aggressor or victim, as they have historically been both. It is apparent, however, that conflicts always involve extremely poor people and that conflicts presented as religiously motivated are often triggered by other causes, including conflicts between traditional rulers, land and resource struggles amongst communities, political infighting, and tensions between state and federal governments.  The significance of the tension between indigenes and nonindigenes is crucial to understanding the frequent cause of conflicts in Nigeria. A recent report by Human Rights Watch, They do not own this place, blames the federal government policies that discriminate amongst nonindigenes, defined as people who, no matter how long they have lived in an area, cannot trace their origins to the ethnic and genealogical roots of the original inhabitants of that area. In a country with more than  250  ethnic groups, these discriminatory practices spreading at state and local government level have relegated millions of Nigerians to the status of secondclass citizens, increased poverty and created the conditions for intercommunal violence.  According to Father George Ehusani, secretarygeneral of the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, interviewed by Human Rights Watch, poverty in Nigeria has assumed the moral character of war and that is what you see reflected in much of the ethnic violence in this country. The Commission and the EU Member States are engaged in regular dialogue in Nigeria to promote respect for human rights, basic freedoms and the rule of law among communities, religious and ethnic groups, state and federal authorities.  Since the first Niger Delta crisis in November  2004 , regular visits of the EU Heads of Mission have been organised to various areas: the Niger Delta, some northern states and some middlebelt states. While one of the focal sectors of EU development cooperation with Nigeria is supporting and promoting good governance at federal and state level, the Commission is also engaged in financing Community projects in the Niger Delta and is about to approve a project to support nonstate actors. Moreover, the EC budget lines have for years been financing projects to promote democracy and human rights.
9004854 author: Claire McNabb:  Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity, one year after the French and Dutch No votes and only one day before the European Council, to answer Mr Leinens question. It also gives me the opportunity to outline the Commissions position on the period of reflection and on the constitutional process. I partly replied to that question last month, when I presented this Chamber with the Commissions two communications to the European Council  the assessment of the reflection period and PlanD  and the Citizens Agenda, to deliver results for Europe. As President Barroso has already outlined, we have set a Citizens Agenda with these concrete projects and the things we want to achieve.  Before I come to the next steps to be taken, let me say this about the first steps. The Commission, as you have already heard, remains wholly committed to the principles, the values and the efficiency gains that the Constitutional Treaty would bring. We also welcome further ratifications, as from the Estonian Parliament recently, and as we have heard being announced from the incoming Finnish Presidency.  I would also like to reply to Mr Leinens question and proposal to look at the effects of a No to the Constitution or no Constitutional Treaty, and we are fully willing to do so. I think we should look at what would be the consequences and the costs of no Constitution at all. We cannot ignore the fact that right now we have no consensus, no common position among Member States on the fate of the Constitution and the institutional reform that we need so much. We cannot allow ourselves to be paralysed by this, and we are not doing so, as you have already heard.  To begin with, the Commission intends to implement the ambitious policydriven agenda to address citizens expectations and restore public confidence in the European project. After President Barrosos outline, there can be no doubt about our determination. We shall deliver, and we will have to do that on the basis of the current treaties. We cannot afford to wait for what will shortly be  27  Member States to reach a consensus on the constitutional issue.  At the same time, the Commission remains fully committed to debating and engaging in dialogue with citizens at European, national and regional levels. The methods we will use are set out in Plan D  as in Debate, Dialogue and Democracy. We should use that to explain the added value of the European project. We should use that to argue why we need a new Constitutional Treaty. We should use it to discuss the political priorities with citizens.  Our two institutions may not always agree on every detail, but there is one fundamental belief that we share: our commitment to becoming a more democratic, transparent and effective Union. And that goes beyond any period of reflection.  I also believe that European affairs suffer from a participatory deficit. Still, citizens have high expectations on delivery and policy content, and this places important demands on the Member States and on our institutions. We must involve citizens more in the policy process at all levels, particularly young people and women. Such initiatives should be concrete and seen as a permanent function of developing European affairs, and they should ensure that the feedback process is taken seriously  what do we do with what we hear in dialogue and engagement with citizens?  and that listening is followed up by concrete actions.  I have said it before and I will say it again: Plan D is not a rescue operation for the Constitution. It is not limited to the reflection period  be it one year, two years or even more. It is a starting point for a longterm democratic reform process. We want to create a citizens ownership of EU policies to make them understandable and relevant, and to make EU institutions accountable to and reliable for those they serve.  I see and hear of lot of nostalgic harking back to the good old days of the European Union, but nowadays it is no good having a few men shut themselves away in a castle somewhere trying to solve the problems of the European Union. Today we need to engage citizens; we need the support and trust of citizens and the confidence of citizens to be able to build a future for the European Union. We need to engage and create the participatory functioning of the EU institutions.  As you pointed out in your motion for a resolution, we need a special focus in PlanD for the coming year, until the June  2007  Summit. I have already promised the Commission to come back after this Summit with a kind of midterm review. I will pay close attention to the Summits conclusions in that review, and also to the resolution of this House.  Delivering concrete results and reconnecting with European citizens will create the favourable climate that is necessary for successful institutional reforms; that is the way we motivate it. So far, Plan D has been a successful exercise in terms of setting off a wide range of activities, and I believe we have started to think and reason somewhat differently. We focus on what is our reality of today and for the future, how we need to interact with todays and tomorrows citizens. Over  660  activities have been taking place in Member States; hundreds of thousands of citizens have visited the Europe debate website.  For the future, I also think, as Mr Leinen does, that we need more of a citizentocitizen approach to allow citizens to meet across borders to discuss the European agenda. We should focus particularly on young people, the Europeans of tomorrow, and mobilise more women in the decisionmaking process. We need the whole of the European project to be more participatory, more transparent and more effective, and this ambition goes beyond any period of reflection. That is the only way we will be able to take the European Union into the future.
6561030 author: James Cameron:  Mr President, the success of this weeks Summit rests, first and foremost, on delivering on one concept: democratisation.  Democracy, transparency and accountability must be the building blocks that shape the future of our Union. Without a clear commitment to all three, we will be left with the piecemeal solutions that have stalled reform efforts hitherto and reinforced public distrust in the Union.  Europe will be built with the support of the citizens or not at all. Addressing the democratic deficit means an end to the rubberstamping of regulations behind closed doors. That is why my group congratulates the Austrian Presidency on building on commitments to make transparency the rule rather than the exception in EU policymaking and welcomes the willingness shown by the President of the Commission to publish the names of those who sit on thousands of European Union advisory committees. We still look forward to receiving them, MrBarroso.  We call on the Council to announce that all discussions on lawmaking by codecision will be open to public view. We know  as the journalist Meg Greenfield wrote  that everybody is for democracy in principle, but it is only in practice that it gives rise to stiff objections. We note that, whatever they say in public, those two old secret plotters, Britain and France  the two countries that nurtured democracy at national level and yet with her offspring now suffer amnesia  are still resisting openness in the Council. It is up to the other countries to pull them kicking and screaming into the  21 st century.  In the short term, the Council must put its faith in Parliament and allow us greater legislative scrutiny. Key initiatives, particularly in justice and home affairs, are often hampered by the absence of qualified majority voting and they end in stalemate.  The time has come to apply the clause of Article 42  and shift policies from the third to the first pillar, as proposed by the Commission in its Communication of  10 May, for our reputation  indeed our influence  rests on upholding values like democracy, liberty and respect for human rights.  Data protection in the third pillar is necessary to ensure protection of personal data. Likewise, minimum procedural guarantees for the European Arrest Warrant  which I had the honour to pilot through this House  have been held up in the Council since  2001 .  We want to see progress on all of those issues in order to make the European Union more democratic and more effective. Europe demands no less than an unequivocal drive to democratise decisionmaking.  In the long term, only a constitutional treaty  as practical as it is ideological  can provide the institutional framework to democratise Europe. But it is also time to recognise that the sixteenth and final Member State likely to ratify the Constitution in its current form is Finland. We must recognise that France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will never ratify the  2004  text. Denmark, Ireland and Sweden cannot ratify in current circumstances. The Czech Republic and Poland choose not to ratify, and Portugal will find it almost impossible, while committed to a referendum.  So there are two options: renegotiation or oblivion. The sooner we take steps to make structural and substantive improvements to that text and address public concern, the better.  President Barroso, I welcome the vision and determination you are showing today. But I want to hear you say that louder and more often to the Member States. You are right  they are all shareholders in the enterprise, but they have been gripped by a fad for shorttermism, and anyway the markets are falling. We need to hammer home to the Member States just how much they need the European Union.  My group thanks the Austrian Presidency for its good work thus far. We wish you success with other important items on your agenda: migration and other aspects of the Hague Programme; social and economic policy; the fundamental rights agency that we so badly need. Make sure too that our Foreign Ministers have aid to Palestine and CIA renditions on their agenda. The fine wines that you served them at Klosterneuburg were a good aperitif. They now need to sit down to the meat.
5007713 author: Christoph LaCourt:  Mr President, the Sustainable Development and Lisbon strategies together address issues that really concern people. European value and quality of life surveys tell us that citizens want prosperity, but they also want a clean environment, good health, social protection and equality.  The Commission put forward its proposal for the review of the European Unions Sustainable Development Strategy in December. This has been the subject of indepth debate in the Council, culminating in the adoption of a review of the Strategy at the European Council scheduled for tomorrow. I welcome Parliaments input from January on the stocktaking and orientations for the review, and I appreciate the involvement of many of you in the stakeholder debate on this subject. I look forward to working with you further on this, on the issues raised in the motion for a resolution amongst others.  Sustainable development is an overarching objective of the Union. The European Union Sustainable Development Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy work hand in hand towards this objective, although they should be kept separate. Together the strategies are an agenda for change, for Europe to adapt to a changing global context: new competitors, an aging population, and the impacts of demographic change, increased resource scarcities, climate change, biodiversity, and ecosystem loss, for example. They aim to stimulate innovation, including behavioural change, create level playing fields and engage all.  The Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy are complementary. The muchneeded economic growth must be decoupled from environmental degradation and must better safeguard social cohesion to ensure it can be sustained. At the same time, though, the worldwide drive towards more ecoefficient products and services creates opportunities for growth and jobs that we must seize.  For both we need to act. By achieving results on sustainable development, we improve our chances of regaining citizens confidence in the European Union. To achieve results, we need to focus and be clear about who does what. This implies a certain practical distribution of work between the two strategies.  The Lisbon Strategy addresses concerns about mediumterm economic performance, looking to stimulate growth and jobs and helping the European Union to adapt to global competition and increased pressures on resources. To achieve this aim, the Lisbon Strategy comprises actions in a wide range of policy areas, many of which are central to sustainable development strategy, such as energy efficiency, environmental technologies resource use, and others.  The SDS addresses concerns about our prosperity, both in economic and quality of life terms, including issues that are more slowburning, where timelags mean that actions now have impacts into the long term. A good example is climate change, but also unsustainable modes of transport, social exclusion, health and how we use our natural resources.  It also looks at broader global challenges and impacts beyond the European Unions borders. But let us be clear: Lisbon and the SDS are mutually reinforcing. The success of one depends on the success of the other. The priority now is to achieve results. There have been more than  20  years of debate on sustainable development, but progress in addressing unsustainable trends is too slow. We must move from words to action.  Some say that we are not ambitious enough. I disagree. The Commissions revised SDS provides a new political drive for sustainable policies that apply to all policy areas.  We also welcome the priority given by the Austrian Presidency to the revisions of SDS and the draft conclusions that will be discussed at this weeks European Council. We are talking about a new drive aimed at making the difficult changes across society that are necessary for sustainable development. The review of the European Unions Sustainable Development Strategy is about how we can do things better to get results: first, about how we design policy, including policies within the Lisbon Agenda; second, about implementing what has been agreed; third, about making sure that we involve all those who need to act. The European Union institutions cannot achieve sustainable development alone.  The new strategy addresses some of the weaknesses of the previous strategy: unclear priorities, little ownership and absence of a clear monitoring mechanism. It confirms the main challenges, but clarifies the objectives and sets out a new and more rigorous monitoring mechanism. It includes regular reports from the Commission, which are to be submitted every two years, drawing on the latest Eurostat indicators. It includes national strategies, to be updated to bring them more into line with the European Union Strategy, and it includes peer review of national strategies to allow mutual learning.  We need to learn from best practice and use every opportunity to multiply successful initiatives. By clarifying priorities, we will also facilitate the coordination of the Lisbon and Sustainable Development strategies.  The renewed Sustainable Development Strategy reemphasises the importance of an integrated approach. The problems are interlinked and so are the solutions. Good use of impact assessments that address the economic, social and environmental impacts of proposals is key. Horizontal measures, such as getting prices right, investment and research and innovation, education and skills are also important. The new strategy is about all of us assuming our responsibilities. Involving stakeholders, businesses and citizens in delivering results is a priority. It is also about all European Union institutions and Member States working for the implementation of the Strategy.  We believe that the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should play a more active role in helping to implement and monitor the strategy.
3825159 author: Mary Corless:  . Mr President, I wish to thank everyone for this very interesting debate. The debate shows that this subject is a central issue for Europe and that it is a priority which the Commission believes can contribute towards improving the quality of life and preserving resources, especially for the benefit of future generations. It goes towards improving the economic, social and environmental dimensions of our way of life.  The Commissions proposal has emphasised and given added relevance to the underpinning principles of our sustainable development policy. Moreover, we have given ourselves clear objectives with correlative actions to reach these targets. Concerning the need to be more ambitious, and the call for new targets, I need to underline that the essential thing is to produce results. Investing in new targets may not be too difficult. However, it is much harder to get people to make and accept the changes needed to achieve those targets.  We are meeting our existing targets, but the real challenge is to ensure that we do so. We are therefore proposing a new approach aimed at making the difficult changes across society that are needed for sustainable development. Having said that, I agree that setting new targets is also important. However, any new targets need to be established through a proper process involving impact assessments and full stakeholder consultation, so that we have the acceptance and the commitment of those who need to work in order to achieve those targets.  I would also like to say something about the integrated approach frequently mentioned during the course of this debate. Sustainable development is about a coherent approach to policymaking. It requires an integrated approach, and in practice this 1 it states very clearly that the European Union will maintain its aid efforts at at least the same level as that of the ninth EDF. Therefore, in my view, PresidentinOffice, the ACP countries were misled into believing that they should feel secure about future funding under the tenth EDF. The Commissions assessment was that for the tenth EDF, EUR 24 . 948 billion was the appropriate sum. In December, however, the Council in Brussels agreed on EUR 22 . 682 billion on current prices for the 20082013 period. PresidentinOffice, I give this history because I think it is relevant to the position adopted by Parliaments Committee on Development, which is that the Development Committee requires reassurance and clarification before we agree to give our assent to the amended Cotonou agreement. Past agreements should dictate that both the Council and the Commission should understand that when the Development Committee takes a strong stance, as we have done on the DCCI, we in that committee will maintain a very strong position on our principles. Our principles centre around development, and if they are not addressed, then the Council should understand that we will not give our assent until that is clearly part of the way in which you are operating. One of our concerns relates to the fact that certain members of the Council say that we should accept that we deduct EUR 0 . 3 billion for the EUs 21 overseas countries and territories and that a further EUR 0 . 9 means the Lisbon Strategy working handinhand with the sustainable development strategy  two strategies working in parallel and in coordination towards the overarching objective of sustainable development.  The Commission disagrees with the idea of merging the two strategies, but agrees they should be used in parallel towards achieving the overall goal of sustainable development and that they should be complementary, both in scope and in terms of governance. The Commission agrees that they can go handinhand, though this does not mean that they have to be integrated. This can be achieved through sound and effective complementarity between the two, and that is what the Commissions communication seeks to achieve.  Concerning governance and monitoring, improving the governance of the European Unions sustainable development strategy is key to pushing forward progress. That is why the proposal for the review of the strategy proposes a new improved governance process. The Commission will report on progress every two years. Let me assure you that in doing so it will draw on the full range of sustainable development indicators.  Eurostat has made good progress in developing indicators and this work will continue. The aim is not to name and shame, but to assess where we are, how much more we need to do, and in which areas, in order to enable us to determine where we need to act and to allow clear communication to electors and stakeholders on where we need to change and on our approach to this.  Concerning the international dimension, sustainable development requires a global approach. The European Union should maintain its position as a world leader in sustainable development through its action at home and by addressing the effect of this. It must also engage with others to achieve the commitments made at Johannesburg and the Millennium Development Goals in order, as has been said, to allow developing economies to leapfrog, to avoid oldfashioned unsustainable patterns of development and to use clean and innovative technologies. This is essential, for example, in the drive to limit climate change. It is also why the global dimension is an integral part of the reviewed European Unions sustainable development strategy and why that strategy advocates an integrated approach to development and external policies.  In conclusion, the Commission hopes that the interaction between us in this area can continue and intensify in the months ahead.
3806547 author: Roger Whittacker:  . Mr President, let me begin with , as we say in the Irish language  meaning a few words  on the title of this report. Following the final vote in committee I was asked if I would be prepared to accept an amendment in plenary to modify the title of the report, which refers to fishermen, so as to implicitly recognise the important role played by women in that important sector. It will not come as any surprise to you that I fully support the Migulez RamosKindermann amendment, which is totally consistent with the contents of the report and simply introduces the notion of gender equality in the title.  Like you, I learned on Monday that this amendment was inadmissible. Like many of you I found that hard to believe. However, you will be pleased to know that this evening the Conference of Presidents has approved the change in the title of my report. From the outset, had I been allowed to draft this report in the Irish language, the problem would not have arisen because I would have used the word , which, unlike the English word fisherman, is genderneutral and embraces all those involved in the sector.  There is an urgent need to comprehensively address the multiple problems in the inshore fishing sector in the European Union. This aspect of the fisheries sector is the poor relation that has been ignored for far too long. The subject matter is vast and varied. It concerns every single coastal Member State, in most instances in totally different ways. That is one area of the fisheries sector where there is the odd reference, here and there, among the plethora of EU legislation, but no Community rules and regulations that specifically cater for the sector. I believe that anomaly has to be corrected.  Inshore fishing essentially takes place in waters that come under exclusive national jurisdiction, and yet inshore fishermen, in many instances, are subjected to common fisheries policy regulations while reaping few of the benefits. Inshore fishing is about the economic and social fabric of our small coastal communities. It makes a vital contribution to local economies where, in many instances, there is precious little else in the way of work. Inshore fishery activities essentially maintain the social fabric of those communities. They are also essential for the preservation of cultural traditions and practices, which must be preserved. And yet that sector has been ignored for far too long.  The future development of the inshore fisheries sector is dependent on social change. It is dependent on the existence of appropriate representative bodies. It is dependent on creating demand for improved added value produce through appropriate marketing structures. It is dependent on resolving the economic aspects that influence operating costs. Most importantly, it is dependent on the adoption of appropriate EU programmes specifically designed to help the sector. The inshore fisheries sector is badly in need of development and modernisation. That includes boat modernisation, notably where safety on board is concerned.  We must devise measures to minimise the effects of the increase of variable costs that results from high fuel prices. If that means adapting boat engines so that they can run on a high percentage of alternative fuels such as bioethenol then we must take the necessary measures to adapt boat engines accordingly.  We must do all we can to attract young men and women to the sector in order to ensure its continuity. I fear that will be impossible if we do not implement adequate vocational training systems geared towards concerned groups of the inshore fisheries population, not least the development of marketing skills. I believe that we must develop new ways of commercialisation and fully integrate coastal fishermen into the marketing process. We must also enhance cooperation and communication channels between organisation and stakeholders concerned.  My report is not  as some lobbyists would believe  an attack on recreational fishing in any one Member State. It is about the specific social, economic and environmental problems of the entire small inshore fishing sector in all Member States of the European Union. It is about promoting sustainable fishing.  This report is a contribution to resolving problems in the inshore fishing sector, not to creating new ones. My approach is to try to find the appropriate solutions so that different economic interests are catered for in a mutually 60000 tonnes of catches per year. The protocol sets the financial contribution at EUR 36 . 1 million per year. A substantial part of this amount EUR 13 . 5 million is earmarked for support measures in view of the implementation of a sustainable and reasonable fisheries policy. The agreement has been concluded for a period of four years and contains a number of elements on which the partnership approach is based. They include, amongst other things, an exclusivity clause which prohibits the existence of private licences or other private arrangements outside the scope of the agreement; scientific cooperation in order to promote responsible fishing in Moroccan fishing zones; the possibility of a review of the fishing opportunities on the basis of scientific evidence and within the limits required by the sustainable management of Moroccos resources; vessel monitoring system requirements to reinforce checks on vessels operating in Moroccan fishing zones; and the social clause applicable to local seamen signed on by Community vessels. I am confident that this agreement will be implemented in the best possible way and in the spirit of partnership, dialogue and remarkable mutual respect that has characterised our relations with the Kingdom of Morocco since the beginning of the negotiations. At this point allow me to turn briefly to the amendments. Although the Commission can agree with the spirit of certain amendments, such as Amendments 2 , 5 , 7 , 10 and 13 , it does not consider them necessary. Similarly it does not consider Amendment 4 necessary, and it cannot accept Amendments 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 11 or 12 . On Amendments 14 to 18 acceptable way. It would be incorrect for any interest group to read any other interpretation into the text.  Commissioner Borg, this report and this Parliament are calling on you to consider a new Community initiative for this important sector of activity. The men and women involved in the inshore fisheries sector are calling on you to consider a new Community approach. I believe that we have an obligation not to disappoint them. Knowing your personal commitment to fisheries, I know that you will not disappoint them.
2657343 author: Annette White:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my thanks and gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr  Neachtain, who has presented an excellent report. I should also like to extend my thanks to the whole Committee on Fisheries for having taken up this important subject in the form of an owninitiative report.  It is clear that smallscale coastal fisheries are in many ways different from fishing activities conducted by larger boats. Many of these differences are highlighted in the report, and I should like to mention just a few.  Small vessels stay close to the coast and mostly conduct fishing trips of a single day. The businesses are small and mainly familybased, and in most cases only one person operates the vessel, with the maximum being not more than three. The catches are landed and also often marketed locally, thus making this segment more dependent on the local economy. This part of the fishing industry is fragmented and not equally represented in shipowners organisations. These vessels operate in coastal areas, which are often biologically fragile, and where there is a lot of competition with other users, such as other fishing vessels or recreational fisheries and tourists.  However, I should like to stress that not all of these differences are disadvantages. In fact, some of them are distinct advantages, such as the freshness of the landed fish. However, it is also true that coastal fisheries have handicaps, and I agree with most of your conclusions in this respect.  I absolutely agree that it is not an easy task to define coastal fisheries, but this is exactly why I would strongly recommend basing ourselves on the definition which is used in Community legislation: vessels of up to  12 metres not using towed gear. This definition was agreed almost ten years ago and is a good basis for further action. However, it does not mean that at national or local level additional criteria could not be used when defining the role of the different players in coastal fishing areas. On the contrary, coastal management actions and plans should include further criteria depending on the specific settings of the area and the fleets involved.  Let me now turn to your specific suggestions. Here, again, I agree with most of your proposals, and in particular the establishment by local fishermen of coastal management plans, the harmonisation of data on coastal fisheries, the improvement of training for men and women involved in this type of fishing, better coordination of all aspects affecting coastal areas and fishermen, the improvement of vessel safety and of the safety culture for those involved, the need to recognise the role of women and improve their legal work status and, last but not least, the better involvement of coastal fisheries in decisionmaking and representatives bodies, such as the RACs.  But this leads me to the question: who does what? I am deeply convinced that it is first and foremost the local fishing communities themselves who have to come together, get organised and propose actions and initiatives. Secondly, many of the aspects that were mentioned are under the responsibility of the Member States, for example education and vocational training, jurisdiction over coastal areas up to  12  nautical miles, and the control and enforcement of safety standards, etc.  However, I also agree with you that we have a role to play at European Union level. You, the European Parliament, have started with a study, the hearing of last November and this owninitiative report we are discussing today.  The Commission has already started work too, and I have proposed specific treatment under the European Fisheries Fund, which will hopefully be adopted next week. Among other possibilities of particular interest to coastal fishers: the proposed European fisheries fund reduces to  20  the private contribution for the modernisation of vessels for owners of smaller ships. It gives them more favourable treatment in the conditions for engine replacement and urges Member States to give safety tonnage, preferably to smaller vessels. I think that this is a package of better treatment for this segment, which will contribute to bringing about some of the improvements mentioned in your report.  In addition, there are several areas of the common fisheries policy where coastal fisheries are treated differently or exempted from obligations, such as the requirement to use a logbook, remote sensing and VMS requirements.  In relation to conservation, however, smallscale fisheries have to take full responsibility in the management of fish stocks, because coastal waters are often the place where fish spawn and grow in the early stages.  Before concluding, let me just mention that my services have recently commissioned an important study, which is under way at this very moment, and which will give us a new and uptodate insight into several cases of smallscale fisheries located in different regions and seas of the Community.  The findings of this study are expected in the coming year and I am sure that they will help us to assess whether further action is needed and how to tailor it. I take up your suggestions and, building on your valuable work, will join forces with all the stakeholders, the Member States and, last but not least, all those who make a living from coastal fisheries in order to engage in concrete action to improve the situation and the conditions for this segment of the fishing fleet. Thank you for your attention.
6890398 author: James Brown:  . Mr President, on behalf of my colleague, Mr McCreevy, who could not be here tonight, I should like to thank Mrs Kauppi, who has been an outstanding rapporteur in terms of her mastery of this difficult and highly technical subject and her willingness to work constructively with the Commission and all parties. She has done a firstclass job, along with Mrs Bers, the chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Thanks also go to the Committee of European Securities Regulators for its excellent work.  Under the terms of the Prodi Declaration, the Commission is committed to taking the fullest possible account of Parliaments view. We have more than met that obligation. Indeed, we have incorporated around  90  of Parliaments amendments into the Commissions draft measures, which will be voted on by the European Securities Committee at the end of this month. On all the key points we agree.  The level of institutional cooperation on this file has been exemplary. It shows that Parliament, the Commission and Member States are able to work together in a sensible and pragmatic way in order to achieve the right result for Europes financial markets and Europes investors and consumers.  The Lamfalussy procedure, which we have all worked hard to develop over the past few years, works. Of course it is important to agree as soon as possible on the European Parliaments legitimate right of callback, which the Commission supports. We believe that Lamfalussy procedures will serve us well in the years ahead, allowing us to adapt our legislation rapidly to keep pace with market and technological developments, while maintaining essential democratic checks and balances.  The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive will intensify competition among investment firms, stock exchanges and other trading venues and improve standards of service to investors and benefit companies by lowering the cost of capital. It will update the single passport for investment firms, allowing them to operate across the European Union on the basis of an effective single authorisation and across a wide range of financial instruments. Aside from stimulating crossborder competition, it will diversify the range of products and services that investors can access and markets that firms can tap into. But crucially and essentially, investor protection rules will be harmonised at a high level so that investors can feel confident in using the services of investment firms wherever they are in Europe and wherever the investment firms originate from in Europe. Furthermore, these rules are principlesbased in that they put the onus on firms to behave and to always act in the best interests of their clients.  The rapid globalisation of financial markets is an opportunity for Europe. These implementing measures for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive mean that we are well placed to stay ahead. Our financial markets are in good shape. They are growing strongly and are set to grow even faster in future as the Union enlarges further, as our middle class expands and as people increasingly take responsibility for their own pension provisions.  Our common regulatory framework is more or less in place. MIFID is the last piece of the jigsaw where markets are integrating fast. The European financial landscape is becoming commercially more attractive. Leaving politics aside, the potential stock exchange measures represent a vote of confidence in Europe, in our stock exchanges, our technological prowess and our regulatory system. In the end what matters is that the cost of capital in the EU remains as low as possible overall for all EU economic actors, that European Union financial markets are properly regulated by European regulators, that European Union markets can grow strongly, that crossborder clearing and settlement costs are significantly reduced and that the European Union, through its new regulatory regime, can influence and develop strongly its financial relations with the rest of the world, using its good emerging model of regulation as its passport.  The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is a key step towards positioning Europe as a global leader in financial services. That is why the Commission is particularly thankful to Parliament for its cooperation on this vital subject.
8695672 author: Alastair McNabb:  . Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present our interim report and I would like to thank our secretariat, the Chairman of our committee and the members for their support and work. The starting point for this report has been a disastrous personal event for thousands of EU citizens: the loss of their pension investments. The challenge now for us as the European Parliament is to exercise our supervisory powers over EU legislation. We have perhaps a onceinageneration chance to look in detail at the implementation process of EU law, taking one particular directive as an example. Did we the institutions get it right? Did the Member States get it right? How can we do better in the future? This fits well with our wider, better legislation agenda.  In presenting the interim report, first let me deal with two items regarding the process: one general and one particular. This is the first such committee of inquiry in ten years. Each time we have the chance to learn how to do this better in future, to build our own institutional knowledge.  We have, as always, been asked to produce an interim report but, to report properly we need all the evidence, all the studies, all the answers to our inquiries to be available. Having to produce an interim report as a matter of form is something of a distraction, although of course we like to keep our colleagues informed as to where we are. Maybe we can think about this question for the future.  This brings me to the particular aspect. Our inquiry is about the EU aspects of this case. Others have already made extensive inquiries in the UK and another, even more indepth inquiry is due from the British Parliamentary Ombudsman in November  2006 . It would be foolish for us to publish our report in advance of the information that report is likely to contain. The UK Ombudsman has had substantial access to many UK actors in this drama. It makes no sense for us to repeat the exercise, but equally it would make no sense for us not to take account of these findings. Hence we will need a little more time. This is foreseen in the report and we will ask the House to endorse our request for probably a couple more months to produce our final report.  Let me come to the ground that we have covered. This is set out mainly in the annex to the report. We have set up our working method, which involves a number of comparative studies; these have been commissioned. We have already heard a wealth of evidence, most importantly from many of the victims. Their stories have been heartrending. They have made me angry  angry that they have been let down by their experience of our internal market for financial services. For them it has not produced extra choice, but rather the loss of life savings with no redress mechanisms available.  We have learnt more details about the Commissions implementation checks  or rather I should say checklist. Maybe we need to look for more checks in the future. We have seen the difficulty of inserting EU legislation into the existing fabric of Member States legal and regulatory systems. It does not always fit. We have seen that we can raise undue expectations by what is written in EU law particularly, in this instance, about the availability of compensatory mechanisms. When it gets to MemberState level, maybe something gets lost in translation.  Then there is the big missing part of the jigsaw: access to justice. Where is this in a countryoforigin regime? Let this be the real lesson to all of us. In this inquiry we have heard from victims sent from pillar to post. The Commission has now admitted, in a note to us on home and host country authorities, that this does not work. Let me read: The directive can only work smoothly if there is good cooperation between home and host state authorities. It is not a satisfactory situation, where aggrieved policyholders are referred by the host state authority to the home state authority and are then sent back by the home to the host authority, thus to find themselves unable to have their case examined by either. The Commission plans to seek further discussions with Member States. I should jolly well hope so! If this inquiry does nothing else, I hope that we can put this injustice right.  That is an indication of where we have got to as of now; there will be much more to come.
5225752 author: Jennifer Bauer:  . Mr President, in the few minutes I have this evening, I am going to follow current financial trends and consolidate my opening remarks in covering both Mr Muscats report and the oral question by Mrs Bers on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  As I emphasised during the hearing organised by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in January, the real debate cannot be on more or less crossborder consolidation. That is for the market players to decide, not the politicians. Rather, the core of the debate is on how to create the optimal regulatory and prudential framework for the European financial sector to thrive, delivering concrete and substantial benefits to the consumers and boosting economic growth and job creation.  That is why I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, and members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their work. With such complex issues, it is not always easy to identify the real questions, to take into account all the different points of view and strike the right balance to set the way forward. Thanks to the rapporteurs open, transparent and inclusive approach, the report does just that. It brings a substantial contribution to the debate.  I believe that there is a broad consensus on the main obstacles identified, shared by the Council conclusions adopted by the Ecofin Council in May.  We must improve the cost efficiency of the supervision of crossborder activities. In that respect, as noted in the report, further convergence of supervisory practices and standards is essential. To achieve this objective, we do not need a supervisory big bang, but rather to optimise the functioning of the Lamfalussy structure. There are concrete projects that can be implemented rather soon. The role of the Level  3  Committees is essential, for instance to implement common reporting standards and thus avoid costly and unnecessary duplicative requirements. A number of such concrete improvements have been identified and were endorsed by the Ecofin Council last May.  I would like to give a push to accelerating work in this area. We cannot have an internal market if companies are going to have to keep underutilised capital tied up because we do not have in place sufficient cooperation between supervisors. I intend to come back to that in the time ahead. There is a regulatory and supervisory cost that should be evaluated.  The report rightly underlines the implications of increasing integration for supervision. Some complex questions, such as deposit guarantee schemes or the issue of lender of last resort, must be reexamined in that context. The Commissions White Paper on financial services policy has identified those questions. This will surely be one of the most interesting policy debates for the coming months and years.  Besides supervision, the fragmentation of retail markets must also be addressed. The current difficulties in selling similar retail products in different countries is a major stumbling block in exploiting scale synergies.  I fully agree with the report that further integration, notably in the retail market segments, should not occur to the detriment of consumers. We have means to prevent that from happening and we will use them. The ongoing sectoral inquiries, under the supervision of my colleague Commissioner Kroes, are a good example.  A third area calling for our attention is the one related to impediments to corporate reorganisation on a panEuropean basis. We are currently consulting on future priorities for company law and corporate governance to identify how we could make further progress.  I would like to thank the rapporteur again for his work. We now have a shared analysis of what the main obstacles are. Our challenge for the coming years will be to remove them.  Turning to the oral question by Mrs Bers, let me be clear: the Commission believes strongly that market forces and shareholder choices should determine the optimal shape of exchange consolidation  not bureaucrats, not politicians. We should not be in the business of picking winners or trying to shape markets according to a bureaucratic vision of what is best for European shareholders, investors and issuers.  In the long run, European investors and European corporations seeking to raise capital will be best served by worldclass institutions doing business in a worldclass regulatory framework deploying cuttingedge technology and able to provide the breadth and range of services they want. Those services might include the ability to trade in a multitude of currencies, timezones and instruments. There are strong commercial pressures driving consolidation. If a deal makes commercial sense, and if the competition law and regulatory aspects can be adequately dealt with, then we will not stand in the way.  However  and this is the key point  the Commission considers that it is essential that financial market business in the jurisdiction of the European Union is regulated by European and Member State rules, and by our regulators. Of course we will be very vigilant to ensure that current levels of investor protection and market integrity will be maintained. We believe in strong and effective regulation of European marketplaces. Otherwise, we would not all have put so much effort into getting the MiFID right, as well as the other aspects of the Financial Services Action Plan that we have laboured on for so long together.  We note the preliminary assessment from some regulators in Europe and the United States that the mergers being discussed will not mean significant changes of regulatory responsibility. But if there are any spillovers, regulators should work out constructively together what the rules are going to be and how to cooperate.  I will be maintaining close contact with the college of Euronext supervisors in the time ahead so as to ensure there is a full understanding about how all these issues will evolve.  So there is no question of imposing new, extraterritorial burdens on European businesses that would put us at a disadvantage and jeopardise our internationally successful and developing financial markets. We know European users and shareholders do not favour that either.  On competition issues, the Commissions competences in merger assessment are laid down in the EC Merger Regulation No  1392004 . Within this framework, it is up to the parties in the first instance to inform the Commission as to whether, in their view, the relevant turnover thresholds are met for Community competence. The New York Stock Exchange and Euronext have informed us that this transaction would not meet these thresholds.  On clearing and settlement issues, in the course of our work we have been trying to determine the best range of measures  legislative or not  that will deliver improved competitiveness in these areas. As regards the steps needed to deliver those benefits, the Commission has not yet taken a decision. All options remain on the table; a decision will probably be taken shortly.
9596337 author: James McNabb:  . Mr President, a range of issues has been brought up this evening. I believe I have covered 30 of the EUs oil imports and 45 of our gas imports. Or, to be more exact, 25 of our consumed gas. As a result, Russia is the largest single external energy supplier. A considerable amount of our Iranian imports are also provided by Russia, so the EU and Russian markets for crude oil and oil products, as well as natural gas, are tightly interlinked with numerous pipelines, maritime and rail links and numerous contracts that our companies have concluded with Russian suppliers. A broad relationship and energy dialogue was established between Russia and the Commission in 2000 . Moreover, the common economic space agreed during the EURussia Summit in May 2005 includes cooperation in a wide range of energyrelated activities. So the energy dialogue aims to discuss issues related to energy policy and market developments, infrastructure developments, and EURussia cooperation in multilateral energy fora. I believe that Russia will remain an important supplier for the EU in the future. Taking into account the expected growth of energy consumption in the EU, I expect Russia to continue to supply around 25 of the gas consumed in the EU which, in absolute terms, would mean an increase in supplies. The European Union and many countries worldwide are becoming ever more dependent on imported hydrocarbons. I would like to reiterate that in the long term there are only three countries that have a lot of natural gas resources: Russia, Iran and Qatar. At the same time, the EU will import 70 of its energy in 2030 , compared with 50 most of them in my introductory remarks, but let me stress a few points.  A lot of effort has gone into creating a harmonised legal framework for the EUs financial markets. Indeed, a lot of work is still being done on that. The framework is aimed at creating a level playing field, promoting deeper and more liquid markets and ensuring that consumers and investors interests are safeguarded. Within that framework, we should allow the market to play its role. Regulators should steer away from intervening in decisions taken by market players. The fact that European companies are coveted by operators from other countries is a sign of the confidence they have in us and in our regulatory model. What we need are strong financial institutions that can stand their own in the global economy. We need stateoftheart exchanges, and competition policy ensures that undue concentration and abuses of dominant positions are avoided. But beyond that, I believe that we should allow the market to play its role.  Mrs van den Burg raised a number of questions. She said that in her opinion it was not just a decision for the shareholders  referring to stock exchanges. Well, I believe it is. I do not agree with her. I agree with her that users of exchanges have an interest, but I have not noted any degree of consensus between them as to what they consider to be the best and most desirable combination of exchanges.  She also raised the question of the consequences of the possible mergers. It is too early to tell, but I made it clear that consolidation of exchanges should not lead to what I call regulatory spillover. That issue has been referred to by other speakers too, such as Mr Klinz and others.  As I said in my opening remarks, in reply to Mrs Bers question on behalf of the committee, there are two separate issues. It is a matter, in my view, for the stakeholders and shareholders to decide what they want to do with their stock exchanges. That is a matter entirely for them. The market should decide that.  On the other hand, the question of our regulation is of great interest to us. We want to ensure that European regulators regulate European exchanges, and as I understand it, the proposal put to the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext will ensure a system where that will be allowed. I agree that it will be important to ensure that this remains the situation into the future  not just this year or next year, but four or five years hence  and that whatever procedures are put in place, they have to be followed through. As I said in m opening remarks, yes, we are taking an interest in that and will be involved in it.  Mrs van den Burg asked if I had read Mr Seiferts book. I have not, but I have read various comments about it. I met Mr Seifert early on in my time as European Commissioner, just after he launched the tentative takeover by Frankfurt of the London Stock Exchange. I have read what he said in his book. Whereas the book is interesting, it is just one perspective on the subject.  I should like to say to Members of this House and others outside, who always seem to be concerned about outside influences contaminating the European experience, that I believe that some of the proposals on the table at present suggest to me that market players worldwide seem to want to be involved in the European experience and see it somewhat in the other way. Evidence seems to suggest that a lot of business is now done in Europe that used to be done on the other side of the Atlantic. There is a reason for that. Some people want to get involved in the European way. We should not always be so defensive.  Mr Hkmark and others referred to the regulatory matter. I would agree with what they say. We should let European rules and regulations apply to European companies. That is what our interest is going to be. The question of whether there should be takeovers or mergers of stock exchanges in different parts of the world is entirely a matter for the market players and one about which I am entirely agnostic.
1136596 author: Roger MacLeod:  . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Alvaro, rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and Mr Bullmann, draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their outstanding efforts and readiness to reach an agreement on this technical and complex file.  The proposal for a regulation on payer information accompanying the transfer of funds is an important step towards our aim of cutting off terrorist funding. It shows the EUs determination to participate fully in the international efforts to combat terrorism.  Nobody can deny that combating terrorism is a key political priority worldwide today. At European level, the commitment to combat all forms of terrorism is clear. The EU plan of action on combating terrorism defines as a priority close cooperation with the Financial Action Task Force and the adaptation of the EU legislative framework to the nine special recommendations on terrorist financing adopted by this body.  The proposed regulation transposes into EU law Special Recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force. This recommendation requires that money transfers be accompanied by the identity of the sender with name, address and account number.  This regulation will facilitate the traceability of money transfers through a number of obligations. These obligations apply to payment service providers, mainly banks, but also money remitters. They will be obliged to send information on the payer throughout the payment chain and keep the corresponding records. This information shall be available to the national authorities in order to assist them in their tasks. It will help combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  The agreed deadline for the implementation of this special recommendation is  1  January  2007 . Noncoordinated action by Member States alone in the field of crossborder transfers of funds could have a significant negative impact on the smooth functioning of payment services at EU level. It would also damage the internal market in the field of financial services: hence the importance of respecting the deadline.  Parliament, the Council and the Commission have worked hard during the last year to reach an agreement on the text. We all have done our best to find solutions to complex issues and I believe that we have been successful in doing so.  One of the main topics of discussion in our negotiations has been the issue of the EUR  1000  threshold, below which receiving banks in the EU would not be obliged to reject a transfer or to ask the sending bank to complete the information on the payer. The Commission is pleased that this option has finally not been retained. This idea has also been rejected by all Member States in the Council. Terrorists can be financed by a series of small payments below the threshold. I consider this a valid concern if we want to tackle terrorism effectively.  A solution has also been found with respect to the obligation of the receiving banks to stop dealings with foreign banks not sending the appropriate information, and on the obligation to send back lowvalue payments. I have noted Parliaments concerns on these points. The circumstances under which these obligations apply have been restricted considerably, making them a solution of last resort.  I am also happy to note that we have been successful in reaching agreement on technical issues, such as the use of systems with technical limitations by intermediaries receiving funds from outside the EU.  Now that an overall agreement on comitology has been reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the adoption of this regulation is an excellent opportunity to put into practice that agreement. I am therefore appealing to the Members of this House not to insist on the inclusion of specific sunset clauses on the Commissions regulatory powers under this regulation.  All in all I think this proposal is ripe for adoption in a single reading and I hope it will receive support from all of you.  This regulation provides us with means to combat terrorist financing in a consistent manner throughout the European Union. I look forward to hearing your comments.
5019817 author: Marc Bauer:  . Mr President, for the record I wish to confirm that the Commission accepts all amendments that reflect the agreement allowing the adoption of this proposal in a single reading. I have arranged for a list of the Commissions position on all amendments to be handed to the secretariat for inclusion in the record( 1 ).  Some Members raised subjects this evening that are reflected in amendments that the Commission is not in a position to accept and these relate to the following. A threshold of  1000  euros or dollars for incoming transfers would deprive authorities in charge of fighting money laundering and terrorist financing of an effective means to do their job. Below the threshold, information on the payers would not have to be collected or recorded. The risk is that these funds could be used for financing new terrorist attacks.  Terrorist acts can be organised with little money. It has been estimated that the cost of the Madrid attacks only amounted to about EUR  8000  and any threshold for incoming transfers can easily be abused by dividing the amount to be transferred into several payments below the threshold.  The general sunset clause that would limit the applicability of this regulation in time: this was not accepted by the Council either. Such a clause could be useful in certain cases in the context of better regulation, but the Commission does not see added value in including this general clause in this regulation. Inserting this clause would mean that users and providers of payment services would be deprived of the necessary legal certainty.  A comprehensive review clause is no doubt better suited for this regulation. If it turns out in the light of the review that changes are needed, the Commission will set them in motion and I therefore appeal to the House to accept this sensible solution.  The comitology procedure under the provisions of this regulation covers a special procedure of authorisation by the Commission for Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with territories or countries outside the Community. Member States authorised to include such agreements will benefit from derogations from the obligations under the regulation. Such waivers will allow Member States to treat transfers of funds between that country or territory and the Member State concerned as transfers of funds within the Member State.  Amendment  103  limits in time, until  1  April  2008 , the possibility for the Commission to grant such authorisations. Imposing such a sunset clause is clearly not in line with the recent agreement on the revised comitology procedure. As part of this deal both the Council and Parliament agreed not to limit in time the powers granted to the Commission. For the same reasons, Amendments  20 ,  22  and  24  are not acceptable either.  Some of you have raised the SWIFT crisis widely reported in the media during the last few weeks. You are aware that the issue is on Parliaments agenda later this week and my colleague Mr Frattini will make a declaration on behalf of the Commission. We will make sure that we have all the facts of this case before taking any decision on further action.  As far as this regulation is concerned, the Commission considers that it contains the appropriate standards on data protection and access by the competent authorities to such data. Your rapporteur had the foresight to submit the proposal to the European Data Protection Supervisor, who gave a positive assessment. No problems were detected on data protection issues.  Let me stress once more that noncompliance by  1 January  2007  with the agreed international standards to ensure an effective fight against the financing of terrorism will not only send a negative message to the financial community on Europes commitment to fight terrorism. Noncompliance would also have significant economic consequences due to disruption of money flows from and to the European Union.  The Commission has been ready to take the concerns on board. The compromise found is a good one. It will make Europe a safer place and show that Europe lives up to its responsibilities in the world. I count on your support in bringing this dossier to a successful conclusion now at first reading, thus avoiding lengthy discussions and probably less satisfactory results at second reading.
1784757 author: Annette LaCourt:  . Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I warmly welcome the Commissions communication on reducing the climate impact of aviation and that my report strongly supports the Commissions position that a comprehensive package of measures is needed to address the full impact of aviation on the climate. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their good work and collaboration.  The starting point for my report is that while aviation has brought a great many benefits to society, its current growth rate is completely unsustainable. Between  1990  and  2003 , the EUs international aviation emissions increased by  73 , corresponding to an annual growth of over  4 . At this rate the increased emissions from aviation will neutralise more than a quarter of the reductions required by the EUs Kyoto target by  2012 . Moreover, crucially, aviations total impact on the climate is estimated to be two to four times the CO 2  impact, even without considering the potential effects of cirrus cloud enhancement.  Of course, the industrys efforts to reduce its emissions are welcome. However, as Eurocontrol predicts, EU air traffic movements are set to more than double by  2020  compared to  2003 . It is clear that rates of technological improvements  which historically run at about  12  per year  will be insufficient to offset this enormous growth.  It is clear then that action is urgently needed. International aviation is not subject to Kyoto or other commitments. Article  2 ( 2 ) of the Kyoto Protocol urges states to pursue reduction of greenhouse gases from this source through the International Civil Aviation Organization, but there are currently no plans for a global solution here. That makes it vital that the EU shows leadership and exploits the advantages of laying down an example with early regional action. Council Conclusions of December  2005  reaffirm this, calling for specific action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation if no such action is agreed within the ICAO by  2002 .  I therefore welcome the communications recognition that we need this comprehensive package of measures, including regulatory, economic, technological and operational instruments. In particular, its plan to pursue the introduction of kerosene taxes is very important, given the existing imbalance between the treatment of aviation and other modes of transport. This should begin right away with a tax on all domestic and intraEU flights  with the possibility of exemption for all carriers on routes where nonEU carriers operate. The ongoing renegotiations of air service agreements must continue so that thirdcountry carriers can gradually be taxed on an equal basis with EU carriers.  Ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field, and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits. Colleagues will see that I have brought back an amendment to seek to achieve this.  Improvements in air traffic management could reduce average fuel burn by between  8  and  18 , with resultant decreases in all engine emissions.  All of these measures are necessary, but the main focus of the Commissions proposals and therefore of my report is on emissions trading. I agree that it has the potential to play a role, but only provided any scheme is properly designed. First, it is clear that other policy instruments must be introduced alongside an emissions trading system to address the full climatic impact. Instruments directly linked to the impact in question, such as a NOx charge, would be most likely to induce the most efficient behaviour, although multipliers on CO 2  emissions are an interim alternative. This is crucial, because if there is not a parallel emissions charge or multiplier formula to cover aviations nonCO 2  impacts, the effect of buying the right to emit a tonne of CO 2  from another sector with much lower nonCO 2  impacts would actually be a net disbenefit to the environment.  Second, and crucially, a separate closed system for aviation is crucial at the very least as a pilot scheme because, apart from the administrative difficulties of including aviation in the EUs general ETS, many sectors already in that scheme are concerned about the possible effect of aviations inclusion on carbon prices, noting that as a sheltered sector, aviation will be able tolerate higher prices than many others. There is a very real risk that excessive pressure on vulnerable, energyintensive industries could lead to a loosening of the overall cap.  It would also be impractical for aviation to join the general ETS before  2012 . I do not think we can afford to wait another six years before we act, so good use could be made of the period  20082012  by running at least a pilot scheme. Any arrangement by which aviation was ultimately incorporated into a wider ETS would also need a cap on the number of emission rights the aviation sector could buy from the market to ensure that aviation itself begins to make some of these cuts.  Finally, if colleagues are in any doubt about the importance of a separate scheme, they should consider the words of a chief economist of British Airways, who admitted last week that if airlines joined the existing emissions trading system their emissions would simply continue to grow at an alarming rate: they would simply buy up the right to emit as ever, their own emissions would not go down, and we would still see aviation having a massive accountability for the climate crisis.  Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote for this report, which will send a very clear signal to the Commission and to the Council that Parliament is looking for ambitious but realistic proposals in this field.
2639975 author: Katarina Bauer:  . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking you for your continuous support and encouragement and for the role the European Parliament has played in preparing a reform of cohesion policy.  First of all, let me say how much we appreciate your role in securing a significant financial envelope. Secondly, we appreciate your contribution to setting up a new architecture and also new instruments for this policy. You have insisted on establishing a more ambitious territorial cooperation objective. That objective has a considerable and clear European added value, in particular in the context of the enlargement of the European Union. I am sure that the increase of  4  in the financial resources available for this objective of reinforcing transnational and interregional cooperation, which had suffered the most substantial reductions in the European Council decision of December  2005 , will help us to be more efficient and more effective in bringing European regions across the continent together.  In addition, I would like to thank you for your support for developing a unique instrument designed to overcome the problems encountered by Member States, regions and local authorities in undertaking crossborder, transnational or interregional cooperation actions, whether funded by structural funds or not. For the first time ever, the EU will provide an adequate legal framework for enhanced crossborder, interregional and transnational cooperation.  Thirdly, I appreciate your role in ensuring that cohesion policy will apply to all regions and Member States and that it will contribute to more and better jobs and faster economic growth. In this context, I am also very happy that you welcomed our efforts to create new supporting instruments such as Jeremy and Jessica, which will bring in new partners and expertise from European financial institutions. That will address genuine market values and make the structural Funds work much harder.  Let me use this opportunity to express my personal thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Andria, MrSilva Peneda, Mr Fava and Mr Olbrycht, and to say how much we appreciated the role Mrs Krehl played as rapporteur for the Financial Perspective and her work on the Community Strategic Guidelines. Let me also thank Mr Beaupuy, without whose commitment the urban dimension would probably not be so prominent in our new policy.  It was a pleasure to work with Mr Galeote, Chairman of the Committee on Regional Development, whom I thank very much for his commitment. He always maintained a very constructive and cooperative spirit and we shared the same principles and priorities throughout the negotiations.  Jointly we have managed to avoid a policy based on a system of double standards in the application of the rules on the eligibility of nonrecoverable VAT and in the application of the principle of total eligible cost as the basis of cofinancing.  We will not have two distinct cohesion policies for Europe, one for the old and one for the new Member States. That would have been, I believe, at odds with our efforts to produce an efficient and coherent policy, with transparency, with sound financial management and with simplified regulations.  You have shared our insistence on the need to strengthen the partnership principle. We have jointly reinforced the role of NGOs, local and civil society and the environmental partners in our policy. With your support we have also strengthened the provisions on nondiscrimination and sustainable development. However, there are a number of items where we failed fully to convince our Member States of their added value. I am thinking here of the concept of a Community reserve, of our intention to render the urban dimension of our policy mandatory and of Parliaments idea of recycling the potentially unspent resources allocated to cohesion policy.  As requested by Parliament, the Commission has prepared a joint declaration in which the Commission commits itself to presenting an assessment of the budgetary execution of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the  20072013  programming period, including the consequences of the implementation of the decommitment rule.  Our major concern in the months to come is to ensure that the new, goodquality cohesion programmes will start on time. Much remains to be done. We are working with the Finnish Presidency to ensure that the Community strategy guidelines on cohesion can be adopted by the Council after the European Parliament has delivered its opinion. I understand that we can achieve that at the end of September or early October. The Member States will then formally present their national strategies concerning how they propose to use cohesion policy, after which we will discuss in detail the operational programmes, with final adoption by the Commission.  In order to save time the Commission has already entered into informal discussions. We have already received the draft national programmes from  21  Member States.  We are gradually completing the preparation of the new  20072013  generation, but we have to think longterm to ensure that cohesion policy will continue to support convergence and the economic and social modernisation of Europe. The Fourth Cohesion Report  due for publication in spring next year  and the Cohesion Forum to be held at that time will be important steps and will flesh out the ideas for the future.  I look forward to your debate, convinced that your decision today will allow us successfully to finalise preparations for the new generation of our common cohesion policy.
3674732 author: Helen Cameron:  . Mr President, with the Finnish Presidencys emphasis on productivity, accountability and transparency, Finlandia is music to Liberal ears.  The programme you have presented today, PresidentinOffice, reflects both the strong reforming tendencies of your government and the egalitarian and innovative impulses of a nation which repeatedly tops the league tables for education, innovation and development. Liberal values will be on the march with your Presidency.  I would like to refer to just a few areas which my group feels to be important. First, the marketdriven programme. Priorities like completing the internal market, particularly in services and the energy sector, are key goals for us in the months ahead, as are efforts to deliver a directive on the portability of supplementary pensions and promoting market openings for new technologies. The latter will pay more longterm dividends than any governmentfunded initiatives on research and development, and provide the growth and jobs and prosperity that our Union desperately needs.  As regards Article  42   justice and home affairs  your Presidency is right to focus on areas where European Union legislation adds value to citizens lives, but in the modern world a wanted man can be halfway across Europe before the policeman has his boots on. It beggars belief that the law still has borders, when criminals do not. For too long, key initiatives on police and judicial cooperation have been stalled in the Council, and even those decisions taken lack the democratic scrutiny that protects our human rights and civil liberties, as we have seen with the inadequacies of data protection legislation.  PresidentinOffice, the time has come to heed our call to apply the footbridge clause provided for in Article  42  and to make policy in justice and home affairs democratically.  The transparency initiative, which has found one of its key supporters in your Presidency, is one way out of this antidemocratic culdesac. Liberals and Democrats seek your assurance that safeguard clauses will be used sparingly or not at all. But true transparency requires that the transposition, implementation and enforcement of legislation be given much more attention than it has to date.  Three years ago, we demanded that Member States draw up concordance tables showing how they transposed EU directives into national law. Let citizens see for themselves which parts of the law come from Brussels and which reflect the hobbyhorses of national governments. Otherwise, poor implementation and goldplating will continue to fuel the fire of Brusselsbashers. Yet, since your Presidency started three days ago, I see changes are already afoot. The comitology decision, which gives Parliament the right of recall, giving us equal powers to Council to make sure the law is applied, is a very important step. With greater power comes greater responsibility and I hope that our House will bear that in mind when it meets today to discuss muchneeded parliamentary reform.  PresidentinOffice, you have a big agenda: the agenda of dealing with Asia and the ASEM Summit; the agenda of dealing with Russia. We wish you success in this and we ask you to think not just of engagement, but of promotion of European values, of human rights and democracy, so essential to the development of our world. We wish you success in finding a way forward to an agreement in the WTO, so valuable to our economy and that of developing countries, and we wish you great success with enlargement, though we know that is also in the hands of another very competent Finn, Commissioner Rehn, who is here with us today.  In conclusion, you spoke about public fears of globalisation. These can best be overcome by developing a European consciousness. As Lnnrot did for Finland in the Kalevala, we need to draw on aspects of our common history to create a common consciousness.  I wish you the wisdom of Vinminen. I hope that for the peoples lasting pleasure you compose mighty songs for Europes children.  For his peoples lasting pleasure, mighty songs for Suomis children.
10319856 author: Frederic Smith:  . Mr President, we are all extremely concerned by the events unfolding in the Palestinian territories. These are very disturbing times: the insecurity, the interfactional violence, the Qassam rockets, the shellings. The attack by militant Palestinian factions in Karem Shalom and the abduction of the Israeli soldier, followed by the Israeli military incursion into Gaza, signal a very worrying escalation.  In its statement last week, the European Union strongly condemned these acts, and we have just heard what the PresidentinOffice of the Council has said. Last week I called on both sides to take a step back, to exercise restraint. I now repeat that call. All sides need to consider their responsibility extremely carefully. All parties must abstain from any actions that are in violation of international law and we must insist that the Palestinian leadership do all in its power to end violence and terrorist activities. The European Union has called for the immediate and unconditional release of Corporal Gilad Shalit. This kind of act can only make things worse for the Palestinian people, as we are seeing.  But we must also look to the Israelis to act with prudence. We understand their outrage, but diplomacy offers the best chance to address the immediate priority, not the destruction of essential infrastructure, the detention of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council or the shelling of the Prime Ministers office.  Recent events have considerably worsened the situation of the Palestinian population, and that is, I must say, a source of both sorrow and deep frustration for us. The damage to Gazas only power station has deprived hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of electricity and could have serious humanitarian consequences.  Everything must be done to prevent the humanitarian situation from deteriorating further. Israel has to understand its responsibilities for the wellbeing of the Palestinian population and an immediate step has to be the restoration of electricity to the Palestinian territories. Both sides need to step back from the brink before this becomes a crisis that neither can control.  We must do all we can to avoid an unacceptable economic and humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories. Even before the latest events, we were looking at a  30  fall in income, unemployment at  40  and poverty levels of  67 . But responsible politicians cannot give in to frustration. I visited Israel and the Palestinian territories only two weeks ago. The principal aim of my visit then was to bring Israel and President Abbas up to speed with the European Council and the Quartet decisions on a temporary international mechanism. The mechanism is designed to provide immediate relief to the Palestinian people and to ensure that basic services are provided. Discussions were positive, but there is no doubt that events in Gaza and the West Bank have greatly complicated this effort. Now, more than ever, there is a need to press ahead with the mechanism to help meet at least the basic needs of ordinary Palestinians.  A number of donors have indicated their willingness to make funds available through the mechanism. But the needs will be great and funds are limited. The Commission has therefore sought the budgetary authoritys approval to transfer funds from the emergency reserve. I am very grateful for the support of the European Parliament in this difficult endeavour and I am especially grateful for the many very valuable exchanges of views I was able to have with the committee chairmen and leaders in my discussions with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, at the forefront in setting up this mechanism.  It is our collective responsibility as Europeans to help the Palestinians and to give peace a chance. I look forward to your continued support on that.  Let us be clear. The mechanism cannot be a panacea for all the difficulties faced in the Palestinian territories. Donors cannot be a substitute for the responsibilities of the Palestinian Government, which must take real steps to comply with the Quartets principles and end the violence that threatens the lives of Israelis and Palestinians alike. Nor can donors be a substitute for the responsibilities of Israel under international law, for freeing up movement and access, for releasing Palestinian customs and tax revenues, or for the recent damage caused to key civil infrastructure.  The events of recent days have undermined a fragile process that has just begun with the meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert in Amman. As my colleague has said, these events come at a time when progress was being made on a national consensus agreement between Hamas and Fatah, based on the prisoners initiative. It remains to be seen whether this tentative agreement for a government of national unity will produce a leadership better able to meet its responsibilities.  I have commended President Abbas for taking this initiative, but at the same time I have been clear that it is not an end in itself, but only the start of a process. The Palestinian Government must ultimately commit itself to renouncing violence, to recognising Israel and to respecting previous agreements as set out by the Quartet.  We are faced with a very grave crisis situation in the Middle East. We have to work together to deescalate the tension and to give diplomacy a chance. Because in all the chaos and confusion of the current situation, one thing is clear: a negotiated twostate solution is the only way to guarantee the security that ordinary people  Israelis and Palestinians as well as others  desire.
8480770 author: Claire Brown:  . Mr President, I suspect that there was a plot in this House in scheduling this debate right now, because it was expected that this would be the time at which England would have been playing against France. Mr Daul and I, having been involved in these negotiations, felt we were the victims of this plot. But, as we know, England did not qualify, so perhaps it matters somewhat less  at least for me.  We have before us technically two reports for procedural reasons, but they concern a single package: the proposed revision of the  1999  Council decision on comitology and the joint declarations which, because they constitute a sort of interinstitutional agreement, are subject to a separate report. They are globally a package and together they represent a huge step forward for Parliament  a major transformation of the comitology system.  My constituents back home in Yorkshire would be asking me what comitology is. It is not exactly the subject they are talking about day in, day out in the pubs and clubs of Yorkshire. Every legislature has a system of delegating powers to the executive. In national parliaments that is typically legislation that confers on the government powers to adopt further measures: the statutory instrument in the UK, the in Belgium, decrees in various other countries. The systems change slightly, but it is quite normal to confer powers on the executive, not least to deal with technical details and complex matters once the main legislation has laid down the general principles.  What is unusual in our system in the European Union is that, when we confer such powers on the Commission, we oblige it to act in conjunction with a committee of national civil servants. In many cases those committees have the power to block the Commission and refer the matter back to the Council. We have always found that objectionable: firstly because only committees of national civil servants and not Parliament have the right to scrutinise the Commission and refer questions back, and secondly because matters are referred back only to one branch of the legislative authority  the Council  even when the basic act has been adopted under codecision.  We also found the system to be thoroughly untransparent and complex with the numerous committees that give rise to the name of comitology. Only an expert could study it and understand it.  Over the years we have obtained small concessions. We now receive every document that is sent to a comitology committee. Since  1999  we have had some power to object within a certain time limit if we think that a measure goes beyond the powers that have been delegated. However, up to now, our fundamental objections have been unanswered. With this agreement there is a transformation of the situation: henceforth Parliament will be able to say no to any implementing measure of a quasilegislative nature adopted through the comitology system, and if we say no the measure cannot be enacted. The Commission will either have to put forward a new proposal or table new legislation under the codecision procedure. That is a huge step forward for Parliament  and not just for Parliament  in terms of the accountability and transparency of the whole Union system. That is why this agreement is so important.  Nonetheless, there have been some issues with which we have been ill at ease and where we had to negotiate to ensure that our position was fully safeguarded. For instance, we have in this agreement a reference to the Lamfalussy . Indeed, by mentioning it, as regards the Commission, we are actually upgrading that from a mere statement in Parliament by the Commission President and a letter from the relevant Commissioner to the relevant committee chairman, to a declaration by the whole institution. So we have upgraded the relevant parts of the Lamfalussy . That is also important.  We have gained satisfaction on time limits: it is an important step forward that three months can be extended to four, especially  as Commissioner Wallstrm pointed out  as the clock starts running once we get the text in all the languages. That will give us adequate time to consider these matters.  There has also been this issue of sunset clauses. I think that with this agreement Parliament will not normally need to use sunset clauses. We used them before, because when we delegated powers to the Commission we lost those powers for ever. With very loose control over how they were exercised, it was quite normal that we wanted to use sunset clauses as a way of reasserting control if need be. However, with this agreement we can say no to any implementing measures we dislike, even every single one of them, if we are dealing with quasilegislative measures.  We therefore do not need to use sunset clauses. The agreement reflects that  in that we acknowledge that the principles of good legislation mean that powers should be delegated without a sunset clause, without a time limit. But the principle that the legislature should, if necessary, be able to set a sunset clause  that is a power we have under the Treaty  is recognised to the extent that the agreement says very clearly without prejudice to the rights of the legislative authority. As is said, we do have the right, but I believe that we will not need to use it except perhaps in exceptional circumstances that we cannot foresee at present. We recognised that as part of the negotiations, because the other institutions felt very strongly about it, but also, in my opinion, because as a parliament we realised that we will not need to do so.  With this agreement we should be more relaxed about delegating matters to the Commission because we will have that control afterwards. We have the ludicrous situation in our Union where we sometimes have two or three readings on subjects such as the width of tyres for tractors, which in any national context would have been delegated to the government to deal with  this is because we have been reluctant to delegate. With the assurance that we can control what we delegate, there is no reason for us not to delegate much more and more frequently. That is another reason for welcoming this agreement.  That is why my group and our committee, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, rejected the amendments to which the Commissioner referred. It is only a recital  Parliament is not reaffirming the resolution to which it refers  but I do not see the need for a reference. My group  and I think other groups too  may be voting against this amendment if it is indeed confirmed by the group that tabled it. I will be listening to other speakers with interest in a minute.  There is a remaining issue: the adaptation of existing legislation. Commissioner Wallstrm referred to the package of  25  measures that will be adapted urgently, with a proposal by the end of this year. Beyond that the Commission has undertaken to carry out a survey of all existing legislation to see what needs to be adapted and will make a proposal. But we have no undertaking from the Council to act within any given timetable, so we as a Parliament will have to watch that very carefully. We have a ceasefire. I do not want to break the ceasefire, but we will have to watch very carefully that the Council looks at this seriously within the necessary timetable. So this may not be completely the end of the story, but nonetheless I think it is a huge breakthrough, a huge advance for Parliament.  I would like to finish in the way that Commissioner Wallstrm began, which is to thank all those involved. Certainly my thanks are due to the Commission. Its position is completely different to the Commissions position of a few years ago and I think Commissioner Wallstrm can take much of the credit for that. The Commission has moved to a position where it was very supportive of our position. I think our positions were virtually identical for most of these negotiations.  I would like to thank the British and the Austrian Presidencies: the British Presidency that initiated the resumption of the Councils consideration of this matter, the Austrian Presidency that took it forward so ably. Of course I would like to thank my fellow negotiator, Mr Daul, the Chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen. We went through many meetings together over a sixmonth period. I am very glad that tonight I can report to this packed House  at least those Members who are not watching the football!  that we have a very important result which I think is not just good for this Parliament, but is actually good for our Union.
8460336 author: Sarah Brown:  . Madam President, I would like straightaway to thank MrSchmidt for this report and for drawing attention to my increasingly conspicuous consumption habits, which, I am afraid, are becoming only too obvious as I grow into this job as Europes Trade Commissioner. Sincerely and warmly I would like to thank him for this report, which I think is very valuable and will be well received.  Fair Trade is one of the key tools, in my view, to enhance sustainable development and to equip us better to fight poverty in the world, and as a concept it is developing fast. It is undoubtedly a very popular trade practice. It is gaining in currency and appeal with public opinion, and helps to raise public awareness about all the issues that are involved in sustainability.  You are not just undertaking an act of consumption that is good in terms of the content of what you consume. It is also a stimulus to the brain. It makes you think and therefore it is even more valuable. Consumers do take into account considerations about the conditions of production. People care, they do not just eat, and Fair Trade has pioneered this in a most attractive way.  The Commission actively supports Fair Trade. We took on commitments to Fair Trade in the Cotonou Agreement with the ACP countries, as well as in our communication on policy coherence for development.  Many trade and development assistance projects support Fair Trade: development projects to the tune of over EUR  4  million in  2003 , and growing. These consist mainly of support for NGO activities, but also of direct aid to the harmonisation of standards at work. We also participate in Fair Trade events.  One could argue that whilst Fair Trade helps salve the conscience of those who buy such products, others continue, nonetheless, to exploit the needy. I am not happy about that argument: Fair Trade is not a panacea for all the problems of poor producers, nor does it necessarily mean that because you are not buying and consuming Fair Trade products you are exploiting the poor.  What is required to tackle poverty and to enhance development is a general and coherent policy framework. It is this that we need to develop, to conceptualise, and this report will help us to do so.  Fair Trade is private and limited to the participating producers, while the UN Millennium Development Goals are for all. So Fair Trade is particular and specific, the Millennium Development Goals are general and wideranging; but there is a clear interconnection between the two. The objective is different for an individual and for EU policymaking.  An individual makes a personal choice. He or she is entitled to exercise that choice. You cannot automatically translate that into a more wideranging policy. The individual consumer looks at one packet of coffee, rightly. Policymakers, on the other hand, have to take into account the sector as a whole and our obligations to that sector as a whole.  We need a complete and public solution  one that should not be confined, therefore, to Fair Trade only. As the report rightly points out, there are other nonFair Trade operators that can achieve similar results to those obtained by Fair Traders, that have the same growth potential and that can influence consumer choice and the international trading schemes. We should fully use the potential of all credible initiatives to support sustainability. That should be our test. Does it help, does it aid, does it take forward sustainability? If it does, that should govern our response and attitude to it.  Building on commitments taken previously, we want to explore with our partners the use of economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries, as well as other trade agreements, for including specific incentives targeted at improving market access for fair trade products. That is where I believe we can leverage our interest and leverage our commitment most beneficially.  It is very useful, therefore, that the report points to the danger of inappropriate national legislation in the field of Fair Trade. I am aware of some initiatives being taken that might harm the status that Fair Trade has already achieved. We need to be vigilant about these and to see, therefore, whether it is not better to take a more coherent and collective approach in order to leverage the greatest benefits for Fair Trade.  Conversely, too firm an adhesion to the particular approach embodied in Fair Trade would be at risk of being discriminatory against other systems, some of them acknowledged in your report, which have similar claims and that we can and should support.  You are right about the need to protect consumers, the question is how. I believe the role of policy is to ensure that messages given to consumers are accurate and transparent, and I am glad that this is also stressed in the report. We already have protection against misleading claims, but we might consider going further and help engage the consumer actively in the ethics of production.  I believe that there is scope for better information about claims schemes in general, and work is in progress on this. I will ask my services to look at how sustainability is enhanced by different certification and assurance schemes, including Fair Trade.  We will look at all the suggestions made in this report and of course keep Parliament informed of further developments. We need a dialogue with Parliament on a continuing basis. I am glad, therefore, that this report provides the framework, both for this dialogue and for the way in which we can, should and will take our commitment in this area further forward.  In conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur again for the quality of this report.
3769747 author: Nancy Green:  . Madam President, between  29  June and  1  July, Mariann Fischer Boel and I attended ministerial meetings in Geneva on the Doha Round of trade talks. We also met and remained in contact with the MEPs who were present in Geneva during those days. I would like to thank the honourable Members of this House for their effort and for their commitment. It is much appreciated by the Commission.  The ministerial meetings did not find agreement on the main parameters for reductions in tariffs and subsidies, in agriculture and industrial goods, the socalled modalities of the agreement which are necessary to move to the final stage in the talks.  We met several times with the ministers from the Group of Six, that is ourselves in Europe, the United States, Brazil, India, Japan and Australia. We also met in the Green Room format of  30  ministers and in the Trade Negotiations Committee, which brings together the entire WTO membership. There was no shortage of ministerial meetings and encounters, but the encounters were frankly better than the quality of the negotiations that took place within those encounters.  We went into the discussions stressing the EUs agreement with a principle expressed by Pascal Lamy beforehand, that the landing zone for an agreement would require effective real cuts in farm subsidies by all and real cuts in both agricultural and nonagricultural market access  real cuts in tariffs. We then specified that to capture such a basis for agreement we would on our side be prepared to move towards and close to the level of average cuts in farm tariffs proposed for developed countries by the G 20 , provided that others moved in concert, with a similar level of ambition in other areas of the negotiation.  We made it clear to our partners that we would not be prepared to meet every G 20  demand, in particular on the structure of the cuts. We pushed hard to establish a clear correspondence between the effort that we would make in agricultural market access and the effort that the United States in turn would have to make in the reduction of domestic subsidies close to the G 20  levels of average cut by us, to be matched by close to G 20  reductions of tradedistorting subsidies by the US.  The United States was the only major player to refuse to consider moving on this basis and declined to signal any room for further movement within this landing zone. Indeed, they demanded further significant moves by others in order only to sustain their present offer, which all others regard as insufficient.  We also made it clear that, if a negotiating landing zone was to be identified in agriculture, we would only take our position in this pillar to the limit of our flexibility if we got a fair result in nonagricultural market access, requiring real cuts in developed and advanced developing countries tariffs. That is economically doable and, I would argue, desirable for these developing countries and politically essential for us and for other developed countries. The United States unreadiness to engage stopped developing countries from making any move or showing any flexibility of their own.  The conclusions of the meeting therefore focused on the political handling of our failure to reach a breakthrough. All members reaffirmed a willingness to reach agreement by this summer. In this context G 6  members first, subsequently backed by the broader membership in the Trade Negotiations Committee, asked the DirectorGeneral, Pascal Lamy, to intensify consultations and act as a catalyst for generating the basis for an agreement in the coming few weeks. He has not been asked to author a final agreement or provide a Dunkeltype text, like the previous DirectorGeneral at the end of the Uruguay Round, but instead to use his good offices to act as a gobetween for a final agreement to emerge. That will require very active engagement by us with him and with the main players in the next ten days to two weeks.  Depending on progress made, it is likely that ministers will need to meet in a similar format towards or at the end of July to take the key decisions on modalities as well as to confirm progress made in the other key areas of the round, i.e. services, rules and the development package.  The possibility of a meeting of Heads of State and Government in some formation or another to take forward the negotiations around the time of the G 8  meeting in ten days is not ruled out. There is a lot at stake here and we shall have to work very hard and very fast in the coming days and weeks. Failure of the DDA would have severe consequences, not least for the developing countries. This is an opportunity that will not repeat itself to open markets further, to reduce subsidies, to strengthen world trade rules and to make a real contribution to growth in the poorest countries in the world. This is why these multilateral negotiations continue to be the EUs top trade priority. No number of bilateral deals would have the same widespread effects or benefits.  This being said, our trade agenda goes beyond achieving a successful Doha deal. In the months ahead, the Commission will define its commitment to boosting our competitive performance at home and abroad and this will be set out after the summer in an overarching Commission communication on the external aspects of Europes competitiveness. This will examine how future trade policy can contribute to our internal competitiveness policies and what the priority tasks are for us to build new and secure global markets for our investment and trade.  This will include a new strategic approach to market access, including nontariff barriers, the consideration of new bilateral and regional policy approaches and the examination of our political and economic ties with China. This is not, however, an alternative to the DDA: it is an extension of a successfully concluded end to this round. Our immediate priority remains, therefore, to bring about the necessary political engagement by all governments to negotiate a balanced and ambitious end to the DDA.  We will, of course, take a closer look at the social dimension of globalisation. Modern social systems and a better quality of life are not optional extras: they are an integral part of a formula to deliver a lasting political response to globalisation and it is this goal, above all, that remains at the heart of my mandate.
2492930 author: Lynne Green:  . Mr President, thank you for what has been a very constructive and helpful debate. I would like to thank those who have supported the Commission in its negotiating stance and its negotiating approach. It is never easy finally to judge precisely the best thing to do at the best time, but we do our best and I think it is true to say that amongst the key negotiating partners the EU has considerable support for the approach that we are taking. This is not as important as the support we have from our own side, from our own Member States and from the Members of this House.  I shall make one observation immediately. We have a number of interests in these negotiations  agricultural, 50 of the overall traderelated assistance funded worldwide. Commissionmanaged, traderelated assistance was around EUR 850 million a year in the period 20012004 and, on the basis of the pledge that President Barroso made at the last G 8 Summit, this will rise to EUR 1 billion in 2007 . We are actively engaged in the aidfortrade debate taking place in the WTO. The Commission is also a pioneer in carrying out trade sustainability impact assessments SIAs to assess the potential impact of trade liberalisation on all three pillars of sustainable development. Since 1999 nonagricultural, relating to services liberalisation and rules. Our job as negotiators is to get an outcome that is balanced across the range of those negotiating subjects. We will give in some places more than we will give in other places. There will be swings, there will be roundabouts, we will gain, and we will lose.  Nobody can make a final judgement about what Europe will be able to gain from these talks until the very end  not simply when the key modalities are put in place, as I hope they will be this summer, but when all the other negotiations have taken place on the individual country schedules and when all the negotiations about rules have also been put in place.  It is very important that those who are particularly concerned about agriculture in Europe understand and accept that we will not pay over the limits in agriculture for what we want elsewhere in the talks. We will do what is fair. We will do what is reasonable. We will do what is in our mandate as far as agriculture is concerned. That is clear to me. It should also be clear to our Member States.  Having said that, it is important to keep a sensible perspective in these negotiations. We must be careful not to devote such energy to protecting our defensive interests in agriculture in these negotiations that we fail to prioritise our offensive interests in nonagricultural market access and in services. There really must be a sense of proportion and balance as regards how we weigh the various economic and social interests that are at stake here.  As far as the United States is concerned, let me just say this in response to one speech: I do not feel that, should the talks fail, we as European negotiators are in a race with the United States to see who can shift the blame most effectively to the other. I look to the United States as a genuine partner, as a country and an economy that shares some of our interests but at the same time places a different emphasis from us in various areas of these negotiations. We will not reach a successful conclusion unless the EU and the US work together as a team  not at the expense of other negotiating partners, not instead of sensible negotiations and links and agreements that we will have with our negotiating partners in various areas of the negotiations.  However, if at the end of the day the EU and the US are at loggerheads and simply cannot agree the ground on which they will stand together to bring these talks to a successful conclusion, then there will be no successful conclusion to these talks. We will lose from that, the United States will lose from that, the global economy will lose from that and in particular developing countries will lose from that.  I should like to thank Members who have spoken, including those who have asked what my Plan B is if these talks fail. I am afraid I am not preparing for failure: I am going to continue to negotiate for success only, whether it be in relation to hormone beef, which is not part of these negotiations  we do not welcome US hormonetreated beef in the European Union for health reasons, not trade reasons  or in relation to GMOs, which again are not the subject of these talks and where our policy firstly has to be in line with the regulatory framework we adopted in the EU a few years ago and in line with WTO rules. It is this that governs our approach, rather than something I am negotiating in these talks.  I am glad that we  the Commission and Members of this Parliament  are able to cooperate in Geneva and elsewhere. I do not cooperate with this Parliament as an act of generosity on my part. There is nothing altruistic about this. The reason I cooperate is because I want the Members of the European Parliament there on these occasions. You give me valuable insights, you collect information and intelligence, you are able to tap different sources of opinion, which I do not always have easy access to, and you are also, on a good day, able to help us deliver a message to our negotiating partners. That is why I welcome Members of this Parliament being present and why I shall remain very firmly in cooperation with you.
3601161 author: Sebastian Merx:  , . Mr President, I should like to start by saying that this Commission and I, as Commissioner for Trade, are fully committed to working very closely with Parliament, in line with the framework agreement governing relations between the two institutions.  As this question rightly points out, the legal basis for this measure  Article  133  of the EC Treaty  does not provide specifically for consultation of the European Parliament on this proposal for an origin marking scheme. However, in line with our commitment to keep the European Parliament fully informed, on a par with the Council, of the conduct and conclusion of international negotiations, as well as legislative initiatives, the proposal and the accompanying impact assessment were transmitted on  12  January  2006  to the European Parliament via the Committee on International Trade.  I should like to refer to paragraph  2  of the motion for a resolution that you have before you. The language of that paragraph is slightly unfortunate because it could, as it is written at the moment, be read as if the Commission had not sent any document at all on origin marking to Parliament. As I said, we sent it as an Article  133  document to the INTA Committee. I believe that it would certainly be fairer to me and to the Commission  and more accurate  if an adjustment were made to the wording.  Our intention has been, and continues to be, to act in line with both the letter and the spirit of the framework agreement. To meet the commitment in that agreement, and in addition to the many formal and informal contacts that I have with you, the Commission tries hard to share a maximum of information with Parliament, just as I did last week in Geneva.  In particular we sent to the INTA Committee copies of all policy documents that are being discussed in the Councils  133  Committee. If a more formal interinstitutional way to bring this issue to your attention should have been used on that occasion, the opportunity was certainly not missed on purpose.  I very much welcome the interest you have already shown in this proposal through several questions on the subject, which we have answered. So let me now come to our proposal.  We have proposed a mandatory origin marking scheme, to create transparency about the origin of certain imported goods according to a single standard by which origin is determined. This system will allow consumers to take informed decisions; it will reduce the incidence of fraudulent or misleading origin marking. We believe it will help improve the image of European goods and will help our competitiveness. While it is clear that made in marking as such does not contain information on the social, labour or environmental conditions in the country of production, origin information helps the consumer to choose between different available alternatives according to their preferences and the background information they already have.  As regards WTO compatibility, the Commission believes its proposal is in line with international rules, notably Article  9  of the GATT. That provides that WTO members may adopt and enforce laws and regulations relating to marks of origin on imports, notably to protect consumers against fraudulent or misleading indications.  Concerning the enforcement of the proposal, the Commission considers that customs authorities are well placed to ensure that the requirements of the proposed scheme are respected, just as they do with many other rules on environmental, health and technical issues. That part of customs work is crucial to ensuring that our businesses can trade on a level playing field and that consumers draw the full benefits of globalisation.  I should add that in addition to possible controls carried out before the products are released into the internal market, the regulation provides for Member States to check origin marking on goods that are already on the market. That should enable Member States to draw on other expertise in policing the scheme, for example by working with those who are presently involved in the enforcement of national rules concerning the voluntary use of origin marking.  As you will be aware, Mr President, the Commission proposal is being debated in the Council and I am of course ready to keep you informed as discussions on the proposal move forward.
4264491 author: Alastair Smith:  . Mr President, this Parliament and the Commission are certainly joined in seeking a peaceful and democratic existence for the people of Somalia. That has been brought out in the debate this afternoon, following MrSmiths original introduction of this subject. I hope I shall be able to respond to paragraphs  6  and  8  in particular, concerning governance and institutionbuilding in Somalia and protection of humanitarian relief and humanitarian relief workers, as he asked me to do.  The discussion today on Somalia is timely, as the situation of the country and the region as a whole remains very fragile. The Commission is very much concerned about the risk of Somalia returning to war and to chaos.  Ever since the establishment of the Transitional Institutions in  2004 , the Commission has been spearheading the international communitys efforts to support the Somali Transitional Federal Institutions. My colleague, Mr Michel, follows the situation very closely and is in regular contact with President Yusuf and Prime Minister Ghedi of Somalia, as well as with leaders of the region.  I should like to focus my speech on three main aspects: firstly, the current state of play in the dialogue between the Transitional Federal Institutions and the Council of Islamic Courts; secondly, the regional dimension of the crisis in Somalia; and, thirdly, the extent of the Commissions support for the peace process as the most valuable way to promote respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.  Concerning the first  the current state of play in the dialogue between the institutions and the Islamic Courts  on  22  June the Transitional Federal Government and representatives of the Union of Islamic Courts met in Khartoum and reached an agreement of principle to engage in dialogue, to mutually recognise each other and to convene for further substantive talks on  15  July, again in Khartoum. This agreement was welcomed by High Representative Solana and by the Commission. The Commission takes the view that there is a window of opportunity for an interSomali political dialogue and it is crucial to engage the Islamic Courts with a view to reaching a political solution within the framework of the Transitional Federal Institutions.  Confronting the Islamic Courts is not the solution: it would not only radicalise the positions of all involved but also offer an opening to the extremists to further their agenda to create an Islamic state, to introduce Sharia Law and provide a safe haven for alQaida cells.  Secondly, the regional dimension of the crisis in Somalia is crucial. It is essential that all regional partners show unity of purpose and engage constructively in the Somali peace process. Destabilising interventions in Somali affairs by other countries in the region must be rejected and condemned.  We are committed to work closely and support the initiatives of IGAD, the African Union and the League of Arab States in finding a political solution to the crisis, as Mr Coveney was asking us to do. The Commission intends to anchor Somalia in a broader regional strategy for peace, security and development for the Horn of Africa. The outline of that strategy was presented by Commissioner Michel to the IGAD Heads of State last February.  Finally, the Commission is the main donor for Somalia, with an ongoing overall aid programme of EUR  300  million. We have supported the Somali National Reconciliation Conference and the establishment of the Transitional Federal Institutions and are now committed to further enhancing the functioning of the Transitional Institutions.  On  28  May  2006 , President Barroso and Commissioner Michel signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Transitional Federal Government. I can confirm that the Commission intends to make EUR  22  million available immediately to support the shortterm governance and capacitybuilding priorities set out by the Transitional Federal Government.  We remain unequivocally committed to supporting the peace process. The Commissions humanitarian arm, ECHO, is also providing direct relief assistance to the civilian population affected by the fighting, as well as by the consequences of drought. Everyone has a responsibility for ensuring the safe delivery of that humanitarian assistance and providing the safe custody and security of the humanitarian workers, all of whom are involved in this very valuable work.
876993 author: Christoph Bauer:  . Madam President, I apologise for being late. I flew out from Heathrow this morning. I have lost my luggage, so I have no clothes or makeup and look pale and ugly, but I hope that is alright! In London you have to take everything out of your bag.  MadamPresident, thank you for your contributions, and many thanks too on behalf of the Commissioner. We have already had a debate on this report and very much agree with the Commissions proposal. I have to say that my country, Denmark, does not support the Commissions proposal. I, for my part, do, however, even though I have amended it. I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for its considerable support. I should also like to thank you for your sound amendments and thank the large majority that has supported me.  I should like to discuss a number of points that I think it is important to emphasise before we vote tomorrow. Firstly, I should like to stress why this is a constructive proposal. It is constructive because it takes account of the environment. As is well known, the proposal is about abolishing registration taxes on passenger cars and instead introducing a new system involving an annual tax based on the cars emissions of pollutants. In the committee, we have gone a step further than in the Commissions original proposal, since the Commission only wanted an annual tax based on CO 2  emissions. However, CO 2  is not, of course, the only source of pollution. In my report I therefore recommend that the tax be based on all pollutants and particles detrimental to air quality. It is important to send a signal to the car industry to the effect that tax on cars depends on the level of pollution they cause. Hopefully, the proposal will therefore create an incentive for the car industry to produce cars that consume less petrol and cause less pollution.  The second important consideration  to which the Commissioner too attaches a lot of importance  is freedom of movement. At present there are  25  different tax systems with  25  different ways of calculating car taxes. Many systems are based on outmoded rules, and registration taxes can be an obstacle to freedom of movement. There is a risk of double taxation, and car owners often have to pay proportionately much more on their used cars when they transport them from one Member State to another. That is simply unacceptable.  It is also important from the committees point of view to emphasise that we want the proposal to be budgetneutral. It is very important that this change should not involve expenditure disadvantageous to the Member States  either in a transitional period or subsequently. Allow me to state, moreover, that the EU is not introducing a tax policy by means of this proposal. It is entirely up to the Member States themselves to decide how high the tax is to be and of what it is to be composed. I would therefore also call on the Council to vote in favour of this proposal, even though I know that it is on a sticky wicket in, for example, my own country and the United Kingdom. Consideration could of course be given to using the option offered by the Treaty of Nice of enhanced cooperation and allowing some Member States to go further than others.  Finally, there is a fourth important consideration, namely that there should be a long transitional period. It is important for the whole market, the industry, car owners and systems generally to be able to get themselves organised, and I therefore consider that a tenyear period is necessary for countries to be able to change their systems without incurring anything other than necessary costs. This will also ensure renewal of the stock of cars on the road.  These are, then, the four relevant points: a long transitional period, budget neutrality, freedom of movement and consideration for the environment. Finally, I just want to comment on the proposals from MrLangen on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I support these proposals, since I agree that there must be proportionality between the tax on cars and those cars emissions of pollutants. I also of course agree that we must protect veteran cars, and I therefore have nothing against veteran cars being exempt from the proposal. I do not myself own a veteran car, but I have every sympathy for owners of such vehicles.  I cannot recommend the amendments by the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance, since they are not in keeping with the overall thrust of the report, apart from anything else because an earlier entry into force would be unrealistic.  That was what I had to say. MrPresident, and not Madam President  I can see there has been a change of President  once again, excuse me for being so late. I hope that you will bear with me, and I look forward to a constructive vote tomorrow.
119612 author: James McNabb:  . Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very positive contributions to tonights discussion. A very wide and rich range of issues was raised, from transboundary pollution  fires in Russia, which should of course be raised in the framework of EURussia cooperation  to stricter criminal laws regarding arson and arsonists, which lie within the exclusive competence of the Member States.  The European Union mechanism for civil protection is a relatively new instrument with limited resources, limited means and competences, but recent experience shows that it works: it is a real example of European Union added value.  Having said this, when dealing with natural disasters there is no room for complacency and it is clear that our prevention, preparedness and response activities can still be improved. This is why earlier this year the Commission prepared a legislative proposal to reinforce the mechanism both politically and operationally. For example, the proposal will allow for the mobilisation of extra transport equipment and will provide a platform upon which to contribute to the development of early warning systems.  In April  2005 , the Commission also presented a proposal for a Council regulation establishing a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies. One part of this proposal provides the legal framework for the future financing of civil protection operations and will result in a budget of EUR 119  million over a sevenyear period. This is an improvement on previous levels of funding but, as I have mentioned many times before, the Commission can only respond to the ambitious requests made by other institutions if sufficient resources are made available. Mrs Estrela, we have an ancient proverb,     money is needed. Otherwise, we cannot deliver more!  Both these instruments are currently being negotiated by the Council. The Commission would like to have them adopted by the end of the year once Parliaments opinion is available. I would also like to offer specific thanks for Parliaments initiative to earmark an additional EUR  6 . 5 million in the civil protection budget for  2006 . This has allowed the Commission to launch an initiative to design, develop and test European approaches to joint civil protection intervention. This cooperation and coordination will make our fight against natural disasters  such as the floods in several European countries, or the summer forest fires in Spain, for which assistance was requested by the Spanish authorities on  9  August  even more effective.  On the specific question of forest fires, which was raised by a number of Members, it is necessary to note as I have before that forestry matters are a Member State competence. Member States are responsible for launching actions to protect forests threatened by fire, as well as restoration efforts. The main aim of the measures we take at European Union level is to reinforce the Member States policies.  These measures include the possibility of financial support available under the new Rural Development Regulation, the Forest Focus Regulation and, from  2007 , the Commissions proposal for LIFE Plus, which explicitly provides for the possibility of financing forest monitoring programmes and forest fire prevention activities in order to continue the work of the Forest Forum.  Let us look towards the future. The Commission is preparing a study to look at the effectiveness of Community measures for forest protection and at options to improve the effectiveness of these measures. The results of these analyses are expected by the end of  2007 .  The Commission has proposed a directive under the codecision procedure on the assessment and management of floods, which I hope will be adopted soon. The Commission has also undertaken preparatory work with regard to the threat of droughts, which become more intensive and frequent each year, particularly, but not only, in the southern parts of Europe. We are engaged in discussions with the Member States to collect information and to assess whether similar legislative action is needed.  Quite a few speakers referred to the Council regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund, which does not allow the Commission to mobilise the fund on its own initiative. It is necessary for the Member State concerned to make an application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage. To date, no such application has been received from the Spanish Government. The possibility of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund depends on whether the criteria in the regulation for mobilising the fund are met. The rules governing this instrument allow for the possibility of assistance in the event of major natural disasters. To qualify for aid, the estimated cost of total direct damage must exceed EUR  3 billion at  2002  prices, or  0 . 6  of gross national income of the state in question, whichever is lower. The Solidarity Fund is not designed to support general longerterm prevention measures for the rehabilitation of agricultural production potential. In such cases, other potential sources of funding exist at Community level, including projects cofinanced by the structural funds. In addition, several possibilities of response to national disaster exist within the common agricultural policy.  In  2006 , the Commissions civil protection mechanism responded to floods, earthquakes, forest fires, marine pollution and emergencies with a humanitarian dimension. Four European countries requested assistance in the spring floods, even though a greater number were eventually affected. We sent experts to all sorts of situations, from coordinating the European effort in Cyprus and Lebanon to assisting the Indonesian authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake and the eruption of a volcano. We sent emergency supplies such as medicines, medical supplies, food and shelter. We dispatched equipment to pump water and to extinguish fires. With your support we shall continue to better prepare ourselves and to improve our response for the benefit of the Member States and those we seek to help.
8459307 author: Lynne Bauer:  . Mr President, this has been a very useful debate because it has focused our attention, it has provided insight and it has given me guidance, which are the essential roles of Parliament visvis the Commission.  I am a new Commissioner and do not know what has happened in the past or what precedent has been set, but I feel instinctively that the informationsharing, consultation and dialogue I have with this Parliament and with the Committee on International Trade is very strong. It is certainly more wideranging and frequent and of greater depth than I was used to as a minister in my national parliament. I welcome the depth and strength of those contacts and am slightly surprised by the criticism that has been expressed. I do not know whether it is one representative of Parliament or of the Committee on International Trade as a whole, and I hope it is not.  The Commission consults Parliament on all main trade policy orientations on the basis of the Westerterp Procedure which, as we know, provides for the possibility of a debate in Parliament before the opening of negotiations on any trade agreement, as well as for information from the Council before the conclusion of any such agreement. We do so also on the basis of the Stuttgart Declaration, which states that Parliament should be consulted on the conclusion of all agreements  even ones covered by the then Article  113   that have an important bearing on the Community.  Our commitment to this relationship is shown by the fact that we send the Committee on International Trade copies of all the policy documents that are under discussion in the Councils Article  133  Committee. There is no legal obligation on us to do this. We do it because it is right and because it helps underpin our relations. No doubt we could do even better in the future, but to characterise what we do at the moment as poor or insufficient seems inaccurate.  A number of the points raised relate to legitimate concerns over the impact of these negotiations  both their direction and suspension  on developing countries. I should make it clear that developing countries do not conform to a standard size state of development or set of interests when it comes to the negotiations. There are different developing countries with very different interests and very different needs. Our job is primarily to ensure two things: firstly, that all developing countries benefit and gain from these negotiations and, secondly, that the weaker, more vulnerable and lessdeveloped among them receive the greatest direct assistance, not least in terms of capacitybuilding, Aid for Trade and the putting in place of a full dutyfree and quotafree system that enables them to access rich world markets.  In other words, we operate a system of proportionality: proportionality visvis what we expect developing countries to contribute and the effort we expect of them in bringing these negotiations to a conclusion, and proportionality also in terms of what we give and how we support and underpin their development. The countries that are in greatest need and have least to offer are quite rightly those which are, and will remain, our priority in these negotiations.  It is important to stress this because, unlike some of those who have spoken, I passionately believe that a good Doha deal can contribute to development and to fairer trade, through the way in which we operate special and differential treatment between developing countries, the way we allow carveouts for commitments to developing countries to protect and enable the development of infant industry, the way we provide for longer implementation periods for developing countries so that they can prepare for change and, in particular, the way that we grant special access to the leastdeveloped countries and attention to their capacity needs. We shall continue to adhere to that standard, as you would expect us to do, throughout the negotiations.  What is important is to have not just access for developing countries to the markets of the developed world, but also much greater access for developing countries to the markets of other developing countries. What is important is SouthSouth trade, especially given the extent of dutyfree and quotafree access that we in Europe already give to developing countries and particularly the ACP countries, as a result of which  75  of agricultural exports from Africa come to Europe, as do  45  of those from Latin America. In fact, we are the most open and fairminded trading bloc in the world. Let us remember that fact, whilst also reminding ourselves of what we can do better in the future. The greatest and earliest gains for developing countries will come from increased trade opportunities with other developing countries. It is therefore SouthSouth trade that we must not lose sight of when delicately and sensitively addressing the issues of tariff reductions and the muchneeded multilateralisation of Everything But Arms.  Others who have spoken have suggested that far from giving too little for and to developing countries, the European negotiating position has consisted of giving far too much, too early and showing far too much flexibility. Well, we in Europe conceived the Doha Round. We were primarily instrumental in launching it and we have nurtured it throughout. After Cancn we were instrumental in putting it back on track, through the framework agreement, in  2004 , and I do not apologise for putting an end date, in Hong Kong, on the elimination of our export subsidies. This was a commitment we had already made, assuming, of course, that we reach the end of these negotiations and that other countries act similarly in eliminating the components of their export subsidisation. I make no apology, and am not actually primarily responsible for the future of the common agricultural policy, although I would point out that I do not as yet see a consensus emerging in favour of its abolition.  In the event of a doubtful outcome to the Doha negotiations, we will have to look very carefully at what happens to the future of export subsidies, because that is linked to another point that has been raised in this debate  i.e. whether or not we will be more or less vulnerable to litigation at the WTO in cases brought against us on agriculture should a deal not be reached in the multilateral negotiations. If these negotiations do not succeed, I agree that it is likely that there will be an upsurge in cases brought to the WTO, especially concerning agriculture.  We in Europe can view this possibility with relative equanimity. We have reformed our common agricultural policy because it was right to do so for our own purposes and needs, as well as for the needs of others within the international trading system. To the extent that we have now implemented that reform, and will continue to do so, we are protected from litigation at the WTO. However, not all WTO members are in the same position and I certainly do not exclude the big agricultural exporters  for example Brazil and Argentina  trying the judicial road if they see that the political and negotiating one is blocked. However, others are more vulnerable to that than we are in Europe.  Before I make one final comment about timing, let me just say this about the WTO itself. Everybody  including the present DirectorGeneral of the WTO  agrees to varying degrees that the WTO would benefit from some institutional and procedural reform, as others have commented on during the course of this debate. The Sutherland Report provided some interesting ideas in this regard. However, we need to be clear in our minds on this. The present impasse in the negotiations is not due to an institutional problem but to a political one, and no institutional improvement could break the present deadlock. That is something which requires political will and an adjustment of attitude and policy on the part of certain WTO members.  That brings me to my last point, which relates to when these negotiations can restart. Quite simply, we will have to wait until the midterm elections in the United States are over in November before we can entertain the idea of a serious resumption in negotiations. I will be working to that end.
10311868 author: Sarah White:  . Mr President, Madam PresidentinOffice of the Council, Commissioner, having heard the presentation of the  2007  draft budget, we have an opportunity this afternoon to continue the discussions we had in Helsinki in July. Thank you for that invitation, Madam PresidentinOffice, which enabled us to establish contact as a small group, which then became a bigger one for the first reading of the draft budget in Brussels in July.  As the budget rapporteur for the House, I should like to make four comments on this particular occasion: one general comment and three specific comments.  The first, general, comment is that since this is the first year in the financial perspective we need to think of it in terms of being a strategic base, because in this particular year we will be setting in motion a number of ideas or ways of doing things that will reverberate over the next few years up to  2013 . As stated in particular in Parliaments resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy adopted earlier this year, we need in Europe as a whole to be able to adapt more quickly to the phenomenon of globalisation, which is changing the global economy and changing the orientation of our priorities to one of policy for results  as the President of the Commission has explained. I sense this is going to change the way in which we budget and finance what we do, and we may see the first signs of this in the  2007  budget.  Specifically, I would like to address the question of value for money, because this marks a departure from the norm, as I understand it from the Councils first reading, with many of the decisions on cutbacks in various areas not being done acrosstheboard but by taking into account the results of the activity statements produced by the Commission in particular sectors. As we shape our thinking on this we will refer back to what was set out with regard to the Annual Policy Strategy, which was that there are other elements that must be taken into account when looking at the absorption capacity of particular lines or the funds available for them.  The first of these elements is the document produced by the Commission, the budget forecast alert, which shows how expenditure is being implemented across particular budget lines for a particular year. Another of the costbenefit analyses we have launched in the Committee on Budgets is to look at particular areas where we think expenditure could be weak in quantitative or, in particular, qualitative terms.  Last but not least there are the Court of Auditors reports, of which we have many, on the way in which expenditure is used in particular budget areas. We are beginning to sense in the Committee on Budgets that we can bring together various elements that will indicate to us those lines where expenditure will be implemented correctly, and of which we can be sure, and perhaps also other lines of which we cannot be so sure. We certainly hope that by the end of the process, Madam PresidentinOffice, you will be able to align the Council with the declaration we adopted in July, at the time of the draft budget, calling for value for money to be considered in the European Union budget.  The second specific issue is the question of priorities. We are all aware that we have less money available under the financial perspective than we had sought in the final negotiations earlier this year, and that it therefore behoves us to look at the priorities across the different sectors. When it comes to the vote at first reading I suspect that Parliament will be following the priorities set out by Mr Bge, its rapporteur on the financial perspective. These have not changed greatly and are also set out in the resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy. That is what we are expecting for areas of research and innovation, into which we understand that the Council, in the form of the Member States, would like to invest more money, but of course there is never quite that much when it comes to the final budget.  Then there is the implementation of pilot projects and preparatory actions. In this field too we can think of areas in which we can spur action and in which longterm programmes could be run, in the form, perhaps, of exchanges of business and scientific personnel between the EU and China, or the EU and India. However, you cannot expect us at this stage to pick up on the ideas regarding administration. We rejected those when we discussed them at first reading in the Council, and it will take a great deal more discussion before we can come to any agreement on what to do as regards staff resources for the Commission.  The last point is that it is very strange that often in this House we can vote on a legislative programme, as we did on the one for  2006  last December, and yet no citizen in the European Union knows what the European Union will be legislating on, because you have the Commission proposal and you then have the parliamentary resolution. In the Committee on Budgets, as stated with regard to the annual policy strategy, we are looking to bring those two processes together and to have the budget decision and the legislative decision in December, followed by a clear statement from the Commission as to what the legislative programme for the Union is, so that everyone would know what it was  not just us in this House but people all over Europe.  In conclusion I would like to thank the PresidentinOffice for having come today to present the draft budget. There are a lot of discussions ahead of us, but we will seek a successful outcome for this budget that takes into account the European Parliaments priorities, as well as those of the Council.
3443200 author: Jennifer Merx:  . Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to this afternoons discussion. We see that they are very concerned about this global problem and how the European Union is responding to it.  Before I continue, I should like to assure Mrs Doyle that this discussion was not used as a cover by the Commission, for the simple reason that it was Parliament and not us who asked for this debate. So it cannot be a coverup. Also, concerning my failure to mention that Ireland submitted a National Allocation Plan, I have it in my papers. I said ten Member States and I thought I mentioned Ireland, but if you did not hear it, then you are right.  Looking further ahead, concerning the review, I am now preparing a highquality review of the European Union emissions trading scheme to identify improvements to be made beyond  2012 . This could not be done before because until  30  June  2006  we had not even received the actual emissions. The emissions were reported on  15 May  2006 , but some countries sent their actual emissions on  30  June  2006 . So how could we have the review before we received the actual emissions?  Later this year, following the adoption of the European Union emissions trading system review report in the coming weeks, the Commission will activate a stakeholder group under the auspices of the European Climate Change Programme to intensify the debate on the review. I firmly believe that we need to focus the review debate early in the process to ensure a highquality outcome. The priority issues to be tackled in the review are, therefore, the harmonisation and extension of the scope of the directive, further harmonisation and more predictability of the capsetting and allocation process  including consideration of competitiveness, more robust compliance and enforcement of the rules and the linking to trading schemes in third countries and increased involvement of developing countries.  The Commission has already confirmed its intention to address aviations climate change impact through emissions trading. There are a number of good ideas to make emissions trading more effective, including giving longerterm certainty on allocations and increasing harmonisation in a number of areas.  We need more time to discuss and further develop these valuable ideas. I am therefore aiming for the Commission to present a legislative proposal in the course of  2007 .  Here I should like to give a short answer regarding the concern expressed about power companies making windfall profits by pricing in the cost of allocations, although they receive them for free. Some companies have done that. The electricity price rose, not only because of the emissions trading system, but mainly because of high fuel prices and because of the lack of competition in the power and gas market  a lack of liberalisation. However, as one colleague mentioned, perhaps auctioning could be a solution, along with liberalisation, so we would avoid having windfall profits by power companies with consumers paying a higher price for electricity. According to the directive, auctioning is permitted for the second trading period, up to  10 . That is going to be one of the issues that will be discussed during the review period of the directive.  Looking back, we can say that the infrastructure for emissions trading is sound and the market in allowances is developing rather well. In the first year of operations,  2005   at least according to World Bank data   320 million allowances are reported to have been traded via market intermediaries, valued at more than EUR 6 million. So, no one can say that the emissions trading system has failed.  In  2006 , the monthly trading volume has increased steadily, with volumes of  80  to  100  allowances in a busy month. A number of organised exchanges across Europe are offering platforms for trading allowances and a number of other market intermediaries, such as brokers, are also active in the market.  I would like to say a few words about the socalled overallocation of allowances to installations that are covered by the emissions trading system. It is a fact that we had about  3  more allowances allocated than actual emissions. That could be for various reasons, one of which could be that companies installations reacted to the emissions saving system and the obligations arising from the system, and they have made the most obvious and easiest reductions in emissions by improving energy efficiency, for example, or through other easytotake measures. It was the case in Germany that we had a real reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide from installations. Another reason could be the very mild winter that we had in  2005 , which reduced the cost of heating, and  perhaps the main reason  the companies participating in the system were overoptimistic about their business growth and overestimated their emissions, while the Member States were complacent in accepting their figures.  But, during the second trading period, we have made it quite clear to all Member States that the  12  criteria of the directive should be kept, especially for those countries that did not contract to achieve their individual quota target, which will contribute to the overall target for the European Union. Also, the actual emissions that we have now should be taken into full account.  I am going to be tough but fair with Member States regarding the national allocation plans and am very glad for the support for this approach that has been obvious from your contributions today.  The onus is firstly on governments to propose plans to the Commission which ensure that the European Union emissions trading system delivers its contribution to achieving our quota targets. At the same time, all stakeholders should engage in the process of improving and expanding the European Union scheme, so as to secure a global carbon market that can deliver the emissions reductions necessary to tackle climate change.  I would like to thank you for the rich debate with encouraging and important contributions and for your continued support for the fight against global warming and the threat posed to future generations.
9279469 author: Amy Jones:  Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his words of welcome on this report.  Colleagues,  450  million people in our world live with a mental disorder. One in four of us will suffer from one during our lifetime;  58000  people in Europe commit suicide every year and ten times that number try to. More people die needlessly from suicide than from road accidents or Aids. Three in every hundred of us will have depression; one in three of us going to our family doctor will have a mental health problem, but only one in six of us will be diagnosed as such. That does not mean that two out of three of us will have good mental health: it means that we may not need, may not seek, or may not be offered treatment. It may mean that we are given inappropriate treatment with drugs, therapies, institutions and laws that at best may do no harm, and at worst may lead to physical and psychological damage. It almost certainly means that we are labelled, patronised, despised, feared and to a greater or lesser extent segregated in society, within our family, at work, at play and even within our health and social services.  In a perverse reversal, we can hide but we cannot run. We cannot perform, we cannot contribute to society as we would wish, we cannot lead full and fulfilling lives, as we would want. It also means that we have barely scratched the surface of creating a policy to promote mental wellbeing among our citizens from their early years, through the adult years of work and leisure and into old age and the years of increasing frailty.  That is why I welcome what has been achieved, firstly by a sequence of Council Presidencies  starting and culminating now with the Finnish Presidency  and by the Commission, where this Green Paper was drafted and will be driven through to active policymaking in the coming months.  When as a child I first came across mental illness, it was something you did not talk about. When I first came across mental health policy it had not progressed far from the locks, bolts, restraint garments, isolation rooms, powers to detain, forcible administration of drugs and so on  or so it seemed. In fact mental health policy has been on the move since the  1960 s, with more humane surroundings, treatments and therapies. Patients have been on the move too, going into community housing or back to their own homes. The public has not always liked that. No longer out of sight, out of mind, it became out of his or her mind and living next door to me and my children.  If modern, humane mental health policy is to work, it must have a spectrum of care and a range of health and social services, housing, training, transport and other services working in partnership. It must have trust between professionals, patients and families, and it needs our resources. To get those it needs political awareness, and that needs public consent and professional support. A service that does not gain professional, public and political support fails patients and their families doubly. It fails to treat and care adequately and it prompts a downward spiral of public confidence and so reinforces stigma.  Stigma is rampant in all our countries. It is a human rights abuse. It is unintentional, borne out of fear and ignorance, but just as damaging to the individual as any other form of abuse. We all contribute to the stigmatisation of people who, if they had a physical problem, would receive our sympathy and support. However, with mental illness we so often turn away and hope that someone else will cope. Living with mental illness is tough enough without adding to the burden of illness the pain of rejection and stigma. And so we must listen to patients and service users. They should be our partners and not just our patients. We have legislated against discrimination for people with disabilities. Perhaps we need to do so for people with mental health problems  both those in hospital and those in the community.  My report is about these things. It points the way forward to some of the changes we need. If the public believes, they will put pressure on governments, and those governments will then invest in good services. That makes public belief possible. We know that neuropsychiatric disorders are responsible for a third of disabilities,  15  of inpatient costs, a quarter of drugs costs, half the caseload of social workers and so forth. I want to be sure that if I, my wife or a member of my family has this problem in due course, as one of us is quite likely to, then I want a system in which they are hugged rather than rejected, loved rather than forgotten; a system in which it is not the case that they do not know people or do not know where they are; a system in which they are not within blank, cold, alien walls. I would want them to have hope and not selffulfilling despair. If we understand that it could be any of us  and it will be many of us  then we will seek a better service.  In my report I quote those words of Stefan Heym from Alexanderplatz in  1989  East Berlin:  (In these last weeks we have regained our power of speech and learnt once more to walk with our heads held high.)  The stigma of mental health is as repressive a regime as East Germany was. It stills our tongue, makes us hide our head and our task is to make sure that people with mental health disorders will, with our help, find their voices once again, their dignity, their selfrespect and walk once more with their heads held high.
6175184 author: Claire MacLeod:  . Mr President, Kosovo is indeed a part of Europe. It is not our back yard, but our front yard, and in the long term, a future EU territory. The European Union has a major responsibility for the future of Kosovo.  In our joint paper on the EUs future role in Kosovo, presented in July this year, Javier Solana and I made it clear that the EU will have to take the lead in international presence after the status process has been concluded. Our paper analysed the nature, size and responsibilities of a future international engagement; it also set out the EUs role after the status settlement and practical means to realise Kosovos future European perspective.  I fully agree with Minister Lehtomki and those MEPs who said that UNMIK will not be replaced by any kind of EUMIK, but rather a leaner, more streamlined international presence or international civilian mission.  The joint paper, which was endorsed by the Council, supports the work of President Martti Ahtisaari. Achieving a negotiated solution on the Kosovo status issue cannot be taken for granted. The United Nations Status Envoy needs our full support to put forward a comprehensive package that will allow the UN Security Council to decide on the way ahead. The key issue at stake is the protection of minorities, in particular of the Kosovo Serb minority.  The success of the status process will depend to a considerable degree on the ability and willingness of the EU to respond rapidly and concretely in support of an overall solution. The EU needs to give a clear signal that it will stay in Kosovo to play a key role in the implementation of the status settlement and to support its longterm EU perspective through the stabilisation and association process.  The powers of the future international presence in Kosovo should be limited to overseeing the implementation of the status settlement. All other powers currently exercised by UNMIK should, as a rule, be handed over to Kosovos authorities, so that they can govern with full responsibility and full accountability.  After the status settlement, our objective is to ensure that Kosovo becomes a reliable partner, progressing towards the EU together with the rest of the region. The EU will need to continue supporting Kosovos Government in setting up a modern, open, marketoriented and businessfriendly environment, based on EUcompatible structural reforms.  Finally, as members of the budgetary authority, you know that stabilising Kosovo will come at a cost. I fully agree with Minister Lehtomki that we will have to make appropriate provisions in the future to be able to cover this cost. The Commission is working with the World Bank and the local authorities to prepare a Kosovo Development Plan and Strategy for the medium term. After the status settlement, we will organise a donors conference to mobilise the international communitys support for the people of Kosovo.  Let us remember that it is better to cover the costs of economic and social development than to send more soldiers to the Balkans.  Dear friends, in that respect, the keys are in your hands, and in those of the Council. As Mr Poettering and other eminent MEPs are present here this morning, I would like to make an important point: the cuts to the Commissions staff budget proposed by the Council would make this task in Kosovo and the Western Balkans simply impossible.  The Councils plan would lead to the disappearance of  1700  posts at the Commission, starting with  170  posts in  2007 . Please do not ask the EU and the Commission to do more in ensuring external and internal security  be it in Kosovo, Lebanon or the Canary Islands. If our hands are tied we cannot do as you ask.  EU policy and aid does not come from heaven: it needs competent staff to carry it out. It also has a cost.  I have a special plea for the Finnish Presidency. The current United Nations Status Envoy comes from Finland, and I have special responsibility on behalf of the Commission concerning the Western Balkans and Kosovo. I hope the Council and the Presidency do not make our task of working for peace and stability in the Western Balkans and Kosovo impossible. I call on Parliament to correct this budgetary deadend. I also call on the Presidency to solve this dilemma soon, without unnecessary delay, using the famous Finnish common sense, and not stubbornness this time.
2168287 author: Nancy Finlayson:  . Madam President, of all the European countries, Albania has had the longest row to hoe in the transition from communist dictatorship to liberal democracy. It is a country that groaned under Stalinism well into the  1980 s, thus it must be clear to all of us that it faced far greater challenges than other postcommunist countries like my own, for whom the worst excesses of Stalinist totalitarianism ended in the  1950 s.  Albania has made enormous progress: the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is proof of it. At the same time, Albania should not rest on its laurels. To meet its European calling it needs to do more. The SAA is a milepost, it is not a destination.  I would sum up my report as follows. The SAA and the interim agreement offer a golden opportunity for Albania to modernise itself and become a competitive market economy, the sine qua non for joining the EU.  Secondly, genuine economic development requires a stable and transparent legal environment. This means a professional and independent judiciary, an effective and politically unbiased fight against corruption and an efficient, wellfunctioning public administration.  Thirdly, as with all transition countries, a sound legal framework is not enough. Good laws on the books help little if they are not enforced. Progress must be made in implementing the adopted reforms.  Fourthly, progress in achieving the standards laid down in the SAA, and therefore implementing the reforms, should be monitored by the EU by means of concrete benchmarks.  In addition to these general themes, I would like to underline a number of specific points in the report. While giving full support to Albanias European perspective in line with the Thessaloniki conclusions, the report underlines that Albania needs to pursue the fulfilment of European values and standards as a goal in itself. It calls for a visa facilitation agreement with Albania. Today, citizens of a small country with a European perspective have a less favourable visa regime with the EU than a large country with no membership prospects  Russia.  The report calls on the EU and Albania to take advantage of the knowledge and experience of the  2004  accession states. The challenges faced by Albania are not unique; there is no need to reinvent the wheel when the expertise of the wheelwrights of reform from eight postcommunist EU Member States is freely available.  The report notes that a recent Amnesty International report was critical of Albania for violations of human rights in areas of access to legal defence, the problems of torture and brutality towards prisoners, and so on. These deficiencies must be corrected.  The report says that electoral legislation must be reformed. This means a more reliable voters registry and changes in the system to avoid distortion of the proportionality system  this system is currently known as the Dushk system in Albania  because, let us be honest, faith and democracy will not last if the voters will is distorted. I think this is one of the crucial democracy issues that the country faces today.  The report underlines the need for Albania to continue with its responsible attitude towards neighbouring countries, particularly towards Kosovo and FYROM. As we know, there are substantial Albanian minorities in FYROM, and Kosovo, of course, is an Albanian area. We welcome the attitude taken thus far by Albania in not getting involved in those problems.  I have received six amendments. I will take on board Amendment  5  from Mr Brie and Mr Meijer on the need to address the issue of trafficking of children. Amendments  1  and  2  are good in principle, but in the opinion of the rapporteur will be more appropriate when Albania has made far more progress in dealing with its fundamental problems involving corruption, the rule of law and economic reforms. In my opinion, Amendment  3  on the treatment of prisoners is already covered in the report.  To conclude, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this report, but I would especially like to single out Mrs Pack, the dynamo driving so much of this Houses approach to bringing the Balkans into Europe.
1979387 author: Nancy Green:  . Mr President, the conflict in Lebanon, the violence in the Palestinian Territories, the suffering of civilians in northern Israel: these past months the prospect of a comprehensive peace has seemed further off than ever, and yet, paradoxically, these conflicts  especially the misery suffered by ordinary Lebanese, ordinary Israelis and ordinary Palestinians  have once more highlighted the need for a negotiated regional solution. They are a stark and cruel reminder that security and stability cannot be imposed unilaterally without dialogue or diplomacy. This is a moment of distress and suffering in the Middle East, but I believe it is also one of opportunity, and we have to seize that opportunity.  It is specifically by mobilising the very considerable resources of the European Union, from the political and security to the technical, economic and financial, and by deploying them in close cooperation with the rest of the international community, that we may be able to put the peace process back on its feet.  As the PresidentinOffice said, the European Union is playing an unprecedented role. Europe is fully engaged with Lebanon and determined to play a strong role in supporting the implementation of Security Council Resolution  1701  and in finding lasting peace for the region. EU Member States are making a decisive contribution to the expanded UNIFIL peacekeeping force in support of the rapid extension of the Lebanese Governments authority throughout Lebanon. The European Union is at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to remove the continuing air and sea blockades of Lebanon.  From the outset of the conflict, the European Commission has been very active on the ground, supporting our partners and their people when they most needed us. Over the past six weeks, the Commission has mobilised and coordinated a very important European response to the urgent needs caused by the conflict. From the second week of the conflict onwards, we provided rapid humanitarian assistance. I was glad and grateful to learn that Parliament had agreed to our request to mobilise further resources from the emergency reserve. This will allow ECHO to continue its action in support of essential early recovery, notably for water, sanitation and housing, thus bringing our total humanitarian support to over EUR  50  million.  The Commission also helped to coordinate and support evacuation efforts, providing EUR  11  million in support of the evacuation of thirdcountry nationals caught up in the conflict, in response to a request from the Foreign Minister of Cyprus to provide urgent assistance to help launch this operation quickly.  On the ground, the Commission also played an important role in assessing the situation and setting up the first coordination exercise among donors. We are already working with the Lebanese Government, as well as with the United Nations and the World Bank, to ensure that in this postconflict phase this coordination will be led and informed by the Lebanese themselves  it is a question of ownership.  The Commission has also responded to the environmental disaster and has supported the Lebanese Government through the Community Civil Protection Mechanism in order to tackle the huge environmental damage. Now we are working to assess and to address the needs relating to the reconstruction of Lebanon with a view to restoring its infrastructure, and promoting economic recovery, social development and political cohesion.  Last week at the Stockholm Conference, I announced a package of EUR  42  million to support early recovery until the end of the year. This brings the Commissions contribution so far to just over EUR  100  million. I believe the European Commission has shown that it is ready to act and to act quickly.  The European Unions contribution to meeting specific and immediate needs is crucial in order to support the implementation of Security Council Resolution  1701  and to support a lasting settlement to the conflict between Israel and Hizbollah that has for too long destabilised Lebanon and also threatened Israel. The Middle East needs a strong, sovereign, unified and politically independent Lebanon, able to consolidate the fragile peace that has returned and to contain the very real risk of spillover of tension that remains.  The Lebanese population must also feel the tangible benefits of the cessation of hostilities. A Beirutdriven reconstruction process will help to strengthen the role of the Lebanese Government. For this, and in order to really start the reconstruction phase, the lifting of Israels air and sea blockade is crucial. I join again with SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan in calling for its immediate removal.  Over the longer term, the international community must remain engaged, with a focus on supporting institutional recovery and promoting Lebanese statebuilding efforts, including those undertaken via the national dialogue. That means pursuing the political, social and economic agenda already outlined in the EU Lebanon Action Plan. It is not an exaggeration to say that the measures we identified together before the conflict are now more important than ever.  We must also work collectively with our Lebanese counterparts to ensure that conditions for longterm stability are met, including removing the ambiguity surrounding the disarming of Hizbollah  which can only realistically be achieved as part of a process of political integration  and clarifying the status of the Shebaa farms.  We must not lose sight of the broader picture across the region. While international attention was drawn to Lebanon, the violence and suffering continued in the Palestinian territories and Qassam rockets continued to fall on Israeli towns and villages. I was in Israel with the Finnish President after the Rome Conference. We went to Haifa, where there was constant danger from rockets.  In the Palestinian territories, in order to avoid further escalation we need a return by the Palestinian militants to the calm that held for most of  2005 , the release of hostages, detainees and prisoners, as well as progress on basic issues of movement and access, which, as we know hold the key to Palestinian economic recovery and to the creation of a viable Palestinian State. This should start with the rapid reopening of the Gaza crossings, in particular the Rafah border, supported by the EU border assistance mission. The Commission is, in principle, ready to take further action to upgrade the infrastructure and strengthen capacity on the basis of the access and movement agreement of last November.  The context must be our longstanding aim of building up the institutions of a future Palestinian State, working with the Palestinian Authority, which in turn means that the EU should be ready to respond pragmatically to the formation of a Palestinian national unity government. I repeat that we will engage with any government ready to work for peace through peaceful means.  We must not and we do not forget the plight of the Palestinian people. We have, as you know, via the temporary international mechanism, ensured access to clean water and sanitation in the Gaza Strip. We kept hospitals and healthcare centres going through the summer and we have now also provided social allowance payments that have benefited more than  600000  Palestinians directly and many more indirectly. But with the continued political stalemate, closures and also frozen fiscal revenues, the TIM can only provide temporary relief. We cannot go on much longer like this. We must seek ways to improve access and movement to get Israel to unblock the withheld Palestinian revenues that now amount to EUR  500  million and to get the Palestinian Authority to ensure public order and security. We owe it to the parties and they owe it to their own people.  The rapid escalation of violence this summer produced no victory, only victims. We see once more the failure of military action to resolve the long drawnout conflicts of the Middle East.  Yet the status quo  which includes the slow chipping away of the credibility of a twostate solution, continued occupation and endemic violence  is itself a recipe for instability. It is also a recipe for interference by third parties and radicalism, fuelled by injustices, either perceived or real.  There is, then, really only one choice: we need to renew the political perspective upon which the peace process depends, including for example our position on the primacy of the  1967  borders. We must do everything possible to bring all the parties back to the negotiating table. By focusing on some concrete and pragmatic measures that can bring about some positive and tangible results, we can help to create the appropriate climate and facilitate a reengagement between the parties.  Decisive action is needed to get the parties back on track towards a negotiated peace. I have called for an early meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert. I hope they can address the issue of hostages and detainees, as well as other pressing questions of violence, access and finances.  It is time for Israel and Lebanon to establish channels for dialogue, and for Syria to be brought back into the equation, as they show readiness to play their part in the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Iran must also take its responsibility and demonstrate its readiness to contribute to peace and stability in the region.  Many ideas have been floated on a comprehensive approach to peace in the Middle East. The Arab League initiative in particular deserves our full attention. At the Gymnich meeting last weekend, many voices called for greater EU leadership in the Middle East. I believe they are right. We have to turn the tragic events of this summer into an opportunity for a longterm settlement of the still open conflicts in the region. Our credibility, and that of the Quartet and the UN, is at stake.
120797 author: Claire Whittacker:  Mr President, this summers conflict has claimed the lives of over  1000  people, the vast majority of whom were innocent civilians. It has reduced much of Lebanon to rubble. If the situation teaches us nothing else, it must teach us to look forward, rather than back.  We should waste no time in deploying the  7000  troops that the Union has pledged to UNIFIL to stabilise the situation in southern Lebanon, to cut off the flow of arms and to support the humanitarian effort. We must, however, clarify UNIFILs mandate to turn the UN resolutions into reality on the ground.  And of course we must go further. We must speak with one voice. We must, in the short term, demand the immediate lifting of Israels air and sea blockade of Lebanon. We must demand the lifting of the blockade of Gaza and we must help to establish an effective Palestinian Government.  In the medium term, while condemning terrorist acts we must bring Hizbollah and Hamas in from the cold and engage them in a dialogue for the establishment of a democratic framework. We must set up an independent inquiry into the civilian deaths caused by all sides in the recent conflict and, as Kofi Annan has pointed out, it will not be through the barrel of a gun, but thanks to dialogue and compromise that Hizbollah will put down their weapons and negotiate a longterm solution.  We have longterm tasks too. If we are to raise a new generation that is not steeped in fear and intolerance, we must build institutions that will ensure peace in the long term. When he was President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi talked about setting up a EuroArab development bank, jointly financed and managed by both sides. We must look, too, at a security organisation along the lines of Mr Fogh Rasmussens proposed conference on security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, which Mr Schulz has quoted. We must look at how we can tie in, with a proper immigration policy, all of the countries of the Mediterranean basin. And we must oversee all of this through the EuroMediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in which you, MrPresident, have invested so much political  and no little financial  capital. Let us learn from Einstein when he told us that peace cannot be kept by force, only achieved through understanding.  Mr Tuomioja, you spoke about the European Unions remarkable achievement and its major success. I commend the work you have done, but let us not exaggerate. It is a crisis that has driven the European Union to the position it is in, though something Michel Barnier has called the . The Union does not have the European constitution that it needs and which would have equipped it far better to deal with this situation. We are deploying European forces but this is not an EU force, even if  thank heavens  it is a coalition of the coherent.  In terms of democratic decisionmaking we are running on a wing and a prayer. After your meeting in Lappeenranta on  25  August, Mr Solana said that this was the most important decision taken by the EU for many years. If that is so, then why is MrSolana not here, telling us about it and telling us about the conditions surrounding this conflict? He has a mandate, but of what kind?  When we asked we were told that the rules of engagement for the forces were: a matter strictly between the United Nations and the troop contributors. We were told, therefore, that this was not a European matter. It is absurd that Mr Solana is not here to talk to us about the rules of engagement for this conflict!  The danger is this: the European public at large believe that Europe has responded to the crisis. If things go wrong and we have large numbers of young men coming back home in body bags, people will want to know who in Europe is responsible. Somebody will have to take the political responsibility.  Please, PresidentinOffice of the Council, get Europes common foreign and security policy together so that we are not faced with that kind of situation.  In conclusion, we should give two cheers for Europe: one for Louis Michels rapid action and one for Romano Prodis courage in coordinating our efforts to deal with this problem. We should thank the Commission, the Finnish Presidency and Cyprus  a new Member State  for the tremendous help it has given. We should also thank Turkey for having the courage to help us in committing troops.  However, we still run the risk of insistence on national sovereignty resulting in global anarchy.
3028467 author: Christoph MacLeod:  . Mr President, let me begin by welcoming this debate. I thank the honourable Members and the rapporteur in particular.  Let me make a few strategic remarks at the outset. As you will be aware, the ninth EUChina Summit will take place in Helsinki in just three days time. It will be a very important opportunity to discuss current issues and concerns at the highest level. However, I should also like to focus my contribution today  particularly in the light of the focus of your report  on how we can bring a more strategic approach to our relations. I may then add a few words on some specific items.  Our relationship with China is one of the key issues facing the European Union today and one that is constantly on my mind. This is true across the board, whether on environment and climate change, energy security, nonproliferation, global and regional security, economic and trade relations and specific issues such as illegal migration. There are also all the issues relating to the rule of law that you have mentioned.  We all know the key challenges. Firstly, Chinas economic growth has been phenomenal, but, at the same time, it is still a developing country and more fragile than we might think. To be sustainable, economic growth must be accompanied by social and political reform. Secondly, China has a vital role to play in creating more stable international energy markets and dealing with environmental challenges. Thirdly, accelerating globalisation  which is increasingly identified in the public mind with cheap production in China  is an issue and is leading to pressure for protectionism in developed markets, which both the European Union and China need to work to avoid. Fourthly, China, like the European Union, wields global influence. Will this support or hinder a rulesbased multilateral world order? Put simply, the question facing us is how we should respond to the rising superpower with whom we certainly share interests and common ground, but  and let us be realistic here  with whom we also disagree as regards some very fundamental values and beliefs.  Before suggesting some principles that should guide our strategic response to this challenge, I should reiterate that the basic premise for the EUs policy towards China must be one of engagement and partnership. There is no suggestion of containment or of hedging our options. Engagement and partnership are the most effective basis for encouraging and supporting Chinas development in a way that meets the aims and interests of both the EU and China.  What principles should guide us? In terms of Chinas internal reform and development we must be constructive and we must complement Chinese policy where possible. However, the European Union must also send firm and very consistent messages on our areas of interest, such as the need for social and political reform to ensure Chinas sustainability, the importance of international nonproliferation regimes, and immediate market access and a level playing field for EU companies. Secondly, internationally, the European Union has an interest in encouraging more active and responsible international engagement by China. We need to enhance our understanding of Chinese foreign policy if we want to work together effectively. We should emphasise the regional component, increasing our awareness and sensitivity as regards regional issues and encouraging regional integration and greater multilateralism in Asia.  Thirdly, the European Union needs greater focus and coherence internally. Before exploring new areas, there should be a full internal review of our existing cooperation, leading to a clearer focus on priorities and, as necessary, moving on from areas which are ineffective or are no longer priorities. Our aim should be a holistic approach, with the European Union as a whole speaking again with one voice on its China policy.  Fourthly, we should also work to ensure that our bilateral relations are strengthened by embracing all constituents of societies. Parliament will also have a very important role to play in this context. We need a longterm programme to promote mutual understanding and an effective strategic policy mechanism that is sufficiently informal and flexible.  Fifthly, throughout this process, the European Union should be aware of its strengths. There is particular EU expertise on a range of issues relating to internal stability where China wants help, for instance on energy, the environment, regional integration and public health, and we should exploit this as fully as possible.  Sixthly, there are other areas in which we have less leverage. I know the human rights situation in China is of particular concern to Parliament, as it is to the Commission. The past year has not been seen as a year of significant progress on any of the areas in which we are particularly interested, such as the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the release of the  1989  prisoners, the abolition of reform through labour and greater protection for freedom of expression and of religion, where we continue to have real concerns. But I can assure you, honourable Members, that these issues will remain a central part of our policy agenda and we will continue to engage and to push for progress.  The Commission is taking steps to turn these principles into reality. We will, as the report requests, set out a new strategic vision for our policy towards China, which we will be in a position to present formally to the Council and Parliament in November. I look forward to assessing the situation for myself during my trip to China early next month.  In addition to our continued support for Chinas internal reform process, I think we should also focus on four basic priorities: first, we need a greater balance in our bilateral relations, whether described as reciprocity, equality or mutual benefit. That includes a more meaningful dialogue on human rights and related issues. Questions such as progress on social and economic rights would be included there. We are worried by the situation on civil and political rights in China, and in particular, as has been mentioned, as regards freedom of expression, religion and association and the protection of the rights of minorities. We are, in that context, concerned that internet use is being more and more restricted and controlled. As I heard the rapporteur say, we attach great importance to the issue of organ harvesting. It is clear that the legislation on that issue recently adopted by the Chinese Government does not adequately address the issue of donor consent, particularly for those who have died in custody or who have been executed. We have made our concerns known very clearly to the Chinese Government, both through our human rights dialogue and wider political channels, urging it, in quite strong terms, to take measures to address these concerns as a matter of urgency.  We need to make China a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder, it needs to be a positive and active contributor. On trade issues, if EU markets are to remain open, we have to see to it that we need a genuine, bilateral and multilateral response from China implementing the letter and spirit of the WTO commitments. We need to overhaul the management structures for our relationship to avoid fragmentation and to ensure our allocation of resources on China is appropriate.  There is much to be done in defining a realistic but also an ambitious strategic vision for moving EUChina relations forward. We should not ignore the difficulties involved in achieving this  and I do not think we are ignoring them. But let me reiterate that it is crucially important that we get the relations right. Both sides want a genuine strategic partnership that merits its name. It is our responsibility to translate this political desire into practice.  I think we have a good basis on which to move forward and, as we do so, I hope we can count on your support, because it is too important an issue for us not to succeed.
691817 author: Jennifer Jones:  . Mr President, this debate was very timely and it has provided me with food for thought for the EUChina summit in Helsinki. I should like to add that the vast majority of subjects raised tonight will also feature clearly on the summit agenda and I will report back to you on that.  Let me make a general point on the relationship between trade and human rights, which is a central theme of this report. I am not sure whether specific linkages are desirable or feasible, but I would argue that this is an inevitable connection, insofar as Chinas opening is strongly predicated on its WTO accession, which, apart from frequently raised important issues like intellectual property rights, involves also an overhaul of the Chinese legal system, with an emphasis on the rule of law. It must be said that real progress has been made. That is fundamental in moving forward in of the human rights questions raised today and it is even happening almost by stealth.  Let me come back to some specific points that have been raised tonight. Firstly, on Tibet, we share the concerns expressed by the European Parliament regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and in particular the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. We have regularly addressed the issue of Tibet in the framework of the EUChina bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, including summits. As part of this overall policy visvis Tibet, for many years we have been asking for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, as that is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question. We have therefore taken note of the talks between the envoys of the Dalai Lama and the representatives of China.  Let me also say a word on Taiwan. We have been consistent throughout in urging the two sides to resolve their issues through a peaceful dialogue. In this regard we have also noted some recent positive developments in the crossstrait situation. We have to recognise that there are new Chinese efforts to restart discussions with Chinese and Taiwanese opposition politicians. Flights across the Straits have resumed, but an inclusive dialogue with all parties in Taiwan is also needed. This is important.  Let me also make a point concerning our bilateral relationship and the relationship with the United States of America. As Mr Lambsdorff said, it is important to talk about China to the US about common concerns, for example on open markets and human rights, because we can achieve more together visvis China. However, it is also clear that a strategic dialogue with the US, which we have at official level, does not mean that we have to agree right across the board.  On the longstanding issue of the arms embargo, it is true that we are willing to continue working towards a possible lifting of the embargo, on the basis of our joint statement of  2004 , the EUChina Summit and the subsequent European Council conclusions. However, at the same time, we have left China with no doubt as to the importance of progress on human rights in order to create a more positive atmosphere for lifting the embargo. We have also made clear our commitment to ensure that lifting the embargo would not lead to any substantive change in the strategic balance in the Asian region and that the national security of friendly and allied countries would be fully taken into account. So, again, this is one of those issues that is very important.  On the very specific and important issue of shoes, let me say that on  30 August  2006  the Commission adopted a proposal to impose antidumping duties on certain leather shoes from China and Vietnam. Reflecting the finding that dumping exists and EU producers are suffering harm, we have proposed a duty of  16 . 5  for China and  10  for Vietnam for certain leather shoes. This proposal now passes to the Member States, which have one month in which to consider it for adoption. That is the situation at present.  On the sectoral dialogues, my services produce regular updates and these are on our websites. A further update will be available shortly.  I should like to close with two general statements. Again, as I said at the start, we are committed to human rights, social and economic rights, which include in particular freedom of expression, religion, association and protection of the rights of minorities. I should also like to say that the death penalty is one of those questions continually being addressed. I should also like to reemphasise what I said before about the Falun Gong.  Finally, in response to Mr Brok, and as I said at the beginning, we need China to become a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder: it needs to be a positive and an active contributing partner. It is a very important member of the international community, being a permanent member of the Security Council. All of that will feature prominently in our communication, which will be available in the autumn.
1826062 author: Amy McNabb:  . Mr President, firstly I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur Mrs Fraga Estvez and the Committee on Fisheries and to Mrs Ries and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for a constructive report on a Community approach to ecolabelling for fisheries products. I am pleased at the high degree of interest they have shown in the Commissions communication. In fact, the report is a fitting and valuable contribution to the debate on ecolabelling. It contains many elements and ideas that are helpful to strengthen further the debate.  The Commission indeed attaches great importance to the development of a consistent policy on ecolabelling and to a consistent integration of environmental concerns into the Common Fisheries Policy. Together with other actions proposed by the Commission, such as the implementation of sustainability which leads to sustainable yields, or the promotion of more environmentfriendly fishing methods, I see ecolabelling as a complementary tool for a more environmentfriendly fisheries policy. At the same time it satisfies the interests of both consumers and the industry.  I would like to thank Mr Morillon for his description of ecolabelling as a positive sanction supporting sustainable behaviour. Ecolabelling is a relatively new approach in the context of sustainable fisheries management. It is based on a voluntary and participative approach, through which fishermen will in future, within the limits of the standards set by legislation, define requirements and implement them. Such a voluntary approach has been adopted in other fields, particularly in that of food safety with the enforcing of the HACCP system, and has proved highly successful. I thank you for lending your support to that approach.  I am happy to see that the Commission and Parliament share the same views on the overall objectives of ecolabelling schemes, on the principles and features that credible schemes should contain, and on the need to address properly a complex and currently rather anarchic reality. Traceability, transparency, a sound scientific basis, and thirdparty certification are essential. I see these as the prerequisites that will help us make the most of ecolabelling schemes and that will contribute to the sustainability of fisheries.  In the Commission we opted for launching a debate on the right approach rather than proposing operational provisions at too early a stage. I understand that many of you feel that the Commission should have been more assertive. However, I am convinced that it was wise to proceed as we did.  Due to the originality of the approach, the ambitious objective we have and the controversy that issues like these invariably raise, it would have been premature to bring forward an operational proposal as early as June last year. I assure you that our choice to launch a debate first has proven to be successful. It has facilitated and accelerated the exchange of views and relevant experience between all sides concerned. As a result we now have a sound and almost complete picture of the situation, on which we can base further Community action.  The active participation of the Community in the FAO debate has given us an early advantage, and by launching the debate and participating in fruitful exchanges of views we have strengthened our leading position in this matter.  The definition of the notion of sustainability is at the heart of the debate. Many of the parties involved have inquired about relevant criteria. To follow up on this, DG Fisheries has set up a group of independent experts to work on that very issue. The expert group is on the point of concluding its work. Based on that work the Commission will draft guidelines for the settingup of ecolabelling schemes and will propose a list of minimum requirements against which private ecolabelling schemes could be assessed.  I have taken note of the resolutions request for a communication to be addressed to the Council and to Parliament within the next six months. I have no difficulty in reverting to Parliament. However, at this point in time, the shape and form of the Commissions proposals have still to be determined.  Looking at the broader picture, I believe it would be more appropriate to come back to Parliament once the whole consultation exercise has been concluded. That would allow us to carry out a thorough assessment of the following discussions and consultations: a second shareholder consultation, to be held before the end of this year, which would be an opportunity to gather views on the future guidelines; further discussions in the Council in the months to come, which will conclude the current discussion phase; and, additionally, the report from the expert group, which will form the basis for the preparation of operational provisions that could be tabled during the course of next year.  All this will give us a further opportunity to discuss the future Community approach towards ecolabelling on a consolidated and even more informed basis. That whole process should lead to the adoption of specific and concrete decisions.  With regard to Amendments  1  and  2 , the Commission believes that ecolabelling is a tool that will contribute to a more sustainable exploitation of fish stocks and improve the effectiveness of the Common Fisheries Policy.  With regard to Amendment  3 , it reiterates some of the advantages of adopting the third option for establishing minimum requirements for voluntary ecolabelling schemes, as mentioned in the Commission communication.  I thank you for this report and the wider debate generated on ecolabelling. I am confident that at the end of this process we can put into operation a proper basis for ecolabelling schemes that should have farreaching and positive effects.
1964451 author: Christoph Green:  . Mr President, we all know that Europes citizens are on the move. We have overtly encouraged this within our own borders through the principle of free movement. However, our citizens are also mobile throughout the world and they can end up in all sorts of improbable situations and scrapes that involve them dealing with civil law in the courts. Such is the nature of modern life. So far as it is feasible we want to be able to offer them some sort of certainty at these moments of personal crisis.  For more than  100  years, The Hague Conference on Private International Law has worked tirelessly and with an evergrowing number of countries across the globe to put together numerous international conventions on civil law subjects: sale of goods, testamentary dispositions, child abduction, maintenance obligations and roadtraffic accidents. They have striven to provide a coherent legal framework in an increasingly mobile world.  When I was a practising lawyer, I often had recourse to Hague conventions to assist clients caught up in troubles with a crossborder dimension. Those clients had reasons to be thankful for the existence of this rather unknown organisation. Over the last years as a parliamentarian, I have had the privilege, on behalf of this House, to attend many of The Hague meetings, to get to know the people behind this apparently rather technical and distant exercise, to see the officials and national experts at their work, drafting and negotiating very complex and technical agreements to assist our citizens. It is difficult work, taking account of an everincreasing number of legal traditions and cultural values. Whilst it may seem to be technical work, there are very big political choices underlying many of these apparently dry legal issues. This work should increasingly see the light of day and I hope that our involvement will assist that process.  Up until now, the Community has been represented by all its individual Member States and, from my limited observations, that also brings a richness and strength to the work of the conference because of the diversity of our own legal traditions and our own comparative legal experience. However, it is also clear that, given the new Community competence postAmsterdam, there is every reason why the Community should operate as a Community within the conference. In every practical sense it already does this through joint coordination meetings and, in any event, the conference works by consensus. Therefore, I have absolutely no problem in recommending to colleagues that this House should give its assent to the accession of the Community to The Hague Conference. It is a good thing, a positive and timely development.  However, there is a caveat; it is contained at the end of the explanatory statement to my report and set out in more detail in our chairmans motion for a resolution. In passing this competence to the Community, Parliament is in some measure possibly detracting from its own hardwon legislative powers. I say possibly detracting, because tonight we look to the Commissioner for reassurance that Parliament will continue to be fully involved in the future work when new conventions are negotiated and new or old ones ratified by the Community. We have to find new working methods that fully respect Parliaments position as colegislator with the Council.  Much as I have enjoyed over the last years attending Hague Conference meetings as a sort of ad hoc representative of this House, we now need something much more formal and transparent that reflects the new role of our institutions in this process.  I hinted earlier that the conventions negotiated at The Hague deserve much more attention. They deserve that attention because they not only achieve positive outcomes for our citizens but also, increasingly, involve making political choices and balancing interests. This is work that cries out for more parliamentary involvement and I know that this is something The Hague Conference would also welcome. There have been initial discussions about some kind of parliamentary forum. This is something we should pursue.  However, this should not be seen as in any way excusing the need for this House to be fully involved in the Communitys legislative process in relation to the work of the Conference. This would be by way of an additional activity that is within our powers to undertake. I hope colleagues will agree that we should be initiators in this regard, perhaps hosting a first meeting.
9222445 author: Jennifer Whittacker:  . Mr President, today we are discussing the PNR Agreement with the United States. However, we are all fully aware of the fact that this issue can only be debated in a wider context, particularly in the light of the information received last night to the effect that President Bush has finally admitted that secret CIA detention camps actually exist. We should look at this issue in the wider context of the methods used to combat terrorism  the methods that we in Europe want to use in the fight against terrorism and the methods that are used by our friend and ally, the United States.  The case of the CIA detention camps and rendition flights and the case of the PNR Agreement demonstrate very clearly the urgent need for Europe to speak with a single voice. We urgently need a single European policy in this area. I welcome what Commissioner Frattini has said, because in my view a common EU policy is not one designed by a handful of ministers that meet behind closed doors, in informal meetings. An EU policy is one made following a proper democratic procedure that involves Parliamentary scrutiny, i.e. in codecision with Parliament. You therefore have my wholehearted support for the proposal on the bridging clause. I hope that the governments too will now realise how urgent that is.  With regard to the PNR issue itself, we should distinguish three phases. One is the shortterm renegotiation of the current agreement, which is very urgent and needs to be concluded by the end of the month. I have heard rumours which seem to indicate that the US is in no great hurry to conclude the Agreement and might actually ultimately prefer bilateral agreements. It is therefore very important that all European countries and the EU institutions close ranks and adopt a united stance.  I very much welcome the much more forthcoming attitude adopted by the Council and Commission this week. That is the best way forward. Were there to be no agreement it would be absolutely catastrophic for the European Union and for the protection of our citizens personal data.  With regard to this agreement, we all seem to agree that the substance of the agreement should preferably be left untouched. We would have preferred to improve the agreement, but the US would like to move in another direction. I therefore feel that the best we can achieve at the moment is to have the same agreement but on a new legal basis.  During the negotiations, however, you should insist that the undertakings made in the current agreement be implemented without delay, because assessments have shown that even if there is an agreement it is not being fully and correctly implemented. I would notably point to: the switch from the pull to the push system, which is long overdue; information to passengers, which is key but which is apparently still not happening; and purpose limitation  which is a more difficult issue, but an absolutely crucial one. I hope you can see to it that the undertakings are integrated into the agreement rather than being a sort of appendix that is not legally binding.  With regard to the medium and long term  i.e. the post 2007  review  we very much hope that by then the clause will have been adopted, that Parliament will have secured codecision and that everything will be dealt with as part of a proper democratic procedure. At that point, Parliament will insist on proportionality, which is to say that there should be datasharing, because we all want a safer world and to fight the scourge of terrorism, but that this should be proportional. We should not share more data than is strictly needed to achieve our purpose. It goes without saying that there should be adequate protection of personal data and procedural safeguards. That is quite clear.  One of the proposals in the report, which fortunately received the support of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is that we start a parliamentary transatlantic dialogue. I feel that this rift with the US needs to be healed. We must fight terrorism together. It cannot be that while we call the Americans cowboys they call us cowards, and we are deeply divided.  At the same time, there are proposals circulating on a European PNR policy. I am rather unhappy that we only learned about this through the media. We have heard that this idea was presented at an informal meeting in London a couple of weeks ago. That is not the way forward. If there is to be such a policy then we would prefer that it were presented here in Parliament.  Finally, I should like to make a very urgent appeal to the Council to adopt proper arrangements for data protection under the Third Pillar, along the lines set out by our rapporteur, Mrs Roure.
65165 author: Jennifer Brown:  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the speakers for their important contributions to this discussion. As a closing remark, I would like to restate the importance of continued action to tackle air pollution. The adverse health impacts, lost economic productivity and damage to environmental quality are still much too great.  Some have criticised the strategy from one angle, some from another angle. Some consider that the proposed flexibility goes too far, others think that this flexibility is too little. We will be reviewing the strategy to see what progress has been made and how much further we can get towards the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.  I understand the concern expressed by those who want to see more Community pollution abatement measures so that the strategys objective and air quality standards can be met. I think that there is a consensus between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the measures required. In fact, the Commission has already undertaken much of the preparatory work, the fruits of which will be seen in the months to come. As a result, I do not believe that there is any need for an interinstitutional agreement in this area.  On Amendments  30  and  81 , I understand the concerns of those who call for more flexibility in implementing the existing air quality legislation. However, one cannot have flexibility without weakening the legislation. I think the Commissions proposal of five years from the entry into force of the limit values strikes the right balance and the Commission cannot support any further weakening beyond that. By way of explanation, according to the Commission proposal, the time extension will go up to the end of  2009 ; according to the general approach of the Council it will go up to  2010 ; and according to the rapporteurs amendment it will go up to  2013 . So there is a difference on this point. It is four years plus two from the entry into force of the new directive. I understand this to be the proposal tabled before this plenary.  On Amendments  46  and  82 , I should provide some further clarification about the daily limit value of PM 10 . This protects sensitive individuals against the impact from shortterm exposure to particles in the air. It is different from the annual limit value, which provides protection to all from longterm exposure. One cannot simply substitute a more stringent annual limit value for the daily limit. This is what the health experts say. The key to ensuring compliance with both daily and annual limits is to undertake good and timely air quality assessments and to take the necessary steps to reduce emissions. It is clear that many authorities have not done this and now they have compliance problems.  On Amendments  49  and  50 , the proposed concentration cap for PM 2 . 5  is set at a level consistent with the stringency of the annual limit value for PM 10 , which the Commission is not proposing to change. It is also useful to remember that the Commission has proposed two ways of tackling PM 2 . 5 : the concentration cap of  25  micrograms per cubic metre and the exposurereduction approach, where average levels in urban areas will be reduced over ten years. These methods combined will work to deliver health improvements.  Our modelling work, which underpins the thematic strategy and the air quality proposal, shows that greater health improvements can be obtained by allowing the Member States to choose where to reduce pollution levels. This is the aim of the exposure reduction targets. This flexibility will be limited if the concentration cap forces Member States to divert resources to ensure compliance in some specific hotspot regions, where few health improvements may be available. For public health, a general reduction in exposure is preferable.  In summary, on the air quality legislative proposal, I am pleased to say that the Commission can support  32  amendments, in part or in principle. I shall give Parliaments Secretariat a list detailing the Commissions position on the amendments( 1 ).
1738628 author: Nancy McNabb:  . Mr President, some  80   of our citizens live in urban areas, but their needs and interests are strongly underrepresented in Union funds, projects and initiatives. As regards the level of EU funding, these city dwellers are secondrate citizens of the European Union. The thematic strategy on the urban environment should be a brave and progressive initiative, not just a lukewarm recommendation of wishful thinking. Sadly, the Commission document on that subject is rather weak. The Sixth Environmental Action Plan has set encouraging goals, but this time the Commission failed to propose legally binding measures and deadlines. The Commission does not attempt to balance European policy between urban and rural areas and does not have any vision for a cleaner urban environment. I cannot do the job of the whole Commission, but I can at least try to propose some useful measures.  Firstly, I propose that a sustainable urban management plan and a sustainable urban transport plan should be required by Community law for every agglomeration with more than  100000  inhabitants, as proposed by the Commission in  2004 . Representatives of European cities have expressed their satisfaction with my proposal. Those kinds of binding measures make life easier for environmentconscious city councils, as they have legal bases for action on the environment.  As far as transport is concerned, nonmotorised transport should have priority over every other kind of traffic, public transport over private, small and lesspolluting cars over other vehicles. Congestion charging, as used in London and Stockholm, is a success at present. It is the only possible future for every large European city. The referendum some days ago in Stockholm showed us that people liked the idea and only a minority of certain lobbyists oppose it. I am also proposing a  5  shift in passenger kilometre from individual transport  namely cars  to public transport and cycling. Speed limits in city centres, such as in Graz, Austria, reduce accidents, save lives and reduce air pollution and noise emissions. Low emission zones are also useful in combating air pollution.  If we really want to do something about climate change, we should act in our cities as well. As the English say, charity begins at home. That should also apply to sustainable development. Due to climate change, heatwaves turn many towns and cities into hell during the hot summer days and nights. Heatwaves kill thousands of European citizens and they die a painful and humiliating death. Heatwave emergency plans are crucial for most European cities, except in some Nordic communities. The basic treatment for heatwaves is simple: more water, green roofs and facades, fresh water and natural cooling systems, reducing car traffic. Hot summers are coming and we should save the lives of city dwellers. We need more green spaces in our cities. Even some ten square metres of green islands can improve the spirit of a city, together with bigger parks and gardens nearby.  Summertime urban beaches like those in Paris, Brussels and Budapest are also useful projects for those who cannot leave the city on long vacations. In both old and new Member States, tens of millions of people live in massproduced, prefabricated housing estates. In many western cities these have become ethnic and social ghettos. Complex social, cultural, educational and environmental programmes are needed to rehabilitate those suburbs. In Central Europe, in Hungary for instance, most of those housing estates have not yet become ghettos. The majority of their dwellers still belong to the lower and middle classes. In their case, the physical state of the housing is worrying. In the EU 10  countries the repair and rehabilitation of housing estates is a crucial step forward in preserving social peace and improving city life.  As rapporteur, I accepted many amendments tabled by my colleagues in the PPEDE Group in the hope of good cooperation. I was rather surprised that the PPEDE Group then tried to kill my report by deleting all the important targets and measures in committee.  I call upon all Members to support the importance of binding targets and measures. Without them our work is just words, words, words. My report can be summed up in one sentence: less cars, more green and water. That is the only survival strategy for our cities.
6585245 author: Victor McNabb:  Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this evenings debate on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, which the European Parliament has been waiting for from the Commission with particular interest.  I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, MrHegyi, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the full and ambitious report being examined today.  I also welcome the contribution by MrNeachtain and the Committee on Transport and Tourism and by MrsKallenbach and the Committee on Regional Development.  Before I continue, I should like to share with you the welcome news that the Commissioners approved the seventh and final thematic strategy on soil last Friday. The preparation of these strategies was difficult and timeconsuming. However, a clear way forward has now been identified for topical environmental issues, which include the policy on the urban environment.  The urban environment is an important issue for us all. With the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the Commission recognised the role which the urban environment plays in the lives of so many European citizens and undertook to take action in this sector.  The urban environment directly affects the way of life of millions of European citizens and also has important repercussions on the environment in general. European cities must be viable, sustainable and offer high quality of life, so that citizens will want to live and work there and companies will invest.  Nonetheless, a great deal of effort still needs to be made in this respect. Clearly urban areas promote economic growth and have high levels of supply of and access to public services, such as education, health and transport.  The reverse side of the coin, however, is the myriad problems relating to life in the city, such as the deterioration in the environment, traffic congestion, economic and social exclusion, crime and alienation. The purpose of the strategy in question is to promote and facilitate sustainable urban growth, focusing on environmental issues such as air pollution, external noise, high levels of traffic, emissions of greenhouse gases, chaotic building development, water consumption and waste generation.  The problems were easy to identify, but finding solutions to them was very difficult. This mainly applies when the objective is to find solutions which can be tried and are viable and suitable for the plethora and variety of conditions and problems in the various cities of the European Union. That is why, despite the fact that the European Commission and the Committee on the Environment agree in substance, they disagree on the way forward.  Some people have called for more legislation and targets which will bring about improvements. I can understand that from a theoretical point of view and agree in principle. I wish that it were in fact possible for us to proceed in this manner.  Unfortunately, this is not useful or feasible and there are basic reasons why the strategy is not in favour of introducing new legislation. To be specific, the reason is that solutions must comply with the principle of subsidiarity and our cities are so different from each other that there is no common solution for them all.  We already have legislative acts which would have positive results on the urban environment if they were properly applied. We already have legislation which has a positive impact on the environment and the quality of life in cities. Just think, for example, of all the legislation we have on ambient air quality, noise, waste and water, to mention just a few of the issues covered.  Nonetheless, this legislation must be applied better. Instead of legislative solutions, the strategy proposes guidance on how to improve the management of urban areas in an integrated manner and increase sustainability in the transport which will be included in the Green Paper on urban transport which is expected to be approved in  2007 .  This will lead to better compliance with current environmental legislation and to improved cohesion between the various political and the various administrative levels. This is the approach which all the interested parties which we consulted clearly and repeatedly stated they preferred. This approach will be supplemented by other support measures, such as creating suitable structures, exchanging best practices and setting up incentives under the Community Structural Funds.  The Member States should include urban environmental issues in national programmes for funding under the Community cohesion policy, so that regional and local authorities can benefit from the funding opportunities available.
6279221 author: Michael White:  .  Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that we have been able, after longdrawn out wrangling, to agree on this document, and, moreover, that we have been able to produce it in good time before the Year of Mobility is over, for I do not think it would make much sense to roll out a Mobility Charter next year; that would not exactly have the desired effect on the outside world.  More to the point, this Charter is needed as an accompaniment to the new educational programmes that are due to start next year, in which we have put a great emphasis on quantity, in that we want, for example, to have three million students on the lifelong learning scheme by  2012 , and  80000  per annum on Leonardo. In view of that, the need for quality must not be ignored; it really must not be allowed to lose out. Quality must be guaranteed not only in the host countries in which students spend time, but also in their countries of origin, so that the best possible use can be made of their experiences when they return and can really be seen to be added.  I would also like to emphasise that mobility must not merely make them more employable; there is a purely personal benefit involved as well, for education is of value not least in that it is characterbuilding, and should therefore ultimately also contribute to greater European understanding.  The Charter is intended for all those who want to complete a formal or informal period of education or further education abroad, but there must also be a certain balance, not only for the students benefit, but also to promote the use of the Leonardo programme and create more openings for businesses to take on trainees.  While I do believe that this document can set a lot of things in motion, that will depend on how it is received in the Member States. What we have set before this House is not legally binding, and so it is for the Member States to commit themselves to doing what it calls on them to do. We know that very many resolutions are adopted in the Council and accepted without dissent in the EU or within the Council, only to be inadequately implemented at national level. That would be sure to diminish young peoples confidence in what we are doing and also in our intentions.  There are, though, a number of points I would like to highlight, some of which you, Commissioner, have mentioned. It is important that there should be a Mobility Guide containing introductory information on mobility options, grants and contact addresses. It is also important that the various educational systems be made transparent and capable of being compared with one another, so that young people can know what is in store for them in this or that country. It is also, of course, important that there should be information on the recognition of diplomas, on financial and other support, and that language barriers should be removed.  The transferability of grants  to which MrsSchppges has already referred  is absolutely vital, in that it is needed, not least, alongside logistical support, insurance, residence and work permits, accommodation and preparations for travel, and is every bit as important as the transferability of loans. The same is true of social security insurance. If young people are going to venture to make this leap and be prepared to embark on this foreign adventure, then their own countrys social security system is one of the things they have to be able to take away with them.  The intention is that the mobility charter should be seen as a frame of reference for making mobility more efficient and effective, with the persons using it having a checklist of ten matters to be sorted out before their departure, such as advice, information, and a learning plan; there are others, but it is not absolutely necessary that I discuss them now.  I would like to thank all those who have played their part in putting this compromise together. That was not an easy thing to do, but we did eventually manage it. I am glad to see that all the groups have tabled amendments or compromise amendments, and that we will, no doubt, be able to get through tomorrows vote quickly and then be able to present a good report.
4796509 author: James Smith:  .  Mr President, Commissioner Fige, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Fige for his introductory remarks, and also for having so clearly summed up the spirit of this agreement at first reading, and explained the improvements in the text that our joint efforts helped make possible, pointing out that, ambitious though it is, it is now more sensitive to social factors and more balanced, which is a triumph for our joint endeavour.  Looking back briefly, let me say that the recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning takes as its starting point the changed state of the world, with a globalised economy in which Europe stands a chance only if we provide our people with better education and training, which is why education policy is meant to be  and must be  an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy. Being a continent without much in the way of its own raw materials, our chances of having a future in a globalised economy are closely tied up with the resources of education and research; it is in peoples qualities and skills that our future potential is to be found, and that is why the Member States and the European Union must invest more in education and clarify their thinking about what skills are actually needed in a knowledgebased society. That is the purpose of the recommendations on the eight key competences, and I will repeat that these are no more than recommendations.  The key competences are: firstly, communication in ones mother tongue; secondly, communication in foreign languages; thirdly, competences in maths, science and technology; fourth, digital competence; fifth, learning to learn; sixth, interpersonal, intercultural and social competences, and civic competence; seventh, entrepreneurship, and the eighth is cultural expression. All of them are needed for social cohesion, employability and personal development. It is intended that the Member States should be supported making policies enabling all young people, once their basic education is completed, to possess sufficient key competences to be able to embark on adult life, and adults to develop these competences in line with the latest knowledge throughout their lives.  The key competences are not ranked in any kind of hierarchy; while they are all equal in value, they do of course overlap, and they all contribute towards a successful life in a knowledgebased society. These competences are defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is the key competences that we all need if we are to enjoy personal satisfaction in the knowledge society, that we need for our own personal development, for active participation, social integration and employment. The concept of mankind underpinning this definition of key competences bears the stamp of humanism, and what breathes life into this recommendation is the idea that competences are not to be considered solely in terms of the uses to which they can be put, but that 103 limits in time, until 1 April 2008 , the possibility for the Commission to grant such authorisations. Imposing such a sunset clause is clearly not in line with the recent agreement on the revised comitology procedure. As part of this deal both the Council and Parliament agreed not to limit in time the powers granted to the Commission. For the same reasons, Amendments 20 , 22 and 24 are not acceptable either. Some of you have raised the SWIFT crisis widely reported in the media during the last few weeks. You are aware that the issue is on Parliaments agenda later this week and my colleague Mr Frattini will make a declaration on behalf of the Commission. We will make sure that we have all the facts of this case before taking any decision on further action. As far as this regulation is concerned, the Commission considers that it contains the appropriate standards on data protection and access by the competent authorities to such data. Your rapporteur had the foresight to submit the proposal to the European Data Protection Supervisor, who gave a positive assessment. No problems were detected on data protection issues. Let me stress once more that noncompliance by 1 January 2007 education is always of value in itself as well.  This concept of key skills includes such attitudes as critical thinking, creativity, the seizing of initiative, problemsolving, the willingness to take risks, decisionmaking and entrepreneurial flair. As I see it, we have, politically speaking, opted for the right approach in giving the Member States these definitions as guidelines for their educational policies, thereby enabling them to prepare themselves better for the future. My particular concern was that it should, in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, be made clear that, no matter how ambitious these key skills are  for we must all keep on learning if we are to succeed and be content in a knowledgebased society  the social aspect must not be forgotten, for not everyone starts from the same point or with the same opportunities. That is why it is particularly important to help and support people with learning difficulties by reason of their background or social position, those who have dropped out of school, people with poor literacy skills, the longterm unemployed or people who want to get back to work after a long break, not least  and in particular  women returning to work after having children. All these circumstances need to be taken into account if people are to be given the specific help they need to make use of their educational opportunities.  Following a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council, we were able to agree on a recommendation that is socially aware and emphasises gender equality, while at the same time being very ambitious. I regard this compromise as a good one, and so my recommendation to all the Members of this House is that they adopt this text in the version agreed at first reading. The negotiations were constructive and interesting, and for that I want to extend the warmest of thanks to the Members of this House, to the Commission and to the Council.
9175324 author: Christoph Whittacker:  . Mr President, the purpose of this report is very clear and specific. It calls upon the Council of Ministers to give a fresh impetus to the inclusion and enhancement of the European dimension in school curricula. That is a national competence and the national, regional, and educational authorities in our Member States vary. However, this Parliament is totally within its rights  and indeed has a duty  to remind the Council of Ministers that it passed a resolution back in May  1988  calling for the enhancement of the European dimension in education. It is the virtually unanimous feeling of the committee that it is high time that this was updated. So what are the practical steps?  First of all, the European dimension should not simply be a vague platitude, a notion that governments pay lipservice to but in actual fact do very little to achieve. I hope attention has been drawn to this in committee and I hope that the Finnish Presidency will be able to confirm by correspondence that this item will be included on the agenda of the next Council of Education Ministers meeting in Brussels on  13 November. I look forward to receiving confirmation of that. We think that there should be a discussion by our ministers, specifically about what the European dimension entails.  As far as Parliaments committee is concerned, we have looked at two aspects. Firstly, in citizenship classes, what used to be called civics: an understanding of what the EU is, how its institutions operate and, in particular, the democratic input of individuals, interests and concerns in the decisionmaking; and second, and equally important, an understanding of our common cultural and historical heritage. Parliament held a hearing on the teaching of history and its European dimension two years ago. Of course, national stories are the foundation stone of an understanding of our past, but it is impossible to teach the classical empires of Greece and Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Napoleonic wars, the Industrial Revolution, the struggles between democracies and dictatorship without reference to the European context.  We also dwell specifically on the importance of language teaching. That has declined very significantly in my own country in recent years. In the last two years, the number of  16 yearold students studying languages has dropped by as much as  14 , as our government has made it an option rather than a compulsory element of the curriculum.  Looking across Europe, our understanding and our use of languages is very imbalanced. As English increasingly becomes a lingua franca, for those of us with English as our mother tongue that is a real problem in terms of motivating students to study and teachers to teach foreign languages. And yet without that cultural understanding that goes with an understanding of language, how on earth are we going to be able to cooperate properly and enrich the content of our educational syllabuses?  With regard to teacher awareness, I mentioned that there is a disparity, not only across the EU but within Member States. Some schools pay considerable attention to the European dimension, fully engaging in European exchange programmes, for example, using not simply resources from the EU but national and independent resources, television and newspaper archive material, while others concentrate hardly at all on the European dimension. Therefore we have a scatter effect.  It is important that teacher training courses should offer potential teachers the opportunity to be aware of what teaching materials are available and how they can fit into curricula.  I draw your attention to paragraph  13  of the report, which we are grateful to Mrs Novak for incorporating. It states that: The European dimension complements national content. It neither replaces nor supplants it. There is a very small fringe of people who would attack this report and say that it is all about propaganda, trying to force people to see only the rosy and beneficial side of the European Union. I would return that taunt by saying that it is they who would seek to deny information, who are actually distorting the picture, depriving our students of the opportunity to make a balanced judgment of their own and to consider what their career opportunities might be, because they have had the full information given to them consistently, throughout their time at school.  This report is a call to the Council of Ministers for action. We look forward to seeing the positive results.
3287877 author: Annette Cameron:  . Mr President, this is a package of issues that shows that education and training is getting a momentum. I am sure that EQF is one of points for the coming years. When I was asked about the top issues in my portfolio for the next five years, I said that EQF is one of them and so I think we are delivering it now; not only speaking about it.  First of all, I would like to express gratitude to the rapporteur and to the Employment Committee, for the excellent report prepared in consultation with other committees, which reflects the Commissions consultation paper from last year. It gives us the opportunity to reflect the formal proposal adopted this month, because I am sure that lifelong learning and mobility are crucial to our competitiveness and social cohesion in the European Union.  The Commission has always taken positive steps to make progress in these fields. However, in practice people in Europe still too often face obstacles when they try to move from one country to another to learn or work, and when they want to become citizens more than tourists in the Union. They also face difficulties when they want to build on previous education and training and move, for example, from vocational education and training into higher education. The EQF will help to solve that problem. It will improve transparency and make different national qualifications systems or qualifications frameworks more understandable across Europe. By helping different systems to talk to each other, it will promote access to education and training and increase mobility for learning or work. It could also be instrumental outside Europe, because when I was in Moscow or, in June, in Canada, both countries  Russia and Canada  expressed interest in knowing more about this instrument because they would like it to inspire their policies.  We already have legal instruments, such as the directives on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. The Europass initiative has been mentioned today, which also pursues similar goals. However, these instruments alone are not sufficient, which is why the EQF is an important further step to improve the situation.  Our proposal already integrates many of the comments and recommendations contained in Mr Manns report; I am sure we can agree on that. I therefore consider that Parliament and the Commission are very much following the same line on this issue. The document on which you have commented was a consultation paper issued in July last year. Since then, we have moved further on the road towards a more practical and userfriendly instrument.  Mr Mann is right to say that we should do more on vocational education and training. I would like to remind you that it came into the treaties in the Treaty of Rome, in  1957 ; and higher education not until the Maastricht Treaty; in  1999  we started the Bologna process, and only later on the Copenhagen process. Now we have two parallel processes, which feed well into the European qualifications framework, but we need it to get there in order to start the real implementation of important clauses in our treaties. We are doing that now: in the Bologna process,  45  countries; in Copenhagen,  32 . Two weeks ago I was in Switzerland and they want to join the Copenhagen process. So those are good messages for our work.  EQF will provide the full benefit only if correctly implemented by Member States. They will need to link their qualification systems to the EQF. I am convinced that our proposal provides the common language and the means to develop the necessary mutual trust, which is the basis for real implementation of such an instrument. That strategy is also helpful to employers and individuals in comparing qualifications across the Union and across diverse education and training systems.  I am sure that this key initiative is helping people in Europe to face the challenges and reap the benefits of a knowledgebased society. We are looking forward not only to further discussions but also to further cooperation following the recent adoption of the proposal.
1121503 author: Amy Whittacker:  . Mr President, I would like to join President Barroso in congratulating Bulgaria and Romania on their historic achievement. Over the past months, both countries have demonstrated their readiness to join the European Union. The key to this success was a combination of substantial Bulgarian and Romanian efforts with the strong encouragement and support of the Union. Let me also join President Barroso in thanking the European Parliament for its continuous support for the gradual and carefully managed accession process to the Union.  The Commissions assessment is based on an even more rigorous system of conditionality than the one applied in the past. Over the past two years in particular, Bulgaria and Romania have responded strongly to our system of conditionality. This has resulted in a remarkable transformation, with reforms in several sectors peaking over the past three to four months. Thus, the strategy we devised together last May has worked well, to the benefit of Europe, Bulgaria and Romania.  Todays report focuses on those areas which required further progress in May. The majority of Bulgarias and Romanias overall preparations had already been completed by that time.  In terms of the political criteria, Bulgaria has continued the reform of the judiciary. The legal framework has improved, for instance, through the adoption of rules that establish objective procedures for the appointment and evaluation of magistrates, which is very important for the independence of the court systems. The ongoing preparations of constitutional reform in that regard are also very welcome.  Efforts to combat corruption have resulted in more officials having to declare their personal assets and in the establishment of internal fraud inspectorates. The Prosecutor General has continued to be proactive in terms of requests for lifting the immunity of members of parliament.  In the fight against organised crime, more specialists have been recruited and some successful actions have been registered against criminal networks. However, at the moment the number of successful prosecutions is still low and the implementation record still needs to be improved.  Romania has made further progress in reforming its justice system and the results are tangible and positive. The interpretation and application of the law is being further harmonised and staffing levels in the judicial system are increasing.  There has been definite and tangible progress in the fight against corruption. Criminal liability has been broadened to legal persons and rules on financing for political parties have been tightened. This has led to further nonpartisan investigations and indictments of highlevel corruption.  The report outlines a limited number of areas where we need to see further progress in the months leading up to accession and beyond. Therefore, this report also spells out accompanying measures which the Commission will initiate upon accession, unless the remaining concerns have been remedied.  The Commission will set up a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime. For this purpose, as President Barroso said, benchmarks have been established which refer to the particular circumstances of each country. The mechanism allows the Commission to help the countries to continue the reforms with vigour and rigour, and to verify that the expected progress is taking place on the ground.  The Commission will also ask both Bulgaria and Romania to report biannually on progress in addressing these specific benchmarks until they have been met. The first report should be submitted by the end of March  2007 . We will then report to the European Parliament and to the Council by June  2007 . The Commission will also apply the safeguard measures of the Accession Treaty if either country fails to address the benchmarks adequately. The report also underlines that EU rules contain the necessary guarantees for the proper management of EU agricultural and structural funds.  The new regulation on structural funds provides the mechanisms to ensure that these funds, which are of course EUtaxpayers money, are spent properly. Payments can be interrupted, suspended or cancelled, if the Commission suspects or detects cases of irregularities or fraud, including corrupt practices. Moreoverfurther to this range of safeguard measures for the EU funds, financial corrections can take place if individual or systemic irregularities are found in the regular financial controls.  There is still a risk that preparations for the management of agricultural funds may not have been completed by the time of accession. As a precaution, we have adopted specific provisions to ensure the proper management of these funds by Bulgaria and Romania.  This gives both countries time to complete preparations in  2007 . At the same time, failure to do so will enable the Commission to reduce the payments in  2007 . Of course, we hope that we will not have to resort to this mechanism, which should be seen as an incentive for both Bulgaria and Romania.  As to the third safeguard measure, food safety, some measures are currently in place because of animal diseases. These will be maintained after accession. Restrictions may also need to be applied upon accession on the use of certain animal byproducts. Noncompliant food establishments in the milk, meat and fish sectors will be denied access to the internal market, but will be allowed to produce for the national market bearing a specific label. After three years, they will have to comply with EU rules or close down.  I have outlined the sufficient guarantees offered by the and the Accession Treaty. I am therefore confident that Bulgaria and Romania will enrich the Union without compromising the proper functioning of EU policies and institutions. The interests of the EU and our citizens can be assured and EU taxpayers money protected.  Overall, Bulgaria and Romania should be commended for their farreaching efforts and achievements to adapt their legislation and administration to the laws and rules of the European Union. On the basis of the progress made, our report shows that both countries will be ready to join the Union in  2007 . The suggested accompanying measures will ensure the continuity and irreversibility of the reforms in the two countries.  I trust that we can count on your support for facilitating a swift and successful ratification of the Accession Treaty in the remaining Member States. Bulgaria and Romania have undertaken remarkable efforts to join us in the European Union and they deserve our congratulations and a very warm welcome.
5644967 author: Sebastian Bush:  . Mr President, there is a Romanian proverb: . It means where there are two or more, we are stronger. Well, there are two: Bulgaria and Romania recognise that they will be stronger in the European Union and the European Union will be stronger with Romania and Bulgaria.  Size matters. With the 29 June and 1 July, Mariann Fischer Boel and I attended ministerial meetings in Geneva on the Doha Round of trade talks. We also met and remained in contact with the MEPs who were present in Geneva during those days. I would like to thank the honourable Members of this House for their effort and for their commitment. It is much appreciated by the Commission. The ministerial meetings did not find agreement on the main parameters for reductions in tariffs and subsidies, in agriculture and industrial goods, the socalled modalities of the agreement which are necessary to move to the final stage in the talks. We met several times with the ministers from the Group of Six, that is ourselves in Europe, the United States, Brazil, India, Japan and Australia. We also met in the Green Room format of 30 ministers and in the Trade Negotiations Committee, which brings together the entire WTO membership. There was no shortage of ministerial meetings and encounters, but the encounters were frankly better than the quality of the negotiations that took place within those encounters. We went into the discussions stressing the EUs agreement with a principle expressed by Pascal Lamy beforehand, that the landing zone for an agreement would require effective real cuts in farm subsidies by all and real cuts in both agricultural and nonagricultural market access real cuts in tariffs. We then specified that to capture such a basis for agreement we would on our side be prepared to move towards and close to the level of average cuts in farm tariffs proposed for developed countries by the G 20 , provided that others moved in concert, with a similar level of ambition in other areas of the negotiation. We made it clear to our partners that we would not be prepared to meet every G 20 demand, in particular on the structure of the cuts. We pushed hard to establish a clear correspondence between the effort that we would make in agricultural market access and the effort that the United States in turn would have to make in the reduction of domestic subsidies close to the G 20 levels of average cut by us, to be matched by close to G 20 supranational challenges we face in todays world, the more countries that share our values and practise good government and democracy within our Union, the more able we will be to promote those values beyond it. So I salute the people of Romania and Bulgaria. I salute their governments, in which Liberals and Democrats are proud to play an important role. I salute, in particular, Meglena Kuneva and Anca Boagiu, who have conducted the detailed negotiations on behalf of their countries like a pair of swans, apparently gliding serenely across the surface of the water but with their feet paddling away ten to the dozen underneath.  I express my thanks to the European Commission, and in particular to Commissioner Rehn, for a difficult task imaginatively tackled and accomplished appropriately under a Finnish Presidency.  We all recognise that there is unfinished business. The European Union is a moving target with the constantly evolving. Bulgaria and Romania are developing themselves. We know that democracies are sometimes run by crisis management: often problems are often not solved until they have to be solved. We acknowledge that there is only a certain elasticity in the management of public affairs. Moreover, we recognise that there is a need, as in previous enlargements, for transition periods and safeguard clauses.  I urge the governments and people of both countries to continue their reforms, but to those who doubt their readiness I ask, would they be better off and would we be better off with them outside? Should we say no or not yet? As the American commentator Mencken once said, that For every complex problem there is an answer which is clear, simple and wrong. Leaving them outside the Union would be the wrong answer.  I am pleased, however, that the Commission draws attention in its report to the need for greater efforts in the fight against crime and the need for more serious efforts in improving the situation of the Roma people in both the countries joining us. The rule of law and social inclusion are fundaments of our Union. More action needs to be taken by the governments of both countries and the Commission needs to monitor that action on our behalf.  What matters to the health of a society is less what it possesses than the direction in which its face is set. It seems to me that the direction of both countries is the right one. To quote from the hymn to St Cyril and St Methodius: March ahead, oh revived people, to your future march ahead, forge your destiny of glory .... Forge it with us.  There is work to be done in Romania and Bulgaria to make the European Union a reality. We build the European Union together. It will never be built purely from the top down. It must be built from the ground up. That was perhaps summed up by the Romanian writer Adrian Marino, when he wrote:  We must bring Europe into our homes.  But there is work to be done in the European Union, too, to convince our citizens that the cost they are paying for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is not a net negative. To explain to them, as the pidla report showed us, that those countries which welcome new countries as partners gain economic benefits. To point out to them that unless we let lowcost labour come to where the investment is, then the investment will go to where the lowcost labour is. It is a winwin calculation in bringing new countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into the Union. We will all be winners.  There are some who ask whether this will be the last enlargement. I believe that our Member States will be obliged to sort out Europes constitutional challenges before new countries are taken in. I hope that is what the Commission President meant when he said that this might be the last enlargement. We owe our citizens and the citizens of these two future Member States the duty of sorting our Europes constitution before we take in further countries. In conclusion, let us welcome Romania and Bulgaria today, not in a spirit of triumph but in a spirit of satisfaction with work well accomplished.
873206 author: Helen Brown:  . Mr President, we are bringing to the final debate this report on Turkey at a special moment. This report is preceding the European Commissions progress report, and therefore provides a unique opportunity to influence and enrich the stance of the European Commission.  This does not mean, however, that there would be so much need to influence the Commission on this point, because the report as I have presented it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and as I present it now here in this sitting, has been prepared in very good cooperation with the European Commission and with Commissioner Rehn himself. I also think of Mr Rehns words when I presented the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, words of welcome which were very clear.  The Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted the report by a large majority:  54  votes to  6 . The report has been described as fair but tough: fair because it is based on facts and is constructive; tough because, unfortunately, there is reason for criticism of at least a strong push from Parliament.  The basic conclusion of the report is that we, as the European Parliament, regret that there is a slowdown in reforms. We had expected at the start of the negotiations in  2004 , when we made a decision, that the impressive reforms of  20022004  would continue. Unfortunately they have slowed down. That is not to say that nothing has happened. I compliment the Turkish politicians on their ninth package of legislative reforms and the many proposals that were adopted by Parliament. I also compliment the Turkish officials for their professional work in the negotiations so that the first chapter could be provisionally closed.  So why then is there criticism? Because we would have liked to have seen more progress in the mainstream of further political reforms. I will mention a few vital areas. Firstly, on freedom of expression, we as a Parliament have already criticised some parts of the new penal code. Although it was a big improvement, some articles raised doubts  Article  301 , first and foremost. Some people have been set free. However, the reconfirmation of the sentence of Mr Hrant Dink proves, as Ali Birand, the famous journalist, also stated so clearly, that Article  301  has to be changed or repealed. I ask the Turkish Government and the Turkish people to see the need for this. It is important for the freedom of the Turkish people, it is important for the image of Turkey in Europe and the wider world.  Second, a lot needs to be done as regards freedom of religion. I was in Turkey a few weeks ago. Until recently, monasteries and churches have been taken away, and the new proposed law on foundation, as the Commissioner said, is not good enough. So please let this stop. Give back the properties to the religious minorities and change the proposal of the law on foundation so that if they cannot be given back, then at least there is a good compensation for the minority churches.  Also, the training of clergy must resume. Since  1971  seminaries are closed, and for a country that wants to be European, it is very important that it should be as easy to build a Christian church in Turkey as it is to build a Turkish mosque in the rest of the European Union.  We said we want priority for these reforms because that is the European spirit. We ask it as a Parliament, and Turkey signed, in the revised accession partnership, a commitment to achieve the shortterm priorities before the end of  2007 , and then we as a Parliament asked Turkey to do what was agreed.  A third situation that worries us is the situation in the southeast. We strongly condemn the PKK and any terrorism. We strongly condemn it  there is never any excuse for terrorism; but at the same time we ask Turkey to try to find peaceful interlocutors, try to find a political way and invest in the social and economic development of the southeast.  A last major point: Cyprus. It was agreed at the start of negotiations that there would be no formal recognition ceremony by Turkey of Cyprus but that there would be an Ankara Protocol as a kind of normalisation of relations. The protocol was signed, the Council asked for it to be implemented before the end of  2006 , and it is now a matter of credibility  also for the credibility of our institutions  that Turkey fulfils its commitments and implements a protocol before the end of  2006 . As a Parliament, we also make it very clear that we want to see more efforts in the northern part of the island in terms of trade regulation. But once again, Turkey cannot just sign up to this: it should do what it promised to do.  I shall finish with one last point  I shall try to make it short. There was a vast majority in the committee for the basic line of the report and I thank the Members for it because with it we are giving an important signal. There was unease, however, because of an amendment on the Armenian genocide. Allow me in two sentences to make my position clear. In paragraph  50  of the report, as rapporteur I tried to put forward a position that is both strong but also realistic. It says that recognition as such is formally not a criterion, but for a country on its road to Europe it is indispensable to come to terms with its past and therefore we want committees, research, open discussion. I think that is a line that is strong but fair and beyond criticism.  I know that, with an amendment from Mrs De Keyser, another text has been voted in as well. It is of course the responsibility of every Member of Parliament to vote as he or she pleases, but if you ask for my opinion, the text in paragraph  50  is the best text and the one that takes us the furthest.  I have been speaking for too long. I want to thank Members once again for their support up till now and I just want to say that I hope, as the rapporteur for Turkish accession, that this signal  a tough but fair signal  will be perceived by Turkish politicians and the Turkish public as an encouragement to restart the reform process, to vigorously support those people who want it, so that I as rapporteur can be more positive in my next report than I have been here today.
7055791 author: Jennifer Bush:  . Within this question there are seven subquestions, and I would like to be as precise and technical as possible because the questions were very specific and precise from an accounting point of view.  Your question mainly relates to our manning budget, where we are asking to create a budgetary line which would enable the Commission, where duly justified, to write off items in suspense accounts, and to write off losses which inevitably accrue in an administration managers funds in accounts throughout  145 countries, sometimes with a weak banking sector and other political disturbances.  The creation of this budget line reflects the Commissions policy of administrative rigour and transparency, to clear up all files, mostly relating to the years before  2000 . That is mainly because we are now introducing a new accrualbased accounting system which allows us, and compels us, to be more transparent and more rigorous with our accounting system.  This proposal for a new budgetary line was presented in the amended Budget  5 , to the budget line  40 , and lists the following five types of operations which we will be looking into. The first is adjustments to cover amounts deposited in accounts in banks outside the European Union which have gone bankrupt during the previous year. The second is cash differences in imprest accounts. The third is settlement on some longstanding operations carried out mainly by delegations and representations under the imprest arrangements abroad. The fourth is repayments of principal andor late payment interest and whether they were set off, and clearance of nonrecoverable amounts of VAT.  Each year, the Commission will include this budgetary line in its PDB proposal, as it is now common practice to write off nonrecoverable expenditure and not leave it in suspense accounts indefinitely, which was the practice in the past. The definition of a suspense account is that it is not just a bank account, but accounting records, in which the Commissions annual financial statements are listed outside the EU budget accounts because they correspond to operations which are waiting to be regularised from an accounting point of view, but cannot be attributed by any specific EU budget line for various reasons explained above. There is therefore no link with the bank accounts mentioned in my answer of  2  July this year, where the accounts were opened or managed by staff other than the accounting officer, both inside and outside the territory of the European Union.  As regards the Court of Auditors  2005  annual report, this proposal also has no link whatever with that publication, other than the fact that the Court constantly presses the Commission to clear up these suspense accounts. It was presented in good time for the suspense account to be cleared up before the end of the present financial year. We did this with the amended budget.  As regards the main types of operation in a number of accounts which you ask about in your question and the amounts of money involved, I can provide some examples today. For example, funds lost following bankruptcies amount to about EUR  1 . 3  million, concerning mainly EUR  1 million in Kazakhstan in  1996 . Funds lost from burdens of the past, for example, amount presently to EUR  3 . 5  million from imprest accounts held outside the European Union and only EUR  100000  from imprest accounts held by representations. This is due to many different circumstances where the supporting documents that are needed to justify otherwise regular expenditure cannot be traced, despite long searches. All these amounts relate to years before  2000 .  Finally, I just want to say that the creation of this budget line is not only part of the current process to modernise the Commissions accounting system; it also reflects the Commission policy of administrative rigour and transparency to clear up all old files, which will become common practice from  2006 , and we will do it every year.  Despite the thorough inventory, I want to confirm that no bank accounts were found that have been unknown to the Commission at this stage.
9292272 author: Marc Cameron:  Mr President, as the geopolitical centre of gravity shifts to Asia in the  21 st century, if you look at India you see the future. Considering its size and complexity, Indias stable and vibrant society remains a monumental achievement. Its commitment to democracy, pluralism and the rule of law guarantees consistency in trade relations. Yet, for a country approaching a fifth of the worlds population, India counts for less than one fiftieth of world trade.  As Indias largest trading partner and principal source of foreign investment, the EU is poised to help India reap the benefits of liberalisation. With our shared history and commitment to secular government and religious pluralism, the EU and India are natural partners. We became strategic partners in June  2004 , yet it was another year before a joint action plan was agreed. Even today, the Commissioner lacks the authorisation to turn the work of the highlevel trade groups into a concrete deal. In the meantime, President Bush has succeeded in brokering a quite frankly worrying USIndia nuclear deal.  The Commissioner claims India as his destination of choice  and of course I mean Commissioner Mandelson here  yet has fuelled EU obsession with China. India poses equal, if distinct, challenges for the EU and the Commission must reflect that as it lays out its new strategy by working with stakeholders to mirror its China consultation.  The Doha round remains the chief mechanism for shaping equitable globalisation. The multilateral trading system is a most just and effective way of expanding and managing trade and it shields the weak from the use and abuse in the unilateral scramble for trade domination. However, a Doha deal does not preclude bilateral WTOplus arrangements. Only through greater openness to partnerships that go beyond what a lowest common denominator WTO deal could now provide, will the EU begin to address the global competitiveness agenda of the future.  A free trade agreement with India must be central to the Commissions new global Europe strategy. This House must back the Commissioner  100  as he makes the case to the Council for a negotiating mandate to deliver bilateral FTAs, opening markets and securing fairer trading conditions in new areas of growth throughout Asia.  India must match our resolve and bolster its promises for Helsinki. India has proved itself adept at juggling global players to boost competitiveness. It is time for a deal with its most obvious partner. Deadlines must be set so that we can achieve common ambitions in the areas that will dictate the terms of the  21 st century: protection of intellectual property rights, open markets for services and investment, and effective trade defence instruments.  No strategy for economic growth is complete without addressing the growing crisis of climate change. The impact of growth in Asia on energy supply is phenomenal. Indias future growth is dependent on meeting spiralling energy needs. Severe shortages and overdependency on petrol and coal are driving up costs and pollution. An effort to develop nuclear energy is symptomatic of that crisis. However, even if India did develop nuclear energy it would meet only  2  of total energy requirements. It would also constitute a climbdown from Gleneagles pledges to halt climate change and promote energy conservation.  Both India and the EU have long traditions of promoting renewable energy. India has built the worlds fourth largest wind power industry, developed biogas digesters and solar cells and supported the development of renewable energy in Asia. We must work together to define the global energy architecture through innovation and sustainable energy development whilst meeting climate change benchmarks.  Indias economic growth is booming at  8  and is set to double in a decade. Dotcom benefactors make up Indias rich list, cashing in as India becomes the global hub for ITC development. Yet Indias economy remains full of paradoxes. The uneven distribution of the benefits of globalisation has left nearly four million people living on less than one dollar per day.  The EU must ensure that the benefits of our trading relationship are shared with Indians  all of them. International trade can be a powerful driver of economic growth and poverty reduction but it is not a silver bullet. To continue to lift people out of pockets of poverty, Indias trade reforms must complement development policies.  Linking external and internal policies is not aided by Indias infrastructure, which displays characteristics of a developing nation while seats of enterprise dominate the skylines of Mumbai and Bangalore. Investment must focus on rural areas, providing better water supplies and sanitation, improving transport links and the quality of grid power output.  India is committed to the Millennium Development Goals and its own fiveyear plan exceeds UN expectations, but there is increased doubt that India will meet four out of the eight goals on schedule. Serious concerns remain over child labour and the spread of HIVAIDS has a potential to disrupt Indias progress.  Trade relations cannot be divorced from human rights and development concerns. We have a duty to India to reverse those trends. EU assistance must be directed to lagging regions and underrepresented social groups. Capacitybuilding efforts must focus on the poorest states, enabling them to use funds effectively. Foreign investment must provide funds for education and rural health.  As India moves from developing to developed, it bears regional responsibility and sustained growth. It must take its neighbours with it. SAFTA will bring manifold expansion in the region. True, it has not been smooth sailing and IndoPak disputes have stalled progress, but strong leadership in the region has led to trade now being used as a confidencebuilding measure, particularly over Kashmir.  Europe must look at Asia and consider its astonishing growth as an opportunity rather than a threat. The EU needs more confidence about its ability to manage change and remain competitive. Inevitably it will require some restructuring and a change of mindset.
2942619 author: Roger Corless:  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karim, and the International Trade Committee, for the excellent work that has been done.  The report is comprehensive, addressing almost all possible aspects of EUIndia economic and trade relations. This report is also timely, as it takes place ahead of the forthcoming EUIndia Summit in Helsinki on  13  October  2006 , and we will take its recommendations into consideration. Our cooperation with India is manifold and it is difficult to address it exhaustively in this speech. Therefore, I will point to some of the main features that respond to your concerns and also update the House in more detail on the trade and investment issues.  Generally, our cooperation is good and is making progress. Regarding the environment, for instance, last year India hosted the first EUIndia forum on waste management, which was followed by various visits by and meetings of the working party on that issue. The holding of the second Environment Forum is under discussion.  Regarding employment and social issues, the Commission and the Indian Labour Minister agreed in a bilateral meeting a work programme for  2006  and  2007  based on the Joint Action Plan. A draft memorandum of understanding is to be signed, or initialled, at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit. More broadly, following a bilateral meeting between Commissioner Almunia and the Indian Finance Minister, the launch of regular macroeconomic dialogue has been proposed.  The business side has not been forgotten and thanks to Commissioner Mandelson, who pushed forward the idea with his counterpart Trade Minister Nath, the EUIndia CEO Round Table, allowing active businesstobusiness dialogue, is now ready to be launched at the Business Summit on  12  October  2006 .  Our development cooperation is concentrated on sector support for elementary education, health and family welfare. Poverty alleviation has been the central objective in all projects. The Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for  2007  to  2013  reaffirms that commitment with an approximately  65 to 70  allocation to the health and education sectors. Encouragingly, our State Partnership Programmes with Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, amounting to a total contribution of EUR 160  million towards supporting water management, education and health, have been signed and can now be implemented.  Turning to trade and investment relations with India, I welcome the fact that the conclusions of the report adopted by the International Trade Committee fully support the Commissions approach. More specifically, the Committee has called on the European Union to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. India is keen to launch a free trade agreement with the European Union as soon as possible. This has been the Indian position for a long time, pushed by Prime Minister Singh himself.  I welcome the committees first comment that negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) are not incompatible with bilateral WTOplus negotiations. The European Union seeks to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral WTO trading system with a new generation of bilateral FTAs, in particular with key growing markets in Asia. The European Union continues to see the WTO as the fundamental platform on which to build global liberalisation.  There will be no retreat from multilateralism. An EUIndia FTA can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement markets, competition policy and regulatory harmonisation, that are related directly to EU trading strengths not yet fully addressed by WTO rules or standards.  We have made sure that the economic case for an EUIndia FTA is watertight and that there is a similar level of understanding and ambition on Indias part, which is necessary for any negotiation to work. To that end, I welcome the committees support for the High Level Trade Groups work. On  19  September  2006 , the High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the EUIndia Summit on  13  October  2006 , which recommended that an expandedtrade partnership be developed through the negotiation of a broadbased trade and investment agreement.  The summit will recommend that both EU and India move towards negotiations for such an agreement. Although we will not be launching an FTA at the summit, we will, however, be making positive signals that we are heading in that direction. We do not just want to launch but to prepare the ground for successful negotiations. This may mean further work on some of the more sensitive issues after the summit, so that we improve understanding of each others expectations and possibilities for movement. Accordingly, I share the committees views that there is a need to deepen discussion on services negotiations, intellectual property rights and public procurement.  Finally, I also share the committees concern about the low level of intraregional trade in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its recommendation to SAARC to review opportunities to expand trade and investment in the region. We are following closely the problem of Pakistans nonimplementation of schedules under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement and addressing this informally with this country.
8577395 author: Annette White:  Mr President, thank you for your comments, from which it is clear that we all attach great importance to comprehensive relations between the Union and India.  Only last week, on  19  September  2006 , the EUIndia High Level Trade Group finalised its report to the  13 October  2006  EUIndia Summit and concluded that an expanded trade partnership should be developed through the negotiation of a broadbased trade and investment agreement. This forms the basis for the High Level Trade Groups recommendation to the EUIndia Summit. It augurs well for an agreement at the summit that there is a strong case for launching bilateral FTA negotiations and that the parties are ready to take the necessary steps to start negotiations.  The areas forming the basis of bilateral EUIndia relations, as covered by the three EUIndia Subcommittee meetings, range from economic policy, dialogue and cooperation, including on industrial policy, science and technology, finance and monetary affairs, the environment, clean development and climate change, energy cooperation, information and communication technologies, civil aviation, maritime transport, space technology, agriculture and marine policy, customs, employment and social policy, business cooperation and development cooperation, to trade and investment and the bringing together of peoples and cultures. Many of those areas will no doubt form the subject of discussions at the EUIndia Business Summit on  12 October  2006  and the Political Summit on  13  October  2006 , with a view to making progress in all areas of EUIndia relations.  It is in our mutual interest to build on a rich history of experience and partnership with India. The issue of the free trade agreement with India presents us with a number of possibilities. An agreement with India would present various advantages, such as the consolidation of the European Unions privileged position in an important and growing market. India is the only major emerging economy with the European Union as both its largest trading partner and its largest investor. Whilst there have been sizeable reforms, access to Indias market is still very restricted, with applied tariffs in certain sectors at over  30  and many caps on foreign direct investment (FDI) in the services sector. The reduction of tariffs for EU companies and the liberalisation of trade in services would secure access to a rapidly growing market and thereby contribute to competitiveness.  A secondary benefit would be to lock in Indias economic reforms to the advantage of its and the regions longterm economic growth. The visibility and economic benefits of an FTA with the European Union would support Indias programme of reforms and provide a more stable investment climate.  The Doha development agenda does not preclude bilateral free trade agreements, and the conclusion of such free trade agreements does not and would not prejudice the completion of the Doha development agenda. The European Union and India remain committed to the rulesbased multilateral trading system. The successful outcome of the DDA multilateral trade negotiations remains their foremost tradepolicy priority. India and the Union will continue to collaborate closely on mutual interests and to play leading roles regarding the DDA.  In the speech which Commissioner Mandelson delivered in Berlin on  18 September  2006 , he indicated that the central strand of the October trade policy review would argue that the EU should seek to build on and complement its commitment to the multilateral trading system with a new generation of bilateral free trade agreements with key growing markets.  While Europe continues to be highly competitive in global export markets, European companies are losing ground in the highest technology products and the fastest growing markets. In rapidly growing regions such as Asia, the European Union is underperforming. There is now a case for new bilateral free trade agreements designed to deliver more open markets. FTAs can build on WTO multilateral liberalisation by addressing areas, such as trade and services, public procurement and competition policy, that are not yet fully addressed by WTO rules. In this respect, the deepening of EUIndia bilateral trade relations supports the larger multilateral trading regime.  Finally, as many of you have said during the discussion, strengthening EUIndia relations represents a great hope: that of reducing the wealth gap existing in that country, of improving the conditions for workers and ensuring better standards of protection for all workers, in particular for women and children, and of improving the quality of life of the Indian people in general which, as has rightly been pointed out, is still such that  190 million people live on less than USD 1  a day.
7498620 author: Victor Green:  Madam President, my colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, regrets not being able to be here for this very important debate, but he has had to travel to the United States for multilateral discussions.  The European Commission welcomes the report of the Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality. For the European Union, the purpose of global governance is to make possible development that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. That is why we wish to promote policies that provide sustainable responses to genderbased issues, whether they are countries domestic policies in some cases backed by international aid, common policies such as those forming the building blocks of the European Union, or international commitments.  Trade liberalisation has provided new opportunities for many women in developing countries, providing new employment and in many cases reducing the gender gap in wages, leading to greater empowerment and social standing of women in society. Nonetheless, the rapid changes in national economies that can result from globalisation also provide challenges to policymakers to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of globalisation are maximised and the shortterm costs in certain sectors are minimised.  The European Commission believes that clear social conditions underpin sustainable productivity growth and promote the efficient production of highquality goods and services generating a net added value. Policies that mitigate the adverse effects of a changing economy on specific groups of people or regions, good social services and social protection accessible to all, social dialogue, the respect for fundamental social rights including core labour standards, minimum standards for working conditions and for ensuring workers upstream involvement in managing change  all these play a crucial role.  The European Commission promotes core labour rights in EU trade policy. Core labour standards are defined by the ILO to include Convention No  100  on equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, and Convention No  111  on discrimination in the workplace.  In the multilateral context, a reference to core labour standards was included in the declaration of the first World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Singapore in  1996 . Regrettably, WTO members did not agree to include this issue as part of the Doha Development Agenda. Nevertheless, the Commission is committed to addressing trade and social development, core labour standards and commitment to meaningful dialogue between the WTO and the International Labour Organization, both in the EUs own trade policy review and the trade policy reviews of other countries.  As part of this process, the International Convention of Free Trade Unions reports on core labour standards are prepared ahead of each trade policy review. The Commission is also strongly in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO. The European Commission has also pursued social development objectives in regional, biregional and bilateral arrangements. All its most recent agreements recognise and promote social rights as part of the universal objective of decent work for all.  The Commission has, for example, entered into dialogue and cooperation with countries such as Chile, South Africa and biregionally with the ACP countries, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Mercosur and other regions. The European Commission remains of the view that the discussion and pursuit of social issues should not be used for protectionist purposes and it rejects any unilateral sanctionsbased approach. The objective is to further social progress with a view to promoting benefits for all.  Since  1998  the EC has also been granting trade preferences under the Generalised System of Preferences, special incentive arrangements to those developing countries that assure the respect of the core labour rights as defined by the ILO and comply with international recognised standards on sustainable forest management. Currently, some  180  developing countries and dependent territories are granted GSP. In the framework of the new GSP scheme, adopted on  27  June  2005  by the Council, a GSPplus initiative for sustainable development provides additional tariff preferences for countries that have signed and effectively implemented UN and ILO conventions on human rights and labour rights, including those on gender equality. A total of  15  countries have ratified the core conventions and received GSPplus status.  A gender helpdesk currently operates under the RELEX family of the Commission. The services of the gender helpdesk are part of a larger effort to build capacity and knowledge to promote gender equality and fully implement the strategy of gender mainstreaming. A tool kit has also been published to give practical help to Commission staff on how to mainstream gender issues.  The EC is also developing a close relationship with the International Labour Organization on traderelated matters aimed at promoting core labour standards through assessment, capacitybuilding and enforcement in developing countries. In  20052006  the Commission has been funding an ILO pilot project aiming to develop decent work indicators in developing countries for examining the relationship between decent work and trade liberalisation. Case studies have been undertaken in the Philippines and Uganda. The data gathered include disaggregated statistics on employment, wages and working hours for women and men. These data provide a more sophisticated picture of decent work than previously available. The Commission will explore the potential to use these indicators in future aid programmes with developing countries to help them manage social adjustment to globalisation, and the report will be submitted to the European Parliament.  The European Commission will also look into the potential for using decent work indicators as part of trade sustainability impact assessments.
4406598 author: Alastair Smith:  Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Guerreiro, for his report, and the Fisheries Committee for having taken up this important subject in the form of an owninitiative report. It brings a significant contribution to the ongoing debate on the economic situation of the European Union fishing sector.  I also noted with satisfaction that the Conference of Committee Chairmen expressed its appreciation of the Commissions communication on the economic difficulties of the sector. The Conference of Committee Chairmen welcomed the positions expressed by the Commission in its communication, in which it envisages a number of possibilities for aiding the sector in the short term, in the existing context of Community legislation on State aids; in particular, our willingness to examine the national rescue and restructuring aid schemes, submitted by Member States in the two years following publication of the communication. I shall therefore also touch upon some of the recommendations of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, which converge largely with those of the report we are discussing.  We share the same concerns and objectives regarding the fishing sector. We agree with many of the proposals and assessments contained in your report, although we have different views and perspectives on some others regarding, for instance, the shortterm support to be given to the sector.  Let me state from the beginning that I strongly disagree with the statement that the Commission appears to take advantage of the current economic crisis to reduce the size of the fishing fleet. By calling a spade a spade, by highlighting the state that the Community fishery is in because of years of overfishing, we are not taking advantage of anything. I also find unfair the suggestion that we have done too little, too late.  The imbalance between fleet capacity and available resources and the oil price increase are objective causes of the current difficulties faced by the sector. The Commission has done everything possible to help the sector, taking into account the parameters of Community legislation and the need to ensure that the aid actually contributes to fishing sustainability.  No mandatory capacity reductions are foreseen under Community law. Indeed, our challenge has been to balance the necessity to help the segments most affected by high oil prices with the need to address longterm structural problems. We have, therefore, sought to design instruments to rescue and restructure fishing enterprises in difficulty, to help them adapt and become profitable within the context of high oil prices.  It is no use giving aid to fishing enterprises in difficulty if they do not, or cannot, undertake the restructuring that will make them profitable again. For that reason, we have excluded from the rescue schemes all forms of operating aid, which apart from going against Community legislation, will only prolong the problem without solving it.  Action can be taken in the short term by Member States willing to provide support for financial and physical restructuring of fishing enterprises in difficulty, in the framework of national rescue and restructuring schemes. That is precisely meant to allow fishing enterprises in difficulty to obtain loan capital and bail them out, as requested both in your report and in that of the Conference of Committee Chairmen on the work programme of the Commission.  The Community is strongly committed to these rescue and restructuring schemes, since Community funds will be available mainly through the European Fisheries Fund, to cofinance the restructuring of fishing enterprises, as well as to alleviate their social consequences. Socioeconomic support can indeed be provided through the EFF, as requested in your report. The new EFF will also provide for more advantageous conditions for scrapping vessels, which was a concern expressed both in your report and that of the Conference of Committee Chairmen.  Besides EFF support, we have worked hard to establish new rules for aid, in collaboration with the Commissions other services, in order to facilitate the handling of small State aid schemes by Member States. This goes in the direction of your request, which point was also made by the Conference of Committee Chairmen. You must appreciate that our proposal already represents a tenfold increase on the former threshold, which was fixed less than two years ago.  We have also noted the request for a specific treatment of the longdistance fleet, expressed both in your report and that of the Committee Chairmen. We are prepared to consider if, and under what conditions, a special register for this segment of the fleet would be justified.  Beyond the rescue and restructuring of fishing firms in difficulty, we must create in the long term an environment that is conducive to their sustainable success. The communication therefore highlights some policy areas that I want to develop in the coming years to create this more favourable environment. I am not going to repeat them here, but I would like to highlight some areas where our views converge.  We fully agree on the need to better involve fishermen in the management of fisheries. That is crucial for the success of the reformed common fisheries policy and I am determined to move in that direction. Due attention will also be paid to the financing of regional advisory councils operation.  In line with your recommendations, we have taken serious steps to strengthen the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) at international level. Our  2002  action plan is being updated and a new piece of legislation is being considered. That has been given high priority in our agenda. We share the view that smallscale coastal fishing has specificities that deserve to be taken into account. We have done it extensively, both in the rescue and restructuring schemes and in the EFF. We have launched a study to assess objectively whether more can be done. We also agree with you that special attention needs to be paid to marketing, with a view to increasing the added value of fishing products for fishermen.  As mentioned also by the Conference of Committee Chairmen, research should also be pursued in the Seventh Framework Programme to help address some of the most important challenges of the sector.  In conclusion, I would like to thank you once again for your contributions and interest. They demonstrate how much we all strive to ensure a sustainable and healthy future for the fishing sector. I am looking forward to a fruitful discussion with you.
4874718 author: Marc Jones:  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for the various points they have raised. I will try to respond to some of them.  Firstly, with regard to the need for a guarantee fund, the basic problem with guarantee funding is that it can amount to operating aid, which is not permissible under competition rules. We are looking further into this and welcome any proposals from Member States on how such funds may be operated in accordance with competition rules. The Commission could approve such schemes at national level if they guaranteed reimbursement of all public aid under commercial conditions.  As regards the longterm aim to help the industry adapt to high fuel prices, the Commission places a high priority on research and development for more fuelefficient and more environmentally friendly fishing techniques. Significant funds are being provided to support such work under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research. Renewable energy, in particular biofuels, represents one such measure.  Research on the design of new, more selective or more fuelefficient fishing gear is encouraged and can be funded under the framework programme, with initial acquisition of such equipment also financeable under the European Fisheries Fund.  The European Fisheries Fund, agreed to last June, provides for engine renewals and, in this regard, smallscale vessels are treated more favourably. In fact, regarding smallscale coastal fisheries, we have catered for specificities in the rescue and restructuring scheme and in the European Fisheries Fund. One example is the acquisition of new engines or engine renewal. We are studying what else can be done in order to help smallscale coastal fisheries.  Regarding the comment by Mr Allister and others that the Commission is taking advantage of the increase in fuel prices to reduce the fleet, let me repeat the facts as I know them. There have been years on end of overfishing and this has caused falling catches. This means a vast overcapacity today: we have vessels with a capacity vastly exceeding what can sustainably be caught. Those are the facts. The vast majority of stocks are being fished in a completely unsustainable manner.  Acknowledging this will help us find solutions for the longterm benefit of future fishermen. If we continue to bury our heads in the sand, we will only prolong the agony before fisheries die a natural death through continued overfishing.  We agree that special attention needs to be paid to marketing with a view to increasing the added value of fishery products for fishermen. We are actively looking at this and the renewal of the common organisation of the market should answer the sectors concerns in this area, in particular by helping the sector to improve firstsale prices.  The ceiling of  30000  proposed by the Commission is a balanced and reasonable compromise. The Commission has proposed raising the ceiling from the previous amount of  3000  to  30000 . The review of this threshold has been carried out in the light of the specific characteristics of fishing enterprises, independently of the sectors current difficulties.  It was commented that the Commission was proposing too little too late. I acknowledge that the communication was issued later than desired, but one has to appreciate the complexity of the situation we are dealing with and the constraints of Community legislation, in particular regarding competition rules. This is why it was important to describe carefully the rules and conditions necessary for designing rescue and restructuring schemes.  Many fishing enterprises will benefit from the measures proposed if Member States take up the challenge and prepare the necessary framework swiftly. These measures are substantial: financial restructuring, renewal of engines and of fishing gear and aid to temporary cessation. According to the guidelines, state aid for the rescue and restructuring of SMEs in the area of fisheries can cover up to  75  of the total cost of a rescue and restructuring plan.  May I suggest that we work together and do our utmost to make the best use of these possibilities.
1697223 author: Katarina Reid:  . Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries for the preparation of this report concerning the Commissions proposal for a longterm plan for the management of plaice and sole fisheries.  This is an important topic. Since the Commission first began discussing the longterm management of these stocks and fisheries in  2004 , there has been a significant worsening of the state of these stocks. In particular, the size of the sole stock is now declining rapidly due to low numbers of incoming young fish. High fuel prices and lower catch rates have combined to create a very difficult situation for this sector and this fits very well into what I have been saying before.  The Commissions proposal is intended to reverse this trend by leading to more efficient and more profitable fisheries and I am keen to see it adopted soon so that fisheries can begin to recover and to improve.  I thank you, therefore, for this report and I now turn to the specific amendments that you propose. I can support Amendments  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  18  and  21 . However, I should mention that the Commission has already begun a debate, as requested in Amendment  4 , with the regional advisory councils concerning the implementation of maximum sustainable yield management and has also already arranged for the impact assessment foreseen in Amendment  5 . The final text should reflect the fact that these measures requested by Parliament have already taken place.  I can accept in principle that there could be a twostep approach in longterm plans, and that different measures would apply in situations where stocks are outside safe biological limits from those applicable in situations where stocks are within those limits. Therefore, I can accept the principles behind Amendments  1 ,  7 ,  9  and  10 . However, it is important to improve the state of the stock and the finances of the industry. More consultations with the sector and the Member States concerned will be needed to refine the details, as will careful consideration of the results of the impact analysis.  I fully support provisions to revise longterm targets at periodic intervals of about five years in order to take account of changes in the environment and the ecosystems. However, I am not in a position to accept Parliaments amendments intended to provide stability for the industry by setting TACs that are stable for threeyear periods. Stability for the industry can better be provided by limiting changes to TACs between years. The North Sea RAC has revised its opinion on this topic and in its latest advice no longer advises such a measure. Therefore, I cannot accept Amendment  8 , the second paragraph of Amendment  9 , nor Amendments  10 ,  11  and  24 .  Concerning Amendment  12 , I can accept the widening of scope to include a wider definition of fishing effort for plaice and sole, though a more precise legal wording may be necessary. However, here again, I cannot support a proposal that effort limits be adapted only at threeyearly intervals.  Concerning Amendment  13 , a legislative text for a longterm plan must define clearly how efforts should be adjusted in order to achieve the targets of the plan. Parliaments text does not seem clear enough from a legal and technical point of view. Advice from scientific committees indicates that significant amounts of cod are caught and are discarded.  As the plaice and sole fisheries exert mortality on cod, it is necessary to keep this mortality under review and to adjust relevant efforts if necessary. This is why I am not in a position to accept Amendment  14 , because it would create a nonequitable situation in comparison with other fisheries sectors that also have an impact on cod and are subject to codrecovery measures.  Amendment  15  asks for a change in the logbook tolerance from  8  to  10 . However, the  8  figure was adopted in the Council as a common value in other longterm plans after a long discussion. I believe this figure should be retained for plaice and sole as for the other longterm plans.  The practical implementation of Amendments  16  or  17  would require that fisheries inspectors be able to distinguish between plaice or sole caught in the North Sea and fish of these species caught in other areas, a task which does not seem possible.  I can accept the principle and intentions behind Amendments  6 ,  19 ,  22  and  23 , but I believe it should be implemented in a different way. The Commission is preparing an evaluation of technical measures and the regulation of fishing gears should be reviewed as soon as possible in that context.  If either plaice or sole enters into biologically very highrisk situations, the Council should be more cautious in setting fishing opportunities. This is consistent with the guiding principles of the common fisheries policy and will provide additional protection to stocks that are in their most vulnerable state. For this reason, I cannot accept Amendment  20 .  In conclusion, I thank Parliament for its careful scrutiny of this document. Raising and addressing the issues I have just mentioned will, I am sure, improve the quality and efficiency of the regulation that is eventually agreed in order to achieve the objective of improving the profitability of the fishery and the state of the stocks of plaice and sole, as well as reducing discarding.
1912 author: Alastair Whittacker:  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Migulez Ramos and the Fisheries Committee for the opinion on the Commission report on the operation of the socalled Shark Finning Regulation. I am pleased to note that the rapporteur praises the clarity and conciseness of the Commissions report and shares the view that this regulation is achieving its objective. Let me assure you that the Commission is committed to monitoring the application of this regulation to ensure its proper implementation, including of Member States obligations regarding control and reporting.  The Commission will also continue to promote the prohibition of shark finning in international forums. In addition, the Commission will continue in its endeavours towards the adoption of measures based on scientific information and other considerations within Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.  I would also recall that the prohibition of shark finning practices is not the only way to ensure a sustainable fishery for these species. A more comprehensive set of management measures is required. We have already taken some measures in this respect. I refer, in particular, to special efforts to improve scientific knowledge and data collection, to establish catch or effort limits for certain species, including deepsea species, to prohibit drift nets that may catch some large pelagic sharks and to control and limit fishing capacity.  As rightly pointed out in Parliaments motion for a resolution, the Commission has identified numerous actions to halt the loss of biodiversity by  2010  and beyond, including Community plans of action for sharks and sea birds.  My department is currently looking into the request for the presentation of a Community plan of action by mid 2007 . While it is too early to have a clear overview of the detailed work programme for  2007 , it is clear that a formal, complete and detailed plan of action requires a comprehensive assessment of the situation and of the possible measures, together with an early consultation of all interested parties, which will take time and resources. The desired timeframe seems rather too ambitious, and setting too short a timeframe for preparation and consultation could even be counterproductive. I would prefer to be less prescriptive in terms of deadlines. However, I can assure honourable Members that my department will undertake to complete the plan of action at the earliest possible date.  Returning to the reports core concerns, I have taken good note of the proposed calls for the Commission to present amendments to the Shark Finning Regulation, especially with a view to reviewing the  5  fin weight versus live body weight ratio on the basis of a speciesdependent approach, and to revise the possibilities for separate landings of fins and carcasses, as well as to report again on the operation of this regulation within two years.  When deciding on this regulation, the Council did not consider it appropriate to adopt a speciesspecific approach regarding the fin to body weight ratio. I think the reasons mentioned in the debate then are still valid now. A single  5  fin to live body weight ratio applicable to the whole sharkcatch of a vessel is a realistic, feasible, controllable, simple and proportionate method of preventing shark finning practices from spreading. The Commissions report also confirms this.  I am not, therefore, of the opinion that amendments to the regulation should be proposed at this stage. Firstly, because the regulation was only recently adopted and is working well overall. Secondly, because the Commission believes it would be unwieldy to start revising the fin to body weight ratio or introducing some speciesspecific approach to the Shark Finning Regulation without new measures to ensure sustainable shark fishing.  The much broader exercise of preparing a Community plan of action for sharks will necessarily include a reassessment of developments under the Shark Finning Regulation and its possible need for review, especially on the basis of the national annual reports, which are available for all those interested. It is at this point, therefore, that we will be able to consider once more the situation with respect to bodyfin ratio and make any recommendations accordingly.  Parliaments necessary full involvement in a proposal for a plan of action will also provide another opportunity for Parliament to be informed about and to play a role in developments on shark finning matters. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation. You can rest assured that I am always ready to act and to present all supporting evidence if new information becomes available indicating significant changes in the situation. I am committed to advances in the area of shark conservation and other aspects of marine biodiversity, and will inform you in due time of the progress made.
2500061 author: Mary Corless:  Mr President, I am here today to talk about the big issue of small technologies. Over  2000  years ago, the ancient Greek politician Demosthenes said: Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises. I believe he was right. And I mean enterprise in every sense of the word  not just as a business, but as a project and a voyage of discovery.  Nanotechnology has already shown that it holds a lot of promise. It not only offers new solutions to many current problems, but also opens up new innovation opportunities, boosting the economy and creating jobs.  Nanotechnology is already making a difference in many areas. For example, new medical treatments are being developed for severe diseases such as brain tumours and Alzheimers disease; it is helping the environment through more efficient catalysts, better batteries and more efficient light sources; and smaller, lighter and betterperforming materials, components and systems are being created. But nanotechnology could also make a huge contribution to major global challenges such as how to tackle threats to the environment, how to make better use of resources and create less waste, and how to improve energy generation technologies.  Europe is in a leading position in the world today, partly thanks to the Commissions framework programme. European industry should now reap the benefits of that knowledge through innovative products and processes. But to follow through, we need to take action on several fronts, which are outlined in the Commissions communication Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies: An Action Plan for Europe  200509 . These include the need to increase investment, boost interdisciplinarity, create necessary infrastructures, expand human resources and foster innovation.  Much progress has already been made in implementing the action plan: Commission funding for research in nanosciences and nanotechnologies has steadily increased to about EUR  470  million in  2005 . In fact, the Commission has now become the worlds largest single public funding agency for nanotechnology. It accounted for  30  of public funding of nanotechnology research in the European Union last year. Significant funding increases are expected over the duration of the Seventh Framework Programme. The Commission has proposed expanding funding for nanotechnology, with a new emphasis on developing infrastructures and projects assessing the risk of nanotechnology for humans and the environment. That is a key area, because, as well as the benefits, we must also recognise the potential risks. These must be carefully assessed. Some concerns have already been raised about new applications.  The action plan addresses these too. Special projects and publicity in many languages will provide information and communication. There are projects to engage the public  presenting both sides of the argument; brochures explaining how nanotechnology works; and even DVDs explaining the issues in simple terms for children. In addition, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies is working on an opinion on the ethics of nanomedicine, which we expect to be delivered to President Barroso soon.  The Commission is committed to ensuring a balanced approach. What is fundamental is to have a high level of public health, safety, environmental and consumer protection. To do that, in Europe we need to identify the safety concerns, collect data for a health and environmental impact assessment of the product, and act at the earliest possible stage through adjustments, where necessary, of risk assessment procedures for nanotechnology.  The Commission is also looking at the European legislation applicable to nanotechnology. We are assessing how adequate and appropriate that legislation is to deal with the increasing use of nanotechnologies. We also need to consider potential regulatory issues.  Lastly, we are active in many international fora, addressing new issues and seeking to develop a code of good conduct.  I am very happy to note that the European Parliament, through the report of Mr Ransdorf, fully recognises the important role to be played by nanosciences and nanotechnologies and welcomes the Commissions action plan. I find it very positive that the report calls for increased public investment in related research and development, particularly in developing relevant infrastructures and nanomedicine. It is equally important that it stresses the importance of creating the right climate for innovation in Europe as well as emphasising the importance of speaking with one voice internationally in this highly promising research area. I am very happy to note that the report has enjoyed a very large measure of support from the three parliamentary committees that have discussed it.  To conclude, I hope I have given you a brief outline of the Commissions balanced and growing nanosciences and nanotechnologies policy. Together, we can all benefit from that exciting new enterprise. I thank the European Parliament for its support so far and hope you will continue to support the Commission in further developing the European dimension of nanoscience and research.
7487924 author: Philip Brown:  . Mr President, I should like, in a telegraphic way, to respond to and summarise what I think is the message from todays debate concerning innovation, funding, risks, ethics and the regulatory framework. I shall take them one by one.  On innovation, there is no doubt that nanosciences and nanotechnologies have a very high potential. Nanosciences are very much like information technology. So a breakthrough in this area would provide results for all sectors. That is why it is very important to pay close attention to innovation.  If we were to compare ourselves to the United States, we would find that in many areas we are not lagging behind. However, the one area in which we are truly lagging behind is information technology. If you look at how much money we provide for innovation, research and development, you would find that even structurally, not just globally, we are lagging behind. We should not make the same mistake when it comes to innovation.  We are trying to engage European technology platforms, joint technology initiatives  in which we are very active  and the companies from that area. I agree that the intellectual property issue, IPR, is also important and that is why it has received special attention in the action plan.  Let me now turn to funding. We have two themes which are dealing with that very seriously. One is, of course, nanosciences and nanotechnologies and the other is information and communication technologies. However, there is more than that. There are also the questions that will be dealt with in the European Research Council, in the people programme, in the capacities programme, and in infrastructure  the things connected with regional development. So it is very hard to compare the money that was devoted today to FP 6  with the money that will be used in FP 7 . What I can tell you is that the funding will be increased considerably in comparison with the existing situation.  Again, if we compare the funding in Europe to that in the United States, we must not forget that the framework programme is  5  of European public funding. Therefore, it is obvious, if you compare how much public funding is provided for nanosciences, that it is  30  of that public funding in Europe. Obviously, we are giving it proportionally much higher attention than the Member States are doing. That has to be clearly underlined.  Secondly, in normal circumstances, two thirds of funding should come from the private sector, where we have to focus our attention. So here one of the things we found out  and it was published in August  2006   was what the decisive elements are according to the companies doing the research in the area of Europe: first, the existence of the market; and second, the knowledge pool, not the wage level. The wage level is almost irrelevant when we talk about knowledge and research and development. These are the areas which need attention.  Thirdly, concerning the risks, it is true that we do not know everything and it would be hypocritical to say that we do, because it is not true. However, we know a lot, and I agree with all those who said that we need to pay proper attention to that in FP 7 . In the action plan we have also paid proper attention to the questions connected with the risks. Informal collection of inputs for further projects under FP 7  has recently been completed. It is also extremely important that the way in which we approach questions of risk should be transparent and that we educate people in the proper way.  Concerning ethics, it is quite clear that we have to maintain the high ethical standards and principles that we have always followed and pay proper attention to that.  Finally, on the regulatory framework, regulatory issues again form an integral part of the action plan. They are concentrated there and the Commission is working in close collaboration with research DGs and DGs active in regulatory aspects, and with external experts, with a view to addressing various uncertainties with regard to potential hazards and exposure, to addressing gaps in knowledge, and to further developing guidelines and methods. The adequacy of existing and future legislation with regard to nanotechnology products is also being examined carefully.  To summarise, without any doubt we need a balanced approach, which is transparent, with a high level of care for public health, safety, the environment and consumer protection, but aimed at exploiting the huge potential of nanosciences and nanotechnologies in research and innovation. Todays report was a very good opportunity to underline all these components of our approach and I should like to thank honourable Members for their attention to these issues, for the support given to our work and for the concerns they have raised.
888073 author: Helen Finlayson:  . Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague, MrMichel, who is unable to be here this morning. I wish to begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, MrHutchinson, and the Committee on Development for a constructive report on aid effectiveness, a topic of key importance for the EU development policy.  Improving both the quantity and the quality of our aid is certainly one of the core commitments set out in the European Consensus for Development, the latter having been endorsed by all Member States, the Commission and Parliament in  2005 . The Consensus is a crucial document for all of us. First, it opens a new dimension for joint work between the  25  Member States and the Commission. Secondly, it highlights, for the first time in EU history, our collective European vision, principles and objectives that govern our development policy. Thirdly, it sets out the comparative advantage of the Commission and the objective of redeploying Member States activities in order to achieve better and highly necessary synergy.  As demonstrated during all the debates on the European Consensus, the Commission should promote the impact of Europe in development and push the European aid effectiveness agenda. The European Union must be a leading force in international fora dealing with aid effectiveness, in particular in the OECDDAC, where the Commission enjoys full statutory membership. A strong EU makes for a strong DAC.  It is with this in mind that Commissioner Michel has proposed a package of concrete deliverables on aid effectiveness, which were endorsed by the Council in spring  2006 . The Commissions approach to aid effectiveness is based on lessons learnt from the field, good practices and expectations from the partner countries. It is rooted in the principles of harmonisation, ownership, alignment and management by results, as in the Paris Declaration.  Parliament has made it clear in previous resolutions and again in this report that it supports the Commission in its efforts to strengthen the coordination and coherence of both Commission and EU actions in the development field. The report highlights three important areas in which progress needs to be achieved in  2007  and I would like to comment on them briefly.  First, strengthening complementarity and the division of labour: these issues are crucial for the Commission. The EU Donor Atlas has indeed underlined the gaps and duplications in donor activities which hamper the impact of aid. In order to address these weaknesses, the Commission launched a process with Member States aimed at adopting operational principles for a better division of labour between EU donors. Discussions are currently ongoing and this initiative should be rendered operational with Council conclusions in  2007 .  Second, the joint programming of aid: the EU now has at its disposal a joint framework adopted last spring. This framework foresees the drawingup of common diagnostics and analysis in partner countries, in close partnership with Member States involved, to establish common operational solutions. Partner countries and civil society play a major and active role in this process. Far from being excluded from these discussions, civil society is strongly involved in the country diagnostic set up in order to ensure its full ownership. This approach is fully in line with the approach used in EC programming.  Thirdly, a few words on an essential tool for improving the division of labour and coordination, that is, cofinancing. In  2007 , the Commission will bring forward specific proposals on how to strengthen the use of cofinancing as a tool to support the division of labour amongst donors, as well as to assist those Member States building their development capacities. Parliament has been persistent in its wellfounded requests to the Commission to ensure coordination among Member States in order to strengthen the effectiveness of financing for development. As you can see, the Commission has clearly adopted a proactive attitude and will, in close collaboration with Member States, use all tools at its disposal to make greater aid effectiveness a reality. I can only advocate that the European Parliament uses the joint meeting on development with the national parliaments next October as an opportunity to expand support for these initiatives.  Indeed, it is important for the EU to ensure that its political ambitions match its financial status as the largest global donor. In this respect, Parliament has a crucial role to play in helping Member States to accelerate their reforms and make the necessary cultural changes implied by this new joint working dimension. Success on this front is of major importance for reaching our development goals, as well as taking the lead on the global development agenda.  Let us recall that the ultimate objective is to succeed in the fight against poverty. It is only by acting together and by making the best possible use of all the means at our disposal that success can be guaranteed. Thanks to the European Consensus, we now have all the necessary tools to achieve this goal. We must make sure that these commitments remain high on our political agenda and that we do not miss this real opportunity to turn our ambitious political commitments into reality. It goes beyond politics; it is a matter of collective credibility.
454730 author: Philip Finlayson:  . Mr President, intellectual property rights (IPR) are at the heart of a knowledgebased economy. Innovation is the key to Europes prospects of becoming more competitive on a global level. Protection of intellectual property is of crucial importance, because IPR not only rewards investment in new products and services but also ensures the transfer of technology stimulating further innovation. The recent consultation on the future of the patent system in Europe delivered one simple message: the legal framework should offer an affordable patent protection for all businesses, small and big, ensure legal certainty and be applied for the benefit of all players. A solid legal framework is therefore essential. I must repeat that we need to keep up. Compared to our major trading partners, Europe is losing ground.  The Community patent remains blocked in the Council, but recognising the economic importance of patents, I felt that it was not a good thing to leave the entire patent agenda in limbo. So, earlier this year, as you know, I launched a broad consultation of all interested parties on future patent policy in Europe.  The consultation has shown that industry favours the Commissions effort to simplify the patent system in Europe and to make it more costeffective. There are two major issues here: languages, or translation costs, on the one hand and the jurisdictional system on the other. There is strong support for the introduction of a Community patent. However, industry is not enamoured of the political compromise reached in the Council in  2003  on the Community patent. It rejects the proposed solutions on both language and the jurisdictional system because they do not achieve the cost reductions and simplification of the patent system that industry is calling for.  At the same time, there is also a strong call for the improvement of the existing European patent system, established by the Munich Convention, by the successful conclusion of a European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) on jurisdiction, and by the ratification and entry into force of the London Agreement on language arrangements.  It is interesting to note that no single initiative for the improvement of the EU patent system has received unanimous support from stakeholders. Different stakeholders highlight different aspects, and many suggest that a package of different measures is needed, which should be implemented in parallel.  I am therefore convinced that we need to take a multifaceted approach. In order to succeed, we should tackle all the patent issues in one package. That package will have to respond to stakeholders criticism and needs. We will only succeed if we can demonstrate that what we propose will have added value compared to the status quo in particular, regarding costs of patenting (translation costs) and legal certainty (jurisdictional system). We are currently working on the options for the way forward and will present them in a communication and action plan, which the Commission should adopt before the end of this year.  A key component of this work concerns the jurisdictional issue. At present, although business has a onestop shop where it can acquire a patent (the EPO), it may find itself defending the patent on several fronts at once. That is because the patents granted by the European Patent Office are in fact a bundle of national patents and can only be enforced by national courts. The possibility of multiforum litigation concerning the same invention naturally adds cost, but even more importantly it creates uncertainty, as different courts in different countries can deliver diverging interpretations on the same patented invention. We need to tackle that issue as a matter of urgency. The current patchwork may prevent patent holders from being able to enforce their rights and it discourages candidates, in particular SMEs looking for efficient and affordable patent protection, from using the European patent. Europe is, at present, unable to offer innovative businesses an optimal solution when it comes to protecting their intellectual property. We cannot aspire to be the most competitive economy in the world if we do not find workable solutions for patent application and protection.  The Community patent and the initiatives to improve the European patent, that is, the London Agreement on translations and the EPLA, are not mutually exclusive. They both aim for the same goal: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system. That is why I want to pursue both. We face similar challenges in designing the jurisdictional arrangements for the Community patent: we need to find a unified system that provides judicial independence and gives clarity and reliability to patent users while avoiding both overcentralisation and fragmentation.  In order to achieve that objective, the Community needs to get involved in the EPLA, which addresses shared responsibilities between Member States and the Community. It goes without saying that Parliament will have to contribute when the Community proceeds with the required proposals, in order to take this issue forward in the near future.  I am aware of some critical voices against the EPLA. Let me just say that I see the EPLA as a practical initiative to bring greater unity to the case law on patents in Europe. And legal certainty is what our industry, big and small alike, need. There are hundreds of thousands of patents granted by the EPO. Even if we had a Community patent, there would be a need to streamline the jurisdiction process for EPOgranted patents.  It is up to us to get involved in this initiative to ensure that it serves the competitiveness of our economy. I recognise that there are legitimate doubts and concerns: the cost of litigation under the EPLA, the impact of the rules of procedure, which we have yet to see, and the independence of the EPLA judges from the EPO. But I am convinced that the best way to confront these problems is by engaging actively with the process and by securing an outcome that is satisfactory and fair to all concerned and in full conformity with EU law.  Of course, neither the Community patent nor the EPLA are a panacea. There will always be businesses  the smaller ones  that prefer to deal with their national patent offices, or to use business models that do not rely on patents. We need to look at ways in which we can help and support them. And, of course, we need to ensure that large companies do not abuse their position, either by unfairly exploiting their own patents or by unfairly ignoring the patent rights of others.  The consultation threw up many such issues, for example, the possible mediation mechanisms that could precede litigation, the need to create technology markets that would enable businesses to trade their IPR more successfully, and the idea of exchanging best practice between national patent offices, especially in terms of the special needs of SMEs. I will be responding to all these issues, in cooperation with my colleagues in the Commission, and therefore intend to propose a comprehensive strategy.  Faced with a  21 stcentury global and knowledgebased economy, we urgently need to find a solution to the patent issue. I count upon Parliaments support in finding a comprehensive solution to these rather complex issues.
3095274 author: Nancy Finlayson:  Mr President, at the conclusion of this debate, there is a point which I think we have to underline. Not a single Member of the European Parliament has spoken out against condemnation of North Koreas behaviour. I think that is a very important conclusion to this important debate.  There may be some doubts about what to do next and how to deal with North Korea in the future, but the fact that the test has been a source of concern for the international community  and that the international community has taken responsibility for addressing the issue  has been supported by all the Members who have spoken in this debate. I think we should be happy about that, because on issues of this nature and of this degree of importance, the responsibilities of Members of the European Parliament are on a par with those of the members of the international community.  There are different conclusions we can draw as to why the test was carried out and what the consequences are for the future. Some of us have been to North Korea. I have been there and talked to the countrys leader on several occasions. In Kuala Lumpur in July, I had the opportunity to talk with the Foreign Minister and he told me then that there was to be no return to the sixparty talks. So it was almost certain by then that something of this nature might happen.  We have to praise the Chinese, who have been leading the sixparty talks and standing their ground. This time, however, they unfortunately failed to convince North Korea, and instead of a meeting, a nuclear test has taken place.  I agree completely with those who have said that the NonProliferation Treaty should be reviewed. Mrs Napoletano made that point most coherently and vehemently. I share her concern about the fact that the last revision of the NonProliferation Treaty was a failure. It was a failure on the part of everybody involved in the revision, including the nuclear powers, some of which are Member States of the European Union.  The NonProliferation Treaty dates back to  1968 . We have gone through five revisions already and none of them has been able to address the difficulties and loopholes involved in that Treaty. That must be said. Let us also point out, however, that North Korea is not a signatory to the NonProliferation Treaty. It abandoned the NonProliferation Treaty in  2003 , and therefore is under no obligation to comply with it. It abandoned the NonProliferation Treaty because it did not want to admit inspectors, which is something that is mandatory under the NonProliferation Treaty.  As we are seeing today, and as we will see in the future, the NonProliferation Treaty needs to be revised and updated. As I said, the Treaty was drawn up in  1968 . That is a long time ago in historical terms, and therefore we have to make an effort. The Europeans can plead that these regimes be adapted to the realities of today and not to the realities of yesterday. I quite agree with that.  As far as sanctions are concerned, I do not think that the Security Council can just make a statement. The Security Council has to act, otherwise other countries that are watching to see how the Security Council responds will draw the conclusion that the international community does not take an act of this nature seriously. Remember what happened when Pakistan did it? North Korea was watching for the international communitys response to Pakistans actions. And probably part of todays situation is a reflection of what happened then.  That does not mean, of course, that any sanctions must target the people of North Korea, who have already suffered a great deal. They suffer politically, they suffer economically, they suffer in their daily lives. Therefore, other things have to be put in place and taken into account. I think the most important kinds of sanctions that should be put in place are sanctions which prevent proliferation by North Korea and prevent North Korea from passing nuclear technology on to other states which might be looking to acquire such technology so that they too can move in the same direction. This is probably the most important step that the United Nations Security Council can take.  As far as diplomacy is concerned, everybody in this House will agree that diplomacy is what we like to do. We Europeans like to solve complex, difficult problems with what we value most: our minds, our intelligence, our diplomacy. And there is no doubt that this problem is indeed complex and difficult.
2106328 author: Amy Whittacker:  Mr President, first of all let me welcome the broad support that was given for the agenda for innovation, for a European institute of technology, for a common energy policy and for a European immigration policy. But let me tell you that we need to deliver that message outside this room, because, as some of you said, there are still some misunderstandings.  Let me just mention the EIT. It is interesting that everybody agrees that in Europe we are not doing enough in terms of innovation; there are not enough links between the universities and the research centres and the world of the economy, business and practical projects. But when an idea comes to change that situation, immediately there is resistance. It is amazing! Everybody then says, but we have excellent universities!  of course we have excellent universities! But if we have excellent universities, why are we falling behind the Americans and others? Something is wrong. The status quo is not an option. We cannot go on with business as usual.  I know we have excellent universities. Universities were created in Europe. They are a European creation, but we are not taking advantage of the full benefits or the full potential of our European dimension. Let us be frank: some of our universities are still very corporatist, very closed. We need a European dimension. Even the biggest Member States lack the dimension to promote the global culture we need now to face the challenges of this  21 st century. Therefore, the idea is networkbased. It is not a huge bureaucratic institution; it is networkbased, building on the principles of excellence, on what all excellent universities and excellent research centres are doing, but with a view to connecting businesses with research so that we can promote innovation.  At the Commission I met with the leaders of the most important European companies that are driving research in the world. I got great support for the idea and I could name some of the companies. Two of those leaders in European business came from the United States, and they told me at the meeting that their biggest shock when they came to Europe was to discover that, unlike in the United States where they have American institutions for the whole of America, in Europe we do not have that. Only now are we starting with the European Research Council. So we have great institutions to promote research in Germany, Britain, France and Sweden. We have great things, but we are missing a European dimension. We are missing a European mission to give them the real tools they need to compete with the best. That is why I believe this is a great idea. I hope that, not only will it be supported in general, but that it will be supported when we come forward with practical proposals. That is why I hope to have your support when we come forward next week with a practical proposal on the EIT, and I hope for your support when in January we come forward with a really ambitious energy package.  My final point concerns coherence. The best way to negotiate with Russia is from a coherent and unified position. If we want to be credible when we discuss matters with Russia or other partners, we have to show them that we are able to have a coherent policy ourselves. We cannot discuss energy with them in a serious manner if we have  25  different energy policies. It would not be credible, lets face it.  The first thing to do if we want to be seen from outside as credible, is to put our own house in order and to have a real joint approach to energy. The same, of course, applies to other issues. But I strongly agree that the fight against climate change is a crucial element in our energy policy and we should recall that the European Union is a key player in that field. We are, in fact, leading in the world. I can tell you that when we discuss this matter with our American friends, with our Russian partners, or with the Chinese or Indians, we always put this question at the forefront of our negotiations. It is important to do what we can, but also to involve others in those efforts. But what all these issues show  from innovation to immigration, to energy, to the fight against climate change  is a strong argument for Europe. In the age of globalisation, even the biggest Member States do not have the means to tackle those challenges. So if you want a strong Europe, we are going in the right direction. A strong Europe is not bureaucratic, but has a common approach to those issues.  We should also speak with one voice on human rights, and I hope that this is the message which comes out from Lahti: the European leaders may come from different political and ideological backgrounds, from different national situations, but they are ready to build a strong Europe together and they are ready to speak with one voice to the outside world. That is what I am hoping for from Lahti.
7161663 author: James Green:  Member of the Commission. Madam President, I should like to thank Parliament for having organised this debate on breast cancer. The very detail of the questions shows the wide range of issues involved. I will not try to address every question separately; that would be an impossible task, given my limited speaking time. However, I would be very happy to provide detailed information at a later stage.  I shall therefore focus on three key areas, but first I should like to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem, already mentioned by many speakers. Every year,  270   000  women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the European Union. That affects their lives and the lives of their families and it has a very significant medical, social and economic cost.  The first issue I should like to touch upon  and it has already been addressed  is how far we have come since the European Parliaments resolution of  5  June  2003 . It is true that the resolution set out some ambitious targets for the Member States to reach by  2008 , notably a  25  reduction in mortality and a reduction in differences between breast cancer survival rates in the Member States to  5 . I have to admit that it is too early to know exactly how much progress has been made. Member States have committed themselves to report to the Commission on the situation by the end of this year, three years after the adoption of the Council recommendations. The Commission will therefore produce an implementation report in  2007 . I can assure you that the lack of information from some Member States will not delay production of the report. Instead, the report will indicate the Member States that have not provided the information.  There are already signs that the resolution and other actions have had positive effects and started to make a difference. We expect progress on aspects such as the exchange of best practice models to facilitate application in different parts of the EU and the guidelines for screening diagnosis, delivering some very significant reductions in breast cancer mortality. In addition to providing the results on mortality, we hope to have the data to be able to set out a clear picture of the timeframes involved and developments as regards inequalities.  The second general area I should like to touch upon is research. Breast cancer will feature strongly under the Seventh Framework Programme. This will cover both the detection of the disease and, crucially, the causes  in other words, how it can be prevented.  As regards detection, research is focusing notably on improving breast cancer screening and alternatives to conventional mammography, in order to improve early detection. Examples already supported under the Sixth Framework Programme include mammography with molecular imaging or the application of positron emission tomography  PET  specifically designed for breast cancer examination. Early detection is, of course, crucial in ensuring successful treatment, but that is still treating the disease rather than the causes. I am therefore very pleased that work on the causes of cancer is a priority in the Research Framework Programme. That work will cover the three key areas of genetics, environment and lifestyle.  Thirdly, the issue of campaigns: these can play a very important role in public health issues, in raising awareness of key issues by private individuals, public authorities and decisionmakers, as well as, of course, health professionals. Not only does it enable individuals to help and protect themselves, it also puts pressure on the decisionmakers to give priority to this problem, which they sometimes fail to do.  The European Parliaments  2003  resolution has been an effective part of an ongoing campaign to increase awareness. Awarenessraising among women on the importance of screening has been a key part of European action against cancer. Such campaigns can be supported under our public health programme.  In conclusion, we all agree that breast cancer has to be tackled and best practice examples show that significant results can be achieved. However, we have to understand that it is a continuous process. We must never become complacent, even if we are encouraged by the initial success of some of those efforts and initiatives. A coherent and collaborative approach is needed, covering in particular the three aspects I highlighted earlier.  Of course, we have to admit that most of these actions are principally for the Member States, but the European Union can and will provide support  as in the case of research  where possible. As an indication, I can refer to future support for breast cancer screening guidelines, which will continue under the current and future health programmes, the European Council network and the European Union network for information on cancer in Europe. A new project that has now been shortlisted answers some of the questions relating to the extension of the guidelines. The European Union guidelines will be updated to cover not only the setting of standards for breast cancer nurses but also the specification for specialist breast units. They will set the standards, principles and benchmarks to which Member States will have to adjust their breast cancer screening, training and treatment. These initiatives will cover the need for information and consultation in the new Member States as well and will help to integrate the relevant experts within existing networks.  We must never forget that each year more than a quarter of a million women depend on such action. They and their families depend on the priority we and the Member States will give to such an important and serious problem. We must not let them down.  (Applause)
9381772 author: Mary Jones:  rapporteur.  Mr President, thank you for introducing us to this first budgetary debate for  2007 . At the outset I should like to thank all those who brought us to this stage, particularly those in the secretariat of Parliaments Committee on Budgets and those associated with it. Without them it would have been impossible to get ourselves to this state of preparedness.  In setting out the guidelines for the  2007  budget  one that is different from others in the sense that it has been the first budget in the new financial perspective  much of the first part of the year was spent in negotiating the result of the financial perspectives. Indeed it is a rare budget when we find that we do not yet have some of the programmes in place, because the multiannual programmes are in the process now of being completed as, let us hope, the Financial Regulation will be in place for the beginning of next year to be the basis for our operation.  In terms of general considerations, there are three that I should like to set out, which have shaped our strategic thinking in the Budgets Committee in presenting this budget to Parliament.  Firstly, as we noted in the annual policy strategy (APS) discussions in May, which form the basis for our preparation for this budget, the speed of globalisation outside Europe is shaping our policies. I believe we have rightly criticised the Commission for taking a laidback and complacent view on this. We need to be able to take account in our budgetary policies of the effects of what is happening elsewhere in the world.  Secondly, we are acutely aware that the results of the financial perspective discussions have left us with fewer resources than we might otherwise have hoped, and therefore lead to the need for prioritisation in the way in which we shape our policies.  Thirdly, we must communicate better with our citizens and give them the confidence that we are capable of running the budget effectively.  That being said, what has the process now led to in what we voted for? First is the general outlook. In terms of commitments I believe we have been very prudent in allowing significant margins in the various parts of the budget, well under the ceilings provided for in the IIA; and for the first time since  2000  we are not requesting the flexibility instrument.  On the question of payments, we have taken a horizontal approach that reflects the approach taken by Reimer Bge, as our rapporteur on the financial perspectives  whose report Parliament adopted  in outlining a number of priority areas; and this is what we have reflected in taking payments on first reading to  1 . 04 , yet again well beneath the ceiling allowed for  2007  of  1 . 06 . This is also keeping a ratio between commitments and payments below  80  in most cases.  In terms of the pilot projects and preparatory actions, we have a range of different possibilities; in terms of internal policies, where we are wanting to underpin innovation, and where we are looking in terms of security at a major initiative on migration management, thanks to our friend and colleague Mr Deprez from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; and, last but not least, on external policy, to see what we can do to build up linkages with China and India, because, as reflected from the outset, in the present globalising world we do not have the right kind of networks which link our business and scientists with those of China and India. We are putting these in as preparatory actions to be approved under the  2007  budget.  Lastly in terms of payments, I have mentioned the common foreign and security policy, the CFSP. There are some in the Council who think that we are not being particularly generous in leaving it at a cut of  50 . There were those who wanted  100 , but we reached  50  as a good compromise because there are a range of people, particularly in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but also elsewhere in this Parliament, who would like to see the commitment entered into by the Council fulfilled for the way in which we handle the common foreign and security policy between Parliament and Council.  Equally, in terms of the special representatives, where we are recommending that the whole sum be transferred to the EU delegations, the point we are making on first reading is that we want to have, if not special treatment, at least clarity in the way in which these people are appointed. As the amendment says, we would like to adopt guidelines for the decision to establish, select and appoint EU special representatives and for the regular assessment of their work.  Turning now to the second aspect, which is value for money, this is an innovative concept where what we want to do is to stop throwing good money after bad. I do not think there is anybody in this House who has opposed this particular kind of concept, which is involved in identifying those lines where we know from the different reports available to us that the policies are being implemented poorly, either quantitatively or qualitatively.  Thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgets  though it would have been nice if the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control could have contributed more to this process  by looking at our own cost benefit analyses, at the Court of Auditors reports, at the budget forecast alert and at the synthesis reports provided by the Commission, we have been able to identity a number of lines which we unanimously have voted into reserve at  30  on first reading in the Committee on Budgets. The intent is to be able to release these sums by the end of the year on second reading, so long as we can have a satisfactory explanation from the Commission on  15  November, when we will have a joint Committee on BudgetsCommittee on Budgetary Control meeting to examine these lines and to see whether they are now operating positively. The whole idea behind this is that we can purge the budget of those lines which are operating ineffectively, and move towards what we are looking for, which is a positive statement of assurance.  Where the Council has suggested that this might be against the Financial Regulation, I think Article  43 ( 1 )(b) makes it quite clear that where there are sufficient grounds for us to put monies in the reserve, then we are entitled to do so.  It would be nice if, by the end of our process  maybe on the margins of our conciliation meeting with the Council on  21  November, or in our vote in December  we could come to a common statement by Parliament, the Council and the Commission on how we handle this concept of value for money on a regular basis, so that we can make it a part of our process, rather than something treated in an arbitrary manner.  There are a few last comments on other aspects  budget control and value for money. The first of these is shared management: the problems about which we heard from the President of the Court of Auditors in the Budgetary Control Committee yesterday evening, when, much to my surprise and that of other colleagues, he said he was not particularly interested in shared management because the Council pays and it is the Commission that takes responsibility for signing off the budget. I do not think it is possible to have a statement of assurance unless the Member States sign up to their responsibilities under the budget for the funds that they pay, which amount to  75  or  80  of the budget. Therefore, shared management is something we think is important to have implementation of the IIA provision.  Secondly, as regards work on the agency  which Mrs Haug has so ably coordinated for us  we are putting sums of money of the increases in reserves so that we can hear views from the agencies as to what they will be doing with their money and their work programmes in order to get value for money once again.  Last but not least is the question on the administration, where the Council actions on first reading to effectively diminish the number of Commission posts by some  2000  in the next few years are something we have not been able to sign up to. We believe that we need a screening exercise of the Commission by  30  April  2007  so that we can understand what the midterm demands of the Commission are before taking radical action to cut back.  In addition to that, we would not only like a state of play from the Commission as to which of the outstanding regulations we could have withdrawn, but above all what we would like is to be sure that we have clarity between what we have here in the budget process and the legislative process of the work programme which is decided on by the Commission today; so that when we have a final decision on this budget, hopefully in December, and the resolution from Parliament on the legislative work programme, then both of these can be bound together and we can have the Commission President come to Parliament in February  2007  and tell us what the final work programme of the Union is. Otherwise it is unclear to citizens.  Therefore, I would conclude by saying that this is a budget which in terms of priorities is what I would call a budget which is consistent and forwardlooking; in valueformoney terms, it is a budget which can be said to be coherent and prudent; and lastly, that in taking these two building blocks together, we will be able to look forward to the review which will be coming by  20082009  and have a very clear position for the European Parliament in order to ensure that where we need increases in particular policies or different actions to be taken on policy matters, we will be well prepared for that debate.  (Applause)
95917 author: Sebastian Brown:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and the Committee on International Trade for the excellent work that they have done on this important issue.  The European Union is a major exporter worldwide and this leaves us exposed to trade defence actions by third countries. When such actions are taken in compliance with WTO rules, we cannot and should not complain, and we do not. However, that is not always the case and these actions can easily become a serious and unjustified impediment to our legitimate market access opportunities.  Therefore, we must closely monitor thirdcountry actions against our exports and intervene to minimise the negative impact of such actions on our companies. And we should certainly be vigilant. Whenever possible we favour the diplomatic route, which is the quicker and the most efficient way to solve those issues when we have partners who wish to solve them. But when diplomacy fails, we do not hesitate to resort to WTO panels, as it is our right to do.  Both the diplomatic and the litigation approaches have met with notable successes. Take, for example, the Indian cases mentioned in the report. Diplomacy has resulted in the removal of no fewer than  12  measures. We also hope for significant success on the agricultural products cases that you have identified.  It is well known that the United States is a recurrent problem for us in this context. It is profree trade, but its use of the trade defence instrument is seen by many as unreasonable on certain issues. This has been particularly marked in the steel sector, where we have been arguing against certain practices for years on a large number of their dumping and subsidy measures. We have had a considerable success in Geneva but, frankly, it is a long hard slog even getting them to implement the remedies to the disputes which they have lost.  We cannot solve everything through diplomacy or litigation. This is why we welcome your support for the proposals we have tabled in the Doha Round to strengthen the rules and the disciplines governing the use of antidumping and countervailing measures.  The Round is suspended, something I deeply deplore and regret, but we are fighting hard to get it restarted. For trade defence this would allow us to seek improved disciplines along the lines of the EU practice in this field, making it more difficult for countries to abuse the system, which I am afraid some are only too prepared to do. We need tightened disciplines in the antidumping system.  We need greater transparency in the operation of trade defence instruments. We need less arbitrariness on the part of governments. Such behaviour simply discredits the rules. It brings the system into disrepute and it does not reflect credit on the multilateral trade system and its principal institution, the WTO.  We agree with you that the dispute settlement mechanism is an essential feature of the WTO system, which needs protecting, but we are working hard to improve it so that faster remedies can be achieved.  We will take the opportunity of any bilateral trade agreement with third countries to ensure that our partner countries take on specific obligations on the fair use of trade defence instruments. This is not an alternative to strengthening and improving the rules at the WTO. On the contrary, it underpins that. It is a way of getting insurance in place, so that we can use all available methods to bring reason and discipline to the operation of these instruments. This would particularly apply for those countries that abuse them the most.  Good practices are as important as good rules. That is why the Commissions departments devote a great deal of time and resources to providing technical assistance to third countries that become new users of trade defence instruments. Our aim is that they should apply them in a fair and balanced manner and in accordance with our own high standards.  These efforts seem to bear fruit. The end of  2005  saw a welcome change from the trend of previous years, with a significant fall in the number of trade defence cases initiated against Community exporters, from  33  in  2004  to  19  in  2005 . Market access, including a fair and proper implementation of WTO trade defence instruments by our trading partners, features high on our priority list and we will continue to take any steps required to ensure that our exports are not unduly penalised.  Of course it is difficult to follow each and every case with our current resources and I would certainly like to do more for our exporters, in particular small and mediumsized companies, which often have little experience in this area. The EU must remain an example that others can follow.  As the report recalls, we are viewed as a moderate user of trade defence instruments. That reputation is deserved and that must remain so. It is in that spirit that I recently launched a reflection process on how Europes trade defence instruments such as the antidumping instrument operate in the modern global economy. A broad public consultation will take place early in  2007 , based on a Green Paper expected in the coming months.  This consultation will allow the Commission to draw on a wide range of views and identify whether there is scope to improve our rules and practices further. Our trade defence instruments can make an important contribution to ensuring both free and fair trade, thereby stimulating our competitiveness. This will involve strong and close cooperation with all stakeholders, including Member States and industry, and, I would add, the support and involvement of the European Parliament.
7688174 author: Christoph Bauer:  Mr President, I have never been a unilateral disarmer at any stage in my political career, in any context. I have always been a multilateralist, whether it be in respect of disarmament or the putting in place of international rules to create institutions of global governance or in the design of processes to create agreements or to solve disputes in the world. I bring those principles and that approach to this subject as I have done to others throughout my political career.  We have heard a call this evening for moral leadership. The morality that I bring to this subject of trade is my belief in free trade. I say it is moral because I believe that free trade is the best way to drive economic growth, to lever up living standards, to create opportunities for people and to attack poverty in our world. That is what I call moral.  However, one of the ways in which we morally pursue free trade is by standing up for fair trade. When I look around me and see the public disquiet, uncertainty and unhappiness about what is going on in the global economy and the sense that people feel increasingly insecure and threatened by the dramatic changes that are taking place in the architecture and landscape of the global economy, I see people beginning to question whether free trade is a good idea. I see them beginning to wonder whether sheltering from the global economy would be better; whether erecting barriers between us and our trading partners might not be a better way of securing our jobs and our livelihoods.  I make a very strong argument against that reaction and instinct, but I will never help that argument against protectionism if I am seen to be or thought to be weak when it comes to standing up for the upholding and implementation of internationally agreed trade rules which stand out against anticompetitive behaviour, state interventions or trade distortions, which are designed to give one trading partner an unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable advantage in trade against another. That is why it is appropriate and proper to operate trade defence instruments within the rules created by our multilateral institutions.  However, I would never want to see those rules used as a weapon against others lowcost competition or against others legitimate use of their comparative advantage. That is not right and it is not acceptable, but nor, if I may say to Mr Kamall, was that the case either in respect of textiles or shoes. Shoes, yes, was an antidumping measure, arrived at after considerable investigation, analysis, recommendation, discussion, debate and finally decision amongst our Member States, as it properly should be. I would stand by the objectivity and the transparency with which that decision was arrived at, and it certainly was not adopted for protectionist purposes.  However, in the case of textiles, I never said it was unfair trading. I never said that the fierce competition that we were facing in the case of textiles was as a result of price or market distortions by the Chinese. I merely pointed to the fact that with the final lifting of quotas we in Europe were suddenly and unexpectedly faced with what amounted to an avalanche which, if it had not been resisted, would have had the likely effect of burying our market and severely distorting what people produce, how people sell, their profits, their livelihoods and, therefore, their jobs in such a sudden way that I believed it was appropriate  and, in the end, our Chinese trading partners also agreed that it was right and appropriate  to take voluntary cooperative measures to slow down the rapid increase in Chinese textile exports.  You are right that at all times, on all occasions and in all cases we should operate impartiality, transparency and truthfulness in the analysis we put forward, the conclusions we reach and how we seek to justify the measures we are advocating.  It is true, as Mrs Handzlik said, that any intervention of any sort in the market  legitimate, antidumping or other uses of trade defence instruments  is bound to create some uncertainty and weaken the ability of businesses to plan ahead. Mr Kamall made a similar point. I take this very seriously indeed, because I do not want my actions, as agreed by the Member States, to have the effect of making a bad situation worse by further disrupting or undermining the ability of companies to plan ahead and to organise their production, which, of course, is hampered if supply and production chains are undermined or disrupted by interventions such as these. Therefore we must minimise the disruption. One of the things I want to take very seriously in the context of our Green Paper and our examination of this matter, is how we can minimise disruption and offer the greatest possible predictability to companies that might be affected.  I just want to make this last point: Mr Caspary said  if I may elaborate on and embroider his words slightly  that we should keep to the rules and at all times seek to strengthen and improve them. I agree with that. That is precisely what we are doing in the DDA and why we have a multilateral system and process governing these rules and an institution that enables us to negotiate precisely the strengthening and the improvement that you advocate. That is why the WTO system is so important.  I would just like to say in conclusion that, whatever disruptions, interventions, distractions or diversions we have in a trade agenda which is very wide and very complex, I will always keep my eyes very carefully focused on the DDA, the importance 100 on equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, and Convention No 111 on discrimination in the workplace. In the multilateral context, a reference to core labour standards was included in the declaration of the first World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Singapore in 1996 . Regrettably, WTO members did not agree to include this issue as part of the Doha Development Agenda. Nevertheless, the Commission is committed to addressing trade and social development, core labour standards and commitment to meaningful dialogue between the WTO and the International Labour Organization, both in the EUs own trade policy review and the trade policy reviews of other countries. As part of this process, the International Convention of Free Trade Unions reports on core labour standards are prepared ahead of each trade policy review. The Commission is also strongly in favour of observer status for the ILO in the WTO. The European Commission has also pursued social development objectives in regional, biregional and bilateral arrangements. All its most recent agreements recognise and promote social rights as part of the universal objective of decent work for all. The Commission has, for example, entered into dialogue and cooperation with countries such as Chile, South Africa and biregionally with the ACP countries, the Gulf Cooperation Council, Mercosur and other regions. The European Commission remains of the view that the discussion and pursuit of social issues should not be used for protectionist purposes and it rejects any unilateral sanctionsbased approach. The objective is to further social progress with a view to promoting benefits for all. Since 1998 the EC has also been granting trade preferences under the Generalised System of Preferences, special incentive arrangements to those developing countries that assure the respect of the core labour rights as defined by the ILO and comply with international recognised standards on sustainable forest management. Currently, some 180 developing countries and dependent territories are granted GSP. In the framework of the new GSP scheme, adopted on 27 June 2005 by the Council, a GSPplus initiative for sustainable development provides additional tariff preferences for countries that have signed and effectively implemented UN and ILO conventions on human rights and labour rights, including those on gender equality. A total of 15 of the agenda we are pursuing in the DDA and the vital importance of bringing those negotiations to a successful completion. I want to do that in respect not only of market access but also of trade rules and their strengthening, and that is what the Commission remains dedicated to achieving.
6045669 author: Sarah Reid:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, since our last debate there have been substantial developments, to which PresidentinOffice Lehtomki has just referred.  I visited South Caucasus in early October as a member of the Troika, when the ENP Action Plans with all three countries were finalised. They will now be officially signed and adopted in November. I think that this is a basis for strong operational cooperation.  Before I talk about EU support, I think it is important that we also recall the impact of our relations with Russia. During recent months, we have seen gas price increases for Moldova, import bans on Moldovan and Georgian wines and water, the de facto support given to Transnistria in the referendum, and the strong reaction to Georgias expulsion of Russian military officers.  These issues were addressed with President Putin in Lahti and I personally raised some of these issues with Foreign Minister Lavrov only a few days ago in Moscow. The forthcoming Foreign Ministers Permanent Partnership Council on  3  November and the EURussia Summit in Helsinki on  24  November will enable further discussions to be held on these issues.  Let me also mention that the OSCE played a very helpful role in refusing to observe and recognise the referendum in Transnistria and also in returning the Russian officers from Georgia to Russia.  I shall now say a few words specifically about Moldova and Transnistria, and then on Georgia. I would also like to highlight the very successful EU Border Assistance Mission, EUBAM, which has played a very important role in introducing a new customs regime between Moldova and Ukraine. This programme was allocated EUR  20  million for two years and over  70  customs officials and border guards were seconded from our Member States. All major Transnistrian companies have now registered in Chisinau and are working under this new regime. Combating customs fraud will thus crucially cut the illicit revenue currently enjoyed by the Transnistrian leadership.  While we are happy that highlevel talks between Russia and Moldova have recently resumed, we have been concerned about Russias support for the Transnistrian leadership. In a recent statement, Minister Lavrov called for political recognition of the results of the referendum in Transnistria, which neither the European Union nor the OSCE recognised. I think this could complicate the task of finding a solution to this conflict.  We are also worried about the insistence by Transnistria and Russia on the need for a socalled transit protocol between Moldova and Transnistria that would recognise the latter as an independent international economic actor. This issue is the stumbling block in the settlement talks which resumed after a silence of more than six months, albeit not in the full  52  format, but with only mediators, with each of the two sides separately, in other words  51 .  This approach is unacceptable, as we have made clear to Russia on several occasions. More than that, developments on the ground, with all major Transnistrian companies now working legally with Chisinau, show that such an approach is increasingly out of touch with reality. We were also worried that the new Ukrainian Government would change track on this issue. I was very pleased when Prime Minister Yanukovich assured me of the ongoing support of the Ukrainian Government. We will continue to stress the importance of Ukrainian cooperation at the forthcoming summit in Helsinki in a few days time.  Some have pointed to the ongoing discussion on railway issues between Moldova and Ukraine as further proof that Ukraine might abandon its earlier position. The facts, however, do not bear this out. We therefore strongly encourage both sides to find a mutually advantageous solution to this situation as soon as possible.  Our presence on the ground through the EU Border Assistance Mission provides us with an excellent instrument for following the situation and giving advice and assistance to both sides. Let me add that under the new ENP instrument, Moldova will see a substantial increase in our funding. It will also receive a grant under the macrofinancial assistance programme to help it address the shocks caused by increased energy prices and the Russian ban on Moldovan wines.  We are highly concerned about the crisis in relations between Georgia and Russia, especially the continuing tensions between the two countries. We are particularly worried by the expulsion of large numbers of Georgians from Russian territory, which appears in direct contradiction to Russias commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and to the  1975  Helsinki Final Act. I also raised this issue recently with Mr Lavrov.  Georgia also bears its share of responsibility. During our recent visit to Georgia in the Troika mission, I urged President Saakashvili to display moderation and encouraged him to rebuild trust.  Let me say a final word on South Ossetia. I think it is disappointing that the recent meeting of the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia was inconclusive. We understand Georgias wish to renew and review the Joint Control Commissions composition, but existing peace mechanisms should be fully utilised until new ones are in place and the recent Needs Assessment Study and the June  2006  international donors conference show that there is scope for a constructive dialogue. We are pleased that this rehabilitation programme is continuing despite the crisis.  We have made a significant financial contribution to assist a peaceful settlement, including a EUR  9 . 5  million economic rehabilitation programme in South Ossetia. Funds for rehabilitation have also been earmarked under the new EC financial assistance programme for the period from  2007  to  2010 .  I think the European Union as a whole has a very important role in supporting any peace settlement. But the most immediate need is to get relations between Russia and Georgia back on a normal track, on a diplomatic track. We will certainly continue our efforts to achieve that objective.
5062440 author: Philip McNabb:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety, Mr Florenz, and all the other speakers for their very positive contributions to todays debate.  I would like to add to the list of nationalities that Mr Bowis referred to. This was a Greekowned ship, under the flag of Panama, but it was timechartered to a Dutch company, which operated it from Switzerland, with a Russian crew, financed by British and international banks and with a variety of nationalities on the board of the company and as shareholders. Happily, it was blocked by Greenpeace in Estonia and the Estonian authorities thoroughly investigated the case.  I should like to assure the rapporteur that first proposal, which contains a minimum level of penalties, will be merged with the framework decision of the Council and basically it will be along the lines of what you proposed, with certain amendments at first reading.  With regard to the question of whether a ship carrying hazardous waste is allowed to leave a European Union port, if the waste is hazardous it is not allowed to go to a destination outside the OECD. That also applies to slops  the ships own waste water  that contain hazardous substances.  I will continue to follow closely all developments in the criminal investigations and proceedings that are currently being conducted in the Netherlands and Estonia regarding the toxic waste dumping in Cte dIvoire. The Commission is also in the process of collecting any information available in other Member States concerning the vessel Proba Koala and its journey. I hope that we will soon be able to draw conclusions from that and find the best way forward in preventing such incidents in the future. We must keep in mind that the tragic incident in Cte dIvoire is just the tip of the iceberg. We know that is so from inspections carried out in Member States by their network of implementation and enforcement agencies, IMPEL. In  2005 ,  51  of the waste shipments checked were found to be illegal.  Most of the cases do not make big headlines but they can, nevertheless, pose a serious risk to the environment and human health. We must make it very clear that our society does not tolerate environmental crime and that we are determined to take all possible steps to fight it. But legislation that we have adopted to better protect our environment and the health of our citizens will not achieve its objectives if we do not take the necessary measures to ensure that it is properly enforced. I can assure you that the Commission is determined that environmental legislation should be properly applied throughout the Community.  We are already taking a number of specific initiatives in order to ensure that the European Union waste shipment regulation is correctly applied and illegal waste shipments are prevented and reduced. This includes the preparation of guidelines to be adopted in connection with the application of the new waste shipment regulation next year and the organisation of awarenessraising events in Member States.  The Commission meets representatives of national authorities responsible for waste shipments on a regular basis. This takes place within a wellestablished framework and includes multilateral meetings in Brussels, as well as bilateral contacts, but these initiatives need to be supplemented by measures to establish effective sanctions.  One of the many measures taken by the Commission for this purpose was to propose a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law. As I have already said, it is regrettable that the Commissions proposal was not taken up by the Council, due to a difference of views on the correct legal basis. Now, however, the Court of Justice has confirmed that the Commissions views were correct.  The Commission is preparing a new proposal for a directive which will give effect to the Courts judgment and should be adopted soon. It has taken some time to produce the amended proposal, because the Commission has very carefully analysed the Courts judgment and made a comparison of the original Commission proposal as amended after Parliaments first reading and the Councils framework decision. In addition, an impact assessment is being carried out to analyse the various options for action.  The Commission thinks it is necessary to amend its proposal of  2001  after the Courts ruling, to ensure that all criminal law measures necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the Communitys policy for the protection of the environment are included in the proposal. The Court has made it clear that the parallel adoption of a directive and a framework decision, as was done in the past, is no longer possible. Also, after five years, the Commissions proposal needs to be adapted to legislative developments.  I would like to clarify that the Commission does not want to harmonise national criminal laws fully. The aim is that only those steps which are necessary for the effective implementation of environmental policy should be taken at Community level.  In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again the importance of good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in the forthcoming codecision procedure for the adoption of the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law. We have the same goals, namely to protect the environment by establishing minimum standards for the sanctioning of environmental offences and to try to eliminate the possibility of safe havens for environmental offenders in the European Union. Acting together, we can take a big step towards achieving these objectives.  Finally, as regards the ratification of the Basel Convention, I have sent letters to more than  50  countries around the world asking them to ratify the Convention. To avoid any wrong conclusions, I should clarify that the Basel ban is mandatory, legally binding, for the European Union Member States, even those that have not ratified the Convention, because we as the European Union have signed and ratified the agreement.
3080077 author: James Cameron:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, first of all I think this is a very timely discussion. Thank you for putting it on the agenda.  I have followed closely the discussions in the AFET Committee on Ms De Keysers substantive and comprehensive report. The report is a fair account of the internal and regional challenges facing Syria. I welcome this reflection by the European Parliament on the way forward with Syria. After the conflict in Lebanon and in the new context of United Nations Security Council resolution  1701  ( 2006 ), it is indeed the right moment to reassess where we are with our current policy.  Syria is a longstanding partner under the Barcelona process and is a potential candidate for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the medium term. I share your view that we have a strong interest in bringing that country closer to Europe. Syria, as we all know, is an essential player for stability in the Middle East. It is a key part of the puzzle when it comes to finding a longterm solution to the conflicts in the region and also in the implementation of resolution  1701  in full. In this critical moment for the peace process, Damascus has the power to be part of the solution and not part of the problem. This means that we expect Syria, as you have stated in the motion for a resolution, to pass the right messages to Hezbollah and Hamas, to prevent arms shipments into Lebanon, as our colleague from the Council has said, and to help with the settlement on the Shebaa Farms. As I have indicated, I believe that reengaging with Syria should be part of our strategy. A different issue is then whether and how far we can reengage here and now. The first thing we need in order to reengage with Syria is for its leaders to show their commitment and their interest in moving forward and taking positive steps on a number of issues.  As you well know, lately we have gone through difficult times in our relationship with Syria. Ms De Keysers report addresses a number of the political divergences. Overcoming the political deadlock depends on the leaderships ability to translate some of its words of goodwill into deeds of goodwill. Syria has a new opportunity at this critical time for the peace process to demonstrate that it is serious about contributing positively to regional stability.  In the absence of an association agreement, we have limited scope to tackle matters of concern. Nevertheless, we have tried where we can, and where we feel it is of interest for the people of Syria. We have tried to continue programmes in those areas that directly benefit the citizens of Syria. For example, on human rights, the European Union uses diplomatic channels to address the most serious violations, including, for instance, the cases of prisoners of conscience. We have also reacted to the limitations on freedom of expression and the wave of arrests that accompanied the publication of the BeirutDamascus declaration last May. But it is not by cutting off contacts that we will achieve much progress. With no dialogue, we have no influence.  We should therefore turn the situation around, give a positive perspective to relations with Syria and set out the areas where we expect progress. We do so in part through our cooperation programmes. Syria now seems to be well engaged on the road to economic transition and we welcome the approval of Syrias national agenda for reforms sponsored by Deputy Prime Minister Dardari last May. Support for the implementation of the reform process, including progressive steps to political opening, could be the focus of our action in the next few years, if things go well.  Cooperation under the ENPI  the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument  will allow us to give Syria the mediumterm prospect of full participation in the Neighbourhood Policy. The ENP will then bring additional benefits and, we hope, a more interesting package for them, when the time is ripe.  As for the association agreement, it is still on the table. We have finalised all technical preparations and we have initialled the agreement. Now, it is pending a decision on signature from the Council. Signature is a process. So far, political circumstances have not been right. Member States still expect Syria to take more positive and credible steps to make signature possible, including on regional issues such as Lebanon and Palestine.  Syrias recent statements to facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolution  1701  may be encouraging signs in this respect, as are President Assads calls for resuming peace talks, which have had some positive echoes in Israel.  Like the European Parliament, the Commission is a strong believer in dialogue. Therefore, I very much hope that the positive messages that we have received from Damascus lately will be transformed into deeds and that we will be able to restore a strong relationship with that country.
1342761 author: Katarina Cameron:  VicePresident of the Commission. Mr President, first of all my warm thanks, on behalf of the whole Commission, for all your important and constructive contributions to the debate on next years work programme, which I have been listening to since  3  oclock. My first comment will be a political one and then I would like to say something about the process. But what I have heard is really a common call for sustainable development, meaning that a majority of you have mentioned the need to create jobs and growth. This is the start of the debate, but we have to respect the most important resource we have, people, and make sure that we have a social security and social protection system that reaches out effectively to all citizens.  It has to be sustainable growth, which means we have to take account of natural resources, energy issues and environmental constraints. That is exactly what sustainable development is all about, making sure that we do it the European way, ensuring that all these three elements are covered by an ambitious policy for jobs and growth in Europe.  I have heard these calls for quality jobs and investment in education and innovation, research and development. As you know, this has been part of our political agenda from the first day of the Barroso Commission.  We propose to respond to this, because it is totally in line with this Commissions political ambitions, and we propose reforms in this work programme. We propose social cohesion and I think it is important to mention in that context, since there was also a debate about regional policy, that we now have in place all we need  budgets, regulations, etc.  for a regional policy for  2007  to  2013 , and that we are negotiating right now with Member States on the programmes.  We hope for close cooperation with Parliament on implementation. The urban dimension is taken very seriously by the Commission. The earmarking takes account of the needs of both more and less advanced regions in Europe, because there have been references to unfair cohesion policy and we say that all three dimensions of cohesion must be taken seriously. This is also reflected in the new regulations, where partnership is in principle obligatory and  82  of the structural funds goes to poorer regions. Investment in people is one of the three objectives of the cohesion policy and I think that point should come out in the debate.  We are also proposing security measures. Security includes making sure we can live free from terrorist threats and crime and from environmental pollution. We say we need to approach this with a lot of optimism and in partnership with all the stakeholders involved, but engaging with Member States.  This has to do with the issue of soft law. Many of you have mentioned soft law, compared with other measures and legislative acts. It is important to mention that this Commission work programme for  2007  contains  34  legislative proposals, representing  36  of the total,  57  nonlegislative proposals and one negotiating mandate. That is more than last years  24  legislative proposals,  57  nonlegislative proposals and five negotiating mandates. This figure shows that the proportion of legislative initiatives has increased from  27  to  36 . At the same time, the proportion of nonlegislative proposals has slightly decreased.  With a more diverse Europe, we also have to invest more in working with Member States to ensure that we prepare for good and better regulation and legislation that will be implemented. Therefore we need better consultation and betterprepared proposals in order to see better results, and that also applies to working methods.  Mr Harbour asked about resources. In some cases, perhaps the Commission should ask the European Parliament to give us the resources we need. As you know, at the moment we are discussing how we can have enough resources to do everything Parliament has put on its wishlist. I have heard so many proposals for things that ought to be added to the list and things that you have missed  initiatives or legislative proposals  that should be on this list: energy initiatives, migration initiatives, the single market review, the social reality stocktaking, the emissions trading scheme, a European strategy for social services, a Community framework for efficient health services, etc. These  21  strategic objectives cover exactly the three pillars of sustainable development. If we are to add more of these initiatives or more work, we also need the resources and we cannot pretend otherwise. We are concerned about the budget for the Commission. We have to explain to our auditors, the European Parliament and the other institutions, how we use our money. However, we can discuss the structure until the cows come home, but in the end we have to choose and we have chosen to make this a more political document and explain the priorities of the Barroso Commission.  The different structure you propose makes a lot of sense, but I think this is the way to ensure we can have a real political debate about priorities. That has been our wish from the beginning, in engaging with the European Parliament to discuss the work programme. This reflects the kind of dialogue we have had with the European Parliament for a long time, with contributions from all the individual committees. I think I am speaking on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we have welcomed this and have enjoyed that debate and interaction with the European Parliament.  I would also like to say that when several of you ask for things that you feel are missing, that is in a way the tip of the iceberg. So much is being done all the time in the Commission and our departments. Here you find the strategic objectives, the strategic initiatives, that we say we will give priority to. At the same time there are a number of things in the pipeline. You are right on that point, Mr Harbour: you have to decide to give priority to a number of them. You will also find a list of communication priorities. That is in response to some of the very important remarks on human rights and antidiscrimination.  As you know, next year will be the Year of Equal Opportunities. That is one of our communication priorities, on which we will definitely engage with the other institutions. Whether or not there should be a directive will be debated constantly with the European Parliament, but we can only present directives when we are ready and the circumstances are right. That will be debated later with the different committees. Antidiscrimination and human rights are part of everything we do and clearly a political priority in all our activities.  We welcome your contributions. I find in your comments support for the high ambitions that the Commission has for  2007  and I also welcome your firm support to work together to achieve them. We are also committed to listening to citizens and to delivery, to becoming more accountable, transparent and effective. We thank you for your support in pursuing and strengthening our efforts towards better communication.  Now the Commission will study the content of the resolution you will be adopting in December. The Commission will respond in the most appropriate and timely manner. The presentation of the annual policy strategy for  2008  could be the moment when the Commission explains how it intends to take account of the resolution on the work programme.  I should like to reiterate that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to our framework agreement. It has proved a solid basis for productive working relations between our two institutions. It should remain our common objective to make the best use of it.  Mr Duff, we meet regularly in discussions about the constitutional treaty and, as you already heard from President Barroso, we have great hopes also for next year. We shall now start preparing to move the institutional issues and hopefully the constitutional treaty forward next year. We will have to work with Member States and engage in a dialogue with them as to how we can do this in a balanced and effective manner. But it is clear that the problems addressed by the Constitution have not gone away. They are there and accentuated by next years enlargement. That is why we have to come back to the issue. We have to engage in a debate. However, it has not been a detour to say that we also have to have a period of reflection and that we have to engage with citizens. That has given us a lot in return. It has been necessary, because we can see a change of debate and atmosphere in many Member States. It is important to know that we can mobilise that support in trying to find a solution to the constitutional issue.
3373620 author: Helen Whittacker:  author.  Mr President, I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members. I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets.  The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on  4  April  2006  and what future steps are planned in this area. Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling?  As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive, we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article  49  as regards the free movement of services. The Commissioner will be aware of the committees decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive, not least because of the complexity of the gambling market. However, the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States, which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the crossborder supply of online betting and gambling services.  We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article  49 , while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest, as long as the rules are necessary, proportionate and nondiscriminatory, i.e. not discriminating against other EU operators. It is hypocritical, on public interest grounds, for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market, while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules. That is the issue we hope the Commission will address.  I would like to take the debate in a different direction. I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market. This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR  20  billion by  2010 . In  2003 , in the EU 25  commercial gaming industries, lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR  51 . 5  billion and there are some  2300  worldwide online casino sites. In the UK, for example, during the World Cup football matches,  30  of those making online bets on UK services were women. It crosses all classes and all generations. The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries.  However, let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the  2006  Bush legislation  the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites. This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the socalled protection of consumers against gambling excesses. In reality, it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market, while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services.  I believe it would be good if the Commissioner, on behalf of the  25  Member States, would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling. This is one way to minimise the differences between not only the international community but also the EU Member States, to ensure in the end that all states opt in to high standards both for operators and consumers. The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers, in particular young adults and minors, to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities.  The internet genie is out of the bottle: some  3 . 3  million EU citizens are regular online gamblers. This is a market that will grow. The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards. We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling. The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate.  I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonights debate to continue with infringement proceedings. However, in reality, it is a thankless task, which takes years to resolve, often not with a satisfactory conclusion, and I believe the best way forward is for the EU now to be a leader, driving good and high common international standards that can help minimise the differences, protect consumers and force the operators to be socially responsible.
3230930 author: Katarina Reid:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, the vote at second reading on the Services Directive will be a milestone in the history of the European Parliament, not only because of the importance of this Directive for European citizens and businesses, but also because of the leading role Parliament has played in the legislative process.  It is undeniable that the Services Directive is an essential element in our efforts to boost the European economy and unleash the potential of the internal market for services.  The text which is now on the table will provide real added value to the internal market, cutting red tape, removing barriers and improving legal certainty for business and consumers. It lays solid foundations for a new internal market framework with a positive impact on the freedom of establishment and the creation of new business.  This is crucial for fostering entrepreneurship and for promoting growth and jobs. Service providers can be confident that they are dealing with fair and transparent authorisation regimes and swift and simple procedures. They will be able to obtain information and complete administrative formalities through points of single contact in any Member State and, in addition, in electronic form. This will simplify, accelerate and reduce the cost for the setting up of new business and obviate the need to deal with different levels of authorities.  Equally, the Directive will provide a welcome boost to crossborder service provision. The new provision on the freedom to provide services, which was at the heart of the compromise in first reading, strikes a fair balance between guaranteeing the rights of service providers to free access and free exercise of a service activity whilst allowing Member States the right to invoke their most essential requirements in certain clearly defined circumstances. This will definitively improve legal certainty for service providers and consumers.  Importantly, the Directive will be underpinned by obligations on Member States to cooperate among and assist each other, in order to ensure that businesses are properly and efficiently supervised across the European Union while avoiding duplication of controls.  These three elements  simplification of establishment, freedom to provide services and assistance and cooperation between Member States  were always at the core of the Commissions drive to open up the services market. The position of the European Parliament has been crucial to finding a broad consensus on these issues.  In this dossier, the European Parliament has shown its maturity and capacity to find wellbalanced compromises on very complex issues. At first reading you clearly took the lead and were able to deliver the broad consensus we pursued.  Getting a consensus in the Council was not easy. Some Member States had serious difficulties in accepting your delicate compromise on the scope of application of the proposal and the freedom to provide services mechanism. In the end, and after a vigorous defence by the Commission and the Presidency of the compromise reached in Parliament, the common position was adopted. It is a common position that respects and reflects Parliaments political compromise, with only minor adjustments introduced mostly to provide greater legal clarity.  You are aware that the compromise reflected in the common position is very delicate and fragile. Attempts to reopen the text will inevitably give rise to a new debate in the Council and put in jeopardy the compromise reached. I call on Parliament to recognise that the common position closely reflects Parliaments first reading, and to refrain from seeking further modifications through amendments. The vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on  23  October  2006  demonstrates that this is possible.  At this juncture there are no technical or minor amendments.  I am aware that in discussions leading up to the vote in the committee, certain institutional and legal issues have been raised which are of concern to some Members of this House. In this context, I would like to make the following statements to address the concerns that some of you have raised.  Concerning the screening of national requirements which Member States apply to services provided from other Member States, the Council has requested the Commission to provide orientations and analysis and the Commission will use its best efforts to abide with this task. This will not give additional powers to the Commission which may, pursuant to the Treaty, if it considers it necessary, formulate recommendations and deliver opinions on matters dealt with in the Treaty. The orientations will merely consist of assistance to Member States for the proper implementation of the Services Directive. They will neither provide legally binding interpretation of the Directive, which is the prerogative of the European Court of Justice, nor will they amend the provisions of the Services Directive, which is the prerogative of the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission will carry out this task in an open and transparent manner in close cooperation with the other institutions. It will in particular regularly inform the European Parliament about the results and the followup of its analysis.  Concerning the need to consider further harmonisation, in the future review of the Services Directive, the Commission will assess whether, in the field of services, further measures are necessary and, if so, what kind of measures are appropriate. The Commission will, in particular, examine whether for certain services or certain issues there is a need for additional harmonisation.  The Commission will thereby take suggestions made by the European Parliament, in particular at the first reading of the Directive, into consideration. Where necessary, and in line with our Better Regulation approach, the Commission will make specific proposals, including proposals for harmonisation, where justified.  Concerning the impact of the Services Directive on labour law, the European Parliament and the Council wanted to avoid that the Services Directive affects labour law or the rights of the social partners to defend their collective interests. The Commission wants to state unambiguously that the Services Directive does indeed not affect labour law laid down in national legislation and established practices in the Member States and that it does not affect collective rights which the social partners enjoy according to national legislation and established practices. The Services Directive is neutral as to the different models in the Member States regarding the role of the social partners and the organisation of how collective interests are defended according to national law and practices. However, Community law, and in particular the Treaty, continue to apply in this field.  Concerning the impact of the Services Directive on criminal law, as is stated in the text, the Services Directive will not affect Member States criminal law rules. This means that in general Member States will be able to apply their criminal law rules not only to service providers established on their territory but also to service providers from other Member States providing services within their territory. This is because criminal law rules, in general, apply to everybody in the same way, irrespective of whether a service is provided. However, Member States may not circumvent or prevent the application of the provisions of the Services Directive by making use of criminal law.  Concerning the impact of the Services Directive on Social Services, social services relating to social housing, childcare and support of families and persons in need are a manifestation of the principle of social cohesion and solidarity in society and are provided by the State, by service providers on behalf of the State or by acknowledged charitable organisations. These services have thus been excluded from the scope of application of the Services Directive. It is clear that this exclusion also covers services provided by churches and church organisations which serve charitable and benevolent purposes.  I have arranged for the text of these statements to be handed in to the secretariat for inclusion in the record of this partsession.  I hope that these statements help to accommodate the concerns raised by some. The Commission hopes that they will facilitate the acceptance of the common position by Parliament.  Before concluding, I note that Mrs McCarthy has tabled three amendments on behalf of her committee relating to the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny. These amendments result from the agreement reached between the three institutions last summer on the revision of the comitology procedure and can be accepted by the Commission.  Next week it will be two years since this Commission entered office and I became Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services. The debate on the Services Directive has been at the forefront of attention for much of that time. I think we should now move to adopting the Directive and start implementing it. I look forward to hearing the view of this House.  (Applause)
5598326 author: Jennifer White:  VicePresident of the Commission. Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the honourable rapporteur for this excellent report. The Commission works hard to promote gender equality both within and outside the European Union and in this regard the European Parliaments sustained commitment to these issues is vital.  The world needs women leaders at all levels, be it in local communities or in international politics. Women and men must participate on equal terms in the drafting of agendas that affect us all and in the development of solutions to the problems we are facing.  However, if we look around us, what do we see? Men still make most of the decisions. The main examples given in your report clearly demonstrate that the picture is not ideal even for our European democracies and, as you correctly point out, further efforts are needed even inside our respective institutions, the Commission and the Council, to achieve a better gender balance.  Stereotypes and discrimination persist, biased recruitment and promotion systems are rampant, labour market and educational segregation hinder women in achieving their full potential.  One of the core factors remains the imbalanced division of work and family responsibilities. While the competence to act in this field remains at national level, I am convinced that the Commission can bring real added value by promoting awarenessraising, information gathering, research and analysis, networking and dissemination of best practice. This role of the Commission is clearly reflected in our March  2006  Communication Roadmap to Gender Equality. The future European Institute for Gender Equality will also help keep the issue high on the European agenda, collect and analyse data, conduct research and disseminate good practice.  One priority of the roadmap is promotion of the participation of women and men in decisionmaking processes. Considering that negative gender stereotypes are strongly related to the unequal representation of women, we have chosen their elimination as another key objective for our programme.  Amongst the Commissions strategic actions for the next five years, the establishment of a European network of women in economic and political decisionmaking can be highlighted, as well as awarenessraising campaigns, data collection, analysis and exchange of good practices involving all stakeholders to combat gender stereotypes.  The roadmap also includes the promotion of gender equality outside the European Union. As an example of our action in the external policy field, I would like to mention the FiveYear Action Plan on Gender Equality being signed today in Istanbul by Ministers from the  35  countries of the EuroMediterranean Partnership. Womens political participation is one of the key pillars of todays Action Plan that will be supported by a regional project starting in  2007 .  Through the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights, we fund several projects promoted womens empowerment. As examples I would like to mention the regional project in West Africa aiming at enhancing womens participation in five countries of the region, the regional project in Latin America, seeking to enhance the democratic participation of young people, particularly girls, and the projects undertaken in Egypt, Jordan, Nigeria, Morocco and Kyrgyzstan to empower women to actively participate in political life.  It is useful that a reference to elections is included in the report. In that context, the Commission has already incorporated the gender perspective into the election observation methodology and womens participation is systematically monitored throughout the Election Observation Missions. A good example of this can be seen in the European mission recently deployed to Yemen.  As you know, the Commission has a strong and longstanding commitment to mainstream gender across the board in our external relations. Since  2001 , the Programme of Action for Mainstreaming Gender Equality in Community Development Cooperation has given us a framework within which we have implemented an extensive training programme and developed political tools. In  2007 , in cooperation with the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation, we shall be launching a new capacitybuilding programme, this time directed principally at our partner governments, civil society and other programmeimplementing partners in third countries. A specific thematic focus of this programme will be the promotion of womens participation in peace building, along the lines of United Nations Security Council Resolution  1325 .  Finally, it is clear to me that, although progress has been made, tremendous efforts are still needed to progress towards gender equality and womens effective participation in the political sphere. In that respect, the Commission is committed to continuing to mobilise all the instruments available. Pressing issues include the following: first, we need a stronger gender focus in electoral, constitutional, legal and judicial matters. We need to enhance our support of womens active involvement in defining and implementing policies at national level. Secondly, companies need more women at board level to ensure that the widest possible range of thinking, perspectives, experience and abilities is brought to bear on highlevel decisionmaking. Third, overcoming gender stereotypes in education, training, the labour market and in the media remains an important challenge in all countries.  Finally, to achieve gender balance in decisionmaking, men must be mobilised and fully involved if we want to move ahead. Familyfriendly policies for women and men, such as more flexible working arrangements and quality childcare facilities, can be of much help.
8568594 author: Jennifer Merx:  VicePresident of the Commission. Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this very important report. The European policy against trafficking in human beings is a priority not only for this Parliament but also for the European Commission and myself.  There is a need for further and more effective action to fight trafficking. Even though many initiatives have been taken at national and international level, the results are not comparable to the enormous scale of the criminal phenomenon. The European action plan approved, as you will remember, last December, is the framework for practical action aimed at tackling all aspects of trafficking.  I should like to stress some priorities that, in my view, are necessary. First, for the Member States, it is essential that they accelerate the application of Directive  200481 EC on the residence permit issued to thirdcountry nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal migration and who cooperate with the competent authorities. It concerns, in particular, assistance and social reintegration measures, the reflection period and the issuing of the residence permit to victims of trafficking, taking into account also the Council of Europe Convention of  2005 .  In this regard, it is important to point out that the reflection period and assistance measures are granted to victims irrespective of their willingness or capacity to cooperate with the law enforcement authorities and that, after the issuing of the residence permits, victims have access to the labour market, vocational training and education.  What is the situation so far? Unfortunately, it is very disappointing. So far only two Member States have transposed the European directive and only six other notifications of initiatives to transpose have been examined by the European Commission. There have been no notifications at all from  12  Member States. As you know, the transposition deadline expired on  6  August  2006  and I have therefore decided to start infringement procedures against all Member States that have not yet transposed this very important EU directive.  Concerning assistance and social reintegration, the need for close cooperation on a regular basis between public authorities, including law enforcement authorities, and NGOs must also be stressed. I believe it is very important to have close and permanent cooperation between public authorities and the private sector on protecting and reintegrating victims.  Concerning investigations, following the initiatives taken by Europol, international police cooperation between Member States special units should be enhanced. I am promoting and encouraging better and closer cooperation between all the specialised national units dealing with countering trafficking in human beings. However, on this point, there is a consideration I should like to submit to you. With regard to prosecution I note, with disappointment, that very often charges against criminals exploiting victims of trafficking  for example for sexual reasons  are very weak, focusing only on the simple exploitation of prostitution instead of on the very real charge, which should be the reduction of victims to slavery conditions. It is up to the prosecutors to decide charges, but I really hope that magistrates and judges will now take a much tougher line than in the past. That is the real situation.  There are also priorities for the European Commission. I have decided to set up an expert group on trafficking in human beings. That group of experts will deal specifically with indicators and criteria in order to identify different forms of trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation. In the same context, at the beginning of  2007  I shall propose European legislation on sanctioning employers who exploit illegal workers, whose working conditions are sometimes akin to slavery.  Concerning trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, we shall shortly be producing a questionnaire aimed at evaluating, inter alia, the possible impact of new legislation criminalising the use of sexual services in the knowledge that the person concerned is a victim of trafficking. I am therefore keeping my promise to you about this questionnaire.  Furthermore, the root causes of trafficking must be addressed, including poverty, lack of job opportunities, gender violence and gender discrimination. My departments will shortly be hosting an interdepartmental seminar on this issue, precisely to focus on the main problems that are emerging.  One last important point is awarenessraising. The Commission is supporting the designation of an antitrafficking day, possibly on  11  June. That initiative aims at increasing the visibility of the problems connected with trafficking and the measures taken to counteract trafficking itself. It will call for cooperation from public institutions and civil society and evaluate the quality and the results of all the actions that are under way.
10118199 author: Alastair Jones:  rapporteur.  Mr President, Bulgaria applied to join the European Union  11  years ago, in  1995 , and negotiations were opened five years later. Since those days we have seen remarkable changes: on the economic front GDP has doubled, foreign investment has increased from less than USD  100  million to over USD  1 . 7  billion, real wages have increased year on year and unemployment has halved.  Since the opening of negotiations, we have seen three changes of government, representing a wide range of the political spectrum: from the UDF Government of Ivan Kostov, to the return of former King Simeon to lead his National Movement Government from  2001  to  2005 , to the present socialistled coalition under Sergei Stanishev. All have played a strong part in the reform process, taking forward Bulgarias progress towards EU accession.  This progress has taken place in spite of a very difficult regional situation, with conflict on Bulgarias borders. The NATOled operations against Serbia began in March  1999  with air strikes that destroyed the Danube bridges and severed navigation between the upper and lower Danube for two years. In addition to this economic disruption, devastating floods hit parts of Bulgaria in  2005 , with many deaths and thousands left homeless.  The fact that we saw NATO accession in March  2004  and have now reached the point of EU accession is a tribute to the determination and hard work of so many at all levels and from all shades of government, and no less a tribute to the Bulgarian people. They have seen their country turned over, examined and criticised at an accelerating pace. They have put up with dramatic change, as well as generalised and unjustified insults, but they have shown the forbearance and resolve to press on regardless, mindful perhaps of that old Bulgarian saying: a gentle word opens an iron gate.  I have always said that modernisation should be seen as beneficial in its own right and not merely as a prerequisite to EU accession, a sentiment that is reflected in my report today. At the same time, we all recognise that this process will continue for many years after accession.  Many of you know that I am critical of so many aspects of the European Union, but I believe that the enlargement process is a great achievement, extending the area of democracy, stability, security and prosperity ever more widely, with generous financial support. Provided that funds are well targeted, properly managed and well used, this is ultimately to the benefit of all citizens, not least the people of Bulgaria.  Let me focus on two particular issues. Police and judicial reform has been a major concern throughout the accession process. There has been much progress, but there is still a long way to go. Old habits die hard and there are so many competing demands for public expenditure. However, there is nothing more important for the daytoday confidence of citizens in their government and administration than a professional, competent and fair justice system. I call for even more tangible and visible action by the Bulgarian authorities in dealing with serious crime.  Let me also touch on the subject of Kozloduy, which has attracted much attention. Bulgaria is one of many countries in Europe facing an energy gap in the years ahead, with increasing reliance on energy imports from Russia and areas of instability. I am a great believer in safe, sustainable energy resources that minimise carbon emissions, as well as diversity and security of supply. The mood has changed and there is wide recognition that nuclear energy must play a stronger role. This is particularly true of Bulgaria, which has generated electricity from nuclear sources, both for its own requirements and for other countries in the region.  The current undertaking is for the two reactors, Units  3  and  4 , to be closed this year and subsequently decommissioned. We have reiterated the call for a little flexibility rather than unnecessary dogmatism. This will give time for more attention to be given to redressing the economic consequences of premature closure and for progress to be made in creating additional sources of energy supply.  Let me briefly turn to another burning issue. We have still to secure the release of the Bulgarian nurses from Libyan custody. They have been wrongly incarcerated now for seven years. What a gesture it would be if they could be home for Christmas! I hope that the message to the Libyan authorities will be even more powerful with Bulgarias imminent accession to the EU. I should like to call on you, Mr President, the Council and the Commission to make a further appeal to President Gaddafi.  Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to many charities that have worked hard in Bulgaria over the years, including Save the Children, ARK and Harvest for the Hungry, which is based in my own constituency in Chelmsford.  I wish to thank the Bulgarian Observers for their cooperation and assistance. I look forward to working closely with Bulgarian MEPs next year, following elections in the spring, and I also want to thank Parliament for the privilege of being its rapporteur these past six years. In particular, I thank successive Bulgarian governments and the people of Bulgaria for their stoicism and friendship. We very much welcome them to the club.  (Applause)
6190155 author: Sarah Cameron:  Mr President, at this late hour, I wish to begin by thanking this House, on behalf of all the researchers in Europe, for your words of support during this threehour debate.  Many of you mentioned funding. Unfortunately, we have lost the bet, because the number seven would be really lucky  seven years, seventh programme, EUR  70  billion. In any case, we can still be proud of what we have achieved, because it is a serious increase.  I have no doubt that the programme will be adopted tomorrow. Then we can continue with our work for the future. Firstly, on the question about fisheries, I would simply add that we now have theme No  2 , named food, agriculture, fisheries and biotechnology. This was the last change that was made at the last debate, so it has been included.  I should like to draw your attention to many important things that are part of our achievement. We will all have to consider in the future how the European Research Council is developing. It is a major thing for Europe. It is a major breakthrough that for the first time we are able to gain sources together at EU level, finding excellence without political interference, including mine. That is a major change in thinking, which I hope will be a source of future decisions connected with the European research area. We have European technology platforms which go far beyond the framework programme and they have much more potential. We talk about publicprivate partnerships in joint technology initiatives, which will be a delicate but worthwhile exercise in the future. We will also have to monitor these closely. We will have to deal with a risksharing finance facility, which you mentioned, and I am fully aware that you are expecting simplified procedures, which will not be easy to achieve. I am committed to doing that, but I sincerely hope that I will have the support of all those who can help.  Unfortunately, I have learned that sometimes it is simply impossible to meet all expectations. If, on the one hand, you have private needs which seek fast solutions and, on the other hand, public money, you cannot come together  100 . We will do our best and we will try, but I just want to say that in some areas it is simply the logic of the work which does not fit  100 .  We have a major success with the framework programme which we are putting on the table. However, the framework programme is only the foundation on which we have to build. We have to go beyond that. That is why I want to launch the debate on the European research area immediately. I have three major reasons for that. Firstly, the area was launched in the same year as the Lisbon Agenda. That may be a coincidence, but I do not think so, because the European research area is the main part of Lisbon thinking.  Secondly, in  2009  we shall be embarking on a new Financial Perspective debate. It will be more than a new Financial Perspective debate, it will be a debate about how the future Europe should look. We should come into this debate with strong potential and only if we truly have a debate about European research area behind us will we be strong enough to show clearly that all the messages I have heard today are the right ones. Also, the others will understand them.  Thirdly, when we talk about constitutional, institutional changes, we must be present at that debate. This debate will come alive soon and in this respect it is also important how the European research area and European research cooperation will be treated in future. Those are enough good reasons when we will be dealing with international cooperation, funding, infrastructure facilities and many questions which concern what we have done up to now and how we can improve in the future.  When we talk about the famous  3  that we all have in mind, let us be clear that we have two major challenges. One challenge is coming from the developed countries. Here we are lagging behind in yearly funding for science and research. When we talk about the developing countries, it is not money that is the problem, but the pace, because they are making rapid progress. Those are the two challenges we have to face. When we talk about  3 , we have to be clear that its composition is twofold: public financing and private financing. In a way, since we can make decisions directly, it is easier to handle public financing. However, it is not always easy to come to the figures like in FP 7  we were like to, but still it is in direct political control. But when we talk about private financing, which normally consists of twothirds in normal circumstances, we do not have direct control. Here we can either go in through direct activities which are clearly linked to that, such as state aid, tax incentives, intellectual property rights, regulations, standardisation, lead market initiatives, public procurement, risk venture capital, and so on. However, if we are honest, then we have to take into account those things that are connected with competitiveness and the internal market.  On higher education, if we do not make progress quickly, then higher education and universities in Europe are really the engine behind everything: the labour and financial markets and, finally, the coherence between macroeconomic policies and structural policies which have to be in place. So when we talk about our issues, these are the issues of all the governments, the whole Commission, the whole Parliament. We cannot settle them alone. That is why we always have to look at the big picture and why the debate on which we have to embark in the future is that one.  We have to build on a positive climate which I think we have in Europe. We are now clearly devoting political attention to knowledge, research and development, but it is not important that we get it there, it is important that we keep it there. Why? Because only if we have constant strategic attention for a period of some years can we truly count on serious changes in Europe.  It is true that it is almost midnight but, if we work together, I am sure it is not too late.  (Applause)
2180405 author: Roger Bush:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, I very much welcome the publication of the  2006  annual report on human rights. This is the first time that this report has really been a combined effort. We have battled for that. Last year we had the debate here in plenary and I said that I would be very happy if we could prepare the report together. I would have liked to have one of the prefaces. Unfortunately it seems it was too late, but I think the Commission should have been visible.  It now seems to be an established practice always to have a special session on human rights and democracy before Christmas. It is a good tradition; it is a noble tradition, to see what has been implemented and what the new developments are.  The annual report this year is again a valuable record of the combined efforts of us all in promoting and protecting human rights around the world, and a reflection of the positive way in which the European Union has come together to produce it.  This debate gives me the opportunity to quickly highlight some activities in  2006 .  First, mainstreaming human rights into external policies ranked high on our EU priority list in  2006 , thanks to the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies. It is indeed a source of satisfaction to note that all actors within the EU are more and more committed to this very important aspect of our policies. However, let us not forget that mainstreaming or, as I also like to call it, integrating human rights into all policies, is not an end in itself, but an approach to achieving overarching goals. For the European Union, these goals have a clear basis in our Treaty, which calls on us to develop and consolidate democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through our various external policies. In this context, we are particularly pleased that human rights and democracy issues have been integrated into the legal texts of all the new financing instruments under the  20072013  Financial Perspective.  Secondly, mainstreaming is a neverending process; we need to constantly maintain our efforts and introduce new tools. I am happy to inform you in this context that last June the Commission revised the mandates of its heads of delegation, following up on the report by Mr Agnoletto. These mandates now specifically mention human rights and democracy issues, and therefore place greater priority on reporting and acting in this regard.  Similarly, in the context of the human rights clauses of our agreements, we have seen the creation of the new forums for dialogue or exchanges of views with third countries. The number of occasions to discuss the promotion of and respect for human rights has been growing, from Argentina and Bangladesh to India, Jordan, Morocco, Turkmenistan and Vietnam. That is in addition to the institutionalised human rights dialogues and consultations and the various political dialogues where human rights issues are regularly raised.  Last but not least, the Commission continues to include the human rights and democracy essential elements clause in the negotiation of the new bilateral partnership and cooperation agreements. This is, for instance, the case for the agreement with six ASEAN countries. Likewise, preparations are being made for negotiating an agreement with China, and the Commission remains fully committed to the inclusion of this clause in conformity with our standard practice.  Thirdly, while mainstreaming or integrating human rights issues in all our policies, we also need to focus on some specific aspects of the human rights policy. These have been exemplified by two communications from the Commission: one called Roadmap on equality between women and men and the other Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child.  The year  2006  has also been characterised by the pivotal changes seen within the United Nations human rights machinery, with the new Human Rights Council that has already been mentioned. Whilst there was initially great cause for optimism, for example the active participation of NGOs in debates or the desire to move away from the failure of its predecessor the Commission for Human Rights, the overall picture at the end of the year is a cause for concern, not least because of the discouraging signs of politicisation of this new forum. We, the European Union, have to renew our efforts and engage more with a number of actors in Geneva in order to convince them that the international community needs an effective Human Rights Council. We still have the possibility to make this new body work and deliver. Indeed, we have to remain hopeful that todays special session on Darfur will yield some positive results.  I cannot conclude without indicating once again my personal satisfaction, as well as the Commissions satisfaction, with the vote that took place earlier today on the proposal for a regulation establishing the new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. This instrument will make it easier for the Commission to establish priorities when implementing the objectives contained in the regulation and in keeping with its scope.  However, we know too well that measures to promote human rights and democracy deserve to be as worldwide, numerous, multisectoral and crosscutting as possible. The fact that the number of beneficiaries has expanded will also have to be taken into account. But the enhanced complementarity with the various tools, which range from political dialogue and diplomatic demarches to various instruments of financial and technical cooperation, including both geographic and thematic programmes, is warmly welcomed.  Finally, we are looking forward to developing more integrated approaches to human rights and democracy under the new instrument. There continues to be some debate about human rights and democracy as if they were two different issues. However, we think that human rights are the foundation for democracy and democracy is necessary to develop and protect human rights. Therefore, let us not create artificial demarcations. In any case, we think this is a good basis for continuing our work in the year to come.
6070919 author: Roger Finlayson:  rapporteur.  Mr President, I should like to draw the strands together as this will hopefully be our last debate on the  2007  budget. I should also like to welcome the Council and its representatives, who have been somewhat confused at some points in our procedure, which has led to misunderstandings that we hope will be clarified before we come to the final vote.  I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for all the support she has given to most of Parliaments ideas. Her support has been very helpful during this procedure. I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets for their support and input into this procedure, but above all I should like to thank the Committee on Budgets staff who have enabled all of this to be put together. Without them I do not think we would be at this stage in the proceedings.  At this juncture I should like to raise a couple of points as general rapporteur. Not only have we been able to achieve  I believe it will be clarified that we have achieved this  the substantive negotiation on the Financial Regulation, which my colleague Mrs Grle will deal with in a moment or two, but we have been able to establish in our way of doing things for the  2007  budget a very prudent approach on payments below the  1 , largely because we are at the stage of having new programmes for the Financial Perspective. There are no particular requests or demands from the groups or committees. That is something we can no doubt expect in future years. So basically we reestablish the PDB, but with emphasis on our political priorities concerning research innovation where we have had additional appropriations.  Secondly, we have taken what I would call a sensible approach to the use of the reserve. Often in this House we have been able to put particular funds on reserve at first reading, but perhaps the conditions for release or the way in which this has been approached have not been sensible or coherent. Here there are three examples that I would like to mention where I believe the conditions for release and the policy for reserve use have actually been helpful in strengthening Parliaments position in the budget process.  Firstly, I would cite the common foreign and security policy where we have a much clearer definition of what we gained in the interinstitutional agreement. We would very much hope now that the Council will hold to this, as we have had a very clear exchange of letters and we should not then have the same misinterpretation in the  2008  budget.  Secondly, on the question of staff, here too Parliament has been able to provide a way of sensibly dealing with that process, rather than what might have been an immediate surge  as the Council wanted  of productivity gains but maybe not achieving very much. We have been able to ask the Commission  and it has agreed  for a proper screening process to be established by  30  April  2007  so that we can have a substantive justification for staff increases over the next few years. That will be very welcome as part of the conditions for release of the staff reserve will be a statement from the Commission in February next year. So we will know exactly what the legislative programme for the Union will be in February  2007 .  Last but not least in the use of the reserve is the question of value for money. We had an excellent discussion and debate on  15  November at our last session with the Commissioner and the SecretaryGeneral, who came to show exactly where we had taken lines in reserve and where we could now release them. We have very few of those lines left available now. That has been a very useful process in getting a much better perception as to where the lines are weak and where we have weak implementation. We welcome the Commissions participation in that.  Looking ahead, it seems to me that we now have to implement this resolution on the proper implementation of the budget. Perhaps the Council could come along and sign the resolution on value for money. If it does not do it now, hopefully it will do so under the German Presidency.  We need to maintain our priorities. We have been very clear. We have taken on the priorities of the Financial Perspective. As we now look further forward to the  2008  and  2009  budget years, there is a lot of work to be done.  We are not going to escape from the speed of globalisation. That was the first point we made when we looked at the APS back in May. We are going to have to adjust the programmes for financing, looking forward to seeing where our money can be best spent.  (The President cut the speaker off)
9436310 author: Mary Cameron:  Member of the Commission. I should like to thank the honourable Member for her question concerning the Commissions followup to the recommendation set out in the report on womens networks, fishing, farming and diversification adopted by Parliament on  15  December  2005 .  The Commission considers the situation of women working in the fisheries sector, and in particular their legal and social recognition, to be a very important issue. It is using all the instruments at its disposal to promote equal treatment and opportunities for women and men in the sector concerned.  As regards the four specific questions raised by the honourable Member, the Commission would like to point out the following.  Firstly, the European Fisheries Fund, which is the new structural instrument for fisheries for  20072013 , explicitly states, in Article  4 (g), that one of its objectives is to promote equality between men and women in the development of the fisheries sector and fisheries areas. The EFF is based on the principle of partnership with all stakeholders in the fisheries sector, and this explicitly covers partnership with bodies responsible for the promotion of equality between men and women. The EFF contains specific provisions promoting gender equality, both through better womens representation in decisionmaking processes and in the programmes to be implemented by Member States. In particular, the Commission is encouraging participation by women in the various stages of implementation of the European Fisheries Fund, including the design, monitoring and evaluation of the Member States operational programmes for the next programming period.  The Fund can also support measures aimed at promoting equal opportunities between men and women through networking and the exchange of best practices among relevant organisations. The Commission will strive to ensure that Member States reflect these provisions and priorities in their operational programmes.  Secondly, the Commission recognises the importance of training in the fisheries sector, and education and professional training are eligible for support under the European Fisheries Fund. Training measures are also expected to promote access to employment for women. Moreover, under the Funds new priority axis  4  on the sustainable development of fisheries areas, support can be granted for the diversification of activities and the promotion of alternative employment for fishermen through a large variety of measures. Under this axis, special measures for the improvement of professional skills, work adaptability and access to employment for women can also be supported. It should be stressed that the Commission is promoting the involvement of women in the local bodies, managing the measures supported under axis  4 .  Thirdly, as mentioned above, the EFF requires Member States to ensure broad and effective involvement of all relevant partners in the different stages of programming, and this includes bodies responsible for the promotion of equality between men and women. The Fund also requires the operational programmes to contain information on how the partnership principle has been implemented, the list of the parties that have been consulted, the results of those consultations and how they have been taken into account. The new priority axis  4  on sustainable development of fisheries areas, supported under the Fund, will be implemented through a bottomup approach. It will be the local players, including womens associations, that will serve as the engine for designing and implementing local development strategies. This allows womens organisations to get involved in decisionmaking at the local level and ensure that their specific concerns and suggestions are taken into account in local development strategies. Women and their representatives are also encouraged to participate in the Regional Advisory Councils, which were set up to improve the governance of the reformed common fisheries policy. For instance, womens associations already have a seat in the North Sea RAC, which was the first RAC to be formed. Women are also represented in the North Western Waters RAC.  Finally, in the present programming period, under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, Member States can cofinance studies and innovative projects covering the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers. This possibility is also offered under the European Fisheries Fund, under priority axis  3  on collective actions. The Commission has since  2003  been launching a series of calls for proposals for innovative actions in the fisheries sector. These actions are now almost completed. In  2005  the Commission conducted an expost evaluation of these actions in order to assess their impact and added value. The results of this evaluation showed clearly that such actions do not have an added value, whereas innovative actions included in, and financed through, the operational programmes of the Member States, were more successful and better monitored.  Taking into account these conclusions, the Commission decided to integrate the implementation of those actions into the European Fisheries Fund Regulation and to support their implementation through the operational programmes of the Member States.
5579283 author: Victor Finlayson:  rapporteur.  Mr President, I would like to make five points about our report on integration capacity. I will start by thanking all those colleagues involved in the process and certainly those in the secretariat who did a wonderful job.  My first point is about the terminology we are using today. The original term which we dealt with was absorption capacity. When we were discussing who was going to do this report, I talked to Mr Absorption himself  my good friend Mr Brok. We came to the conclusion that perhaps absorption is not the best term to use. I think Mr Karl Bild put it very well when he said: who wants to be absorbed by the European Union? Does France want to be absorbed by the European Union? Of course the answer is no. So we went for a more dynamic, more positive term and decided that integration capacity is really what we are looking at.  My second point is that this is potentially a sensitive subject because there are many interests. My colleague and friend Mr Brok made reference to some of them. In other words you have those types of people who are against enlargement but for the Constitution. You have those who are against the Constitution but for enlargement. Then you have those like me who are for the Constitution and for enlargement, and then there are the likes of Mr Farage and the rest who are against both.  What we tried to do was swim through these four types of interest and I think we have done it fairly well in this report. The notion of integration capacity is nothing really new. We have always had it. There is always a debate before each and every enlargement about how much the European Union should deepen. Before  1973  the Union became a customs union. Before  1986  the Single European Act was put forward. Before the FinnishAustrianSwedish accession you had the Maastricht Treaty. Before the big bang in  2004  you had Amsterdam and Nice. What we want is to have a constitution before the next enlargement.  Thirdly, how do we define integration capacity? I think the conclusion of this report is that you can give a vague notion of what it actually means and you could say that it is not a condition for enlargement, but it is a criterion for us, the current Member States. We have to put our house in order before we are able to enlarge. The difficulty is that you cannot give integration capacity a strict definition because it is linked to two things. One: the time of accession. Two: the number of new states coming in. In other words, enlargement in  1973  was radically different to enlargement in  2004 . Still on the definition, integration capacity is about three things: institutions, budget and policies.  My fourth point is about the public debate, and here I would like to point the finger at the European Council, which is saying that we need to link enlargement to public opinion. We say yes, of course you have to do that, but do not tell me that you do not have the opportunity to do it. Enlargement negotiations are opened through unanimity. Each chapter is opened with unanimity. Each chapter is closed with unanimity. The whole package is approved by unanimity, and on top of that each Member State is supposed to ratify accession. If within those two to ten years you are not able to explain the benefits of enlargement to the general public I think you are miserably failing in your job, so please do your job and then come and start talking about public opinion. We need more strategic thinking on enlargement.  My final point is about the Constitution. This report outlines a number of issues which we desperately need to clarify before the next enlargement: qualified majority voting, legal personality, the foreign minister, common security policy, etc. These are issues that we badly need to deal with before we can enlarge. The message from this report is: let us get that house in order before  2009  and then start enlarging.  I shall finish with this. Enlargement is probably the best policy the European Union has ever had. It has brought with it peace, prosperity, security and stability. When we talk about enlargement let us not give poor excuses because we know that we are never and yet always ready to enlarge.  (Applause)
1593805 author: Claire McNabb:  Madam President, Members have decided to hold a joint debate on the three reports by Mrs Morgan, Mr Langen and Mr Seppnen. This provides an excellent opportunity to discuss topics of key importance for energy policy just before the new year, topics that brought a great deal of inquietude last year.  Let me begin by addressing the report on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy. First, I wish to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mrs Morgan, for her impressive work on the energy Green Paper. I also wish to thank and congratulate the draftsmen, Mr Zieleniec, Mr Wijkman, Mr Markov, Mr Ehler, Mrs Tzampazi, Mr Takkula and Mr Vlask, for their contributions.  This document is an important contribution to the Commissions work on the strategic energy review. Your work over recent months has fed into the Commissions wider deliberations on the future of energy policy in Europe.  I agree that the European Union needs an integrated, coherent and consistent European energy policy that maintains Europes competitiveness, safeguards our environmental objectives and ensures our security of supply.  I also agree on the nature of the climate change challenge. Climate change provides the strongest encouragement for a new energy policy. Energy accounts for over  90   of carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union, so we cannot tackle climate change without the right energy policies. I agree that the European Union needs to show vision and determination to lead the world in accelerating the shift to a lowcarbon economy. At the heart of this must be ambitious but credible targets for further reductions in greenhouse gases beyond  2012 . Without a functioning internal market, the emissionstrading system  the cornerstone of our efforts to deal with climate change in a competitive manner  will not work properly, nor will we achieve our aims of competitiveness and security of supply. Therefore, the Commission will keep up the pressure on Member States to implement the legislation fully.  This week, we adopted another package of infringement measures against  16  Member States. At this stage, we are conducting infringement proceedings against  19  Member States, and I believe that shows our determination really to implement the internal market.  In addition, in line with the conclusions of the internal market report and the final report on the energy sector inquiry, the Commission now intends to take action to address the remaining issues under the following headings: ensuring nondiscriminatory access to welldeveloped networks, notably by looking at the issue of unbundling; improving regulation of network access at national and EU levels, which includes better cooperation at EU level between regulators; reducing the scope for unfair competition, through increased transparency and improved access to storage facilities; providing a clear framework for investment; and strengthening the focus of the public service obligation.  However, the internal market can achieve its goal only on the basis of decisions taken by European citizens. The role of citizens is particularly important with respect to our energy efficiency agenda. This is an area where everyone can contribute to a more sustainable and secure world, and we welcome your support for the energy efficiency action plan. Europes citizens can also make a difference to the role of renewables in our energy mix, but we cannot expect people to make the necessary shift unless the political and investment plan is right. That is why I agree with the need for a stable and longterm framework for renewables.  Climate change, globalisation and longerterm targets call for a renewed effort on the technology front. We all want to see Europe lead the way in global research, which means spending existing research budgets better, getting them to work as a catalyst leading to increased industry research funding in the European Union.  The importance of the external dimension is also well articulated in the report. This year, our external policy has taken some very important steps: the establishment of the energy community and new agreements with several producer countries and transit countries, including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.  I would like to address Mr Langens report on a strategy for biomass and biofuels. First of all, I would like to thank Mr Langen for this valuable contribution and his great help to us in the Commission as we look forward on the issue of renewable energy, including bioenergy.  First, the EU, acting collectively, will need to strengthen the legislative framework for renewable energy, committing itself to the establishment of a stable regulatory framework based on ambitious targets. Longerterm, more ambitious objectives up to  2020  will need binding obligations on the part of Member States to guarantee burdensharing and the development of an internal renewable energy market. At the same time, we should allow a certain degree of flexibility to enable Member States to focus their attention on certain areas on the basis of their specific strengths and weaknesses.  Second, this framework will need to include legislative measures tailored to the specific obstacles facing renewable energy in individual sectors. For example, access to the grid is a key issue for renewable energy in electricity. The existing provision in this area may need to be strengthened. As regards heating, measures are needed to overcome unnecessary planning barriers to solar panels, for example, and to create a level playing field for district heating.  In transport, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the extra cost for biofuels is greater than that of renewable energies in other sectors, but we need biofuels in the energy mix because they are a tool not only for combating climate change, but also in terms of security of supply.  In looking at the detail of the report, there are three basic points that I would like to highlight. First, I welcome the emphasis the report places on the certification of biofuels to ensure that, whether produced in Europe or abroad, they need sustainability standards. I understand the logic behind the proposed ban on the use of palm oil. However, as the work of the round table on sustainable palm oil has demonstrated, the environmental impact of palm oil production can display enormous variations, and this has to be taken into account.  Second, I share the view that secondgeneration biofuels are critically important. They offer better greenhouse gas performance and improve security of supply by widening the range of feedstocks from which biofuels can be made. However, let us not create a false opposition between first and secondgeneration biofuels. Firstgeneration biofuels improve security of supply, too, by reducing dependence on oil, and they also offer greenhouse gas savings compared with conventional fuels. Moreover, firstgeneration biofuels serve as a bridge to the second generation. As secondgeneration biofuels come onto the market, they will take over the supply and distribution networks and plants of the first generation.  Finally, I would like to endorse the view that there is a need to do more to inform society in general, and farmers in particular, about the use of biomass and biofuels. We should particularly encourage farmers to venture into the new world of production of farm food and energy grasses.  Now I would like to address Mr Seppnens report on the Council regulation establishing an instrument for nuclear safety and security assistance. I wish to acknowledge and thank Mr Seppnen for the efforts made by the rapporteur and by Parliament as a whole to present this report in good time in order to have the new instrument available before the end of this year.  Improvement of nuclear safety has been an important part of our work in central and eastern European countries, as well as in the Community of Independent States, notably in Ukraine and Russia. But we have also made an effort in other countries, such as Armenia and Kazakhstan. It will remain essential in the coming years, as most of our neighbours and emerging economies rely heavily on nuclear power in order to satisfy their energy needs.  Because of the lack of time, I cannot comment on each amendment. However, I should like to highlight some important considerations that prevent us from accepting some of the amendments. I will not address the amendments on which we agree.  In Amendment  3 , the rapporteur proposes to add a reference to the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. The Commission considers that this is not the objective of this instrument and that it is covered by the instrument of stability.  Amendment  7  states that priority should be given to assisting nuclear installations and activities which are likely to have significant effects on the Member States. I understand the concerns that have led to this proposal. I would stress that the Community primarily supports improvement in nuclear safety installations close to our borders. However, I should like to repeat that the new instrument has a global objective; a nuclear accident in one place is a nuclear accident everywhere, as direct or indirect consequences will affect the whole world.  Finally, Amendments  27  and  28 , limiting the scope of application of the instrument only to nuclear facilities that are or were in operation in third countries on the date of the instruments entry into force. While it is clear that we will not provide assistance to the design and construction of new plants in third countries, there should be a possibility to provide assistance visvis all existing plants. Otherwise, we would lose an efficient instrument to influence nuclear safety abroad.  To conclude, I once again pay tribute to the work of Parliament and all the committees involved on the Green Paper, the strategy for biomass and biofuels and the nuclear safety instrument. I look forward to continuing our joint work for Europes energy future.  (Applause)
9270300 author: Lynne McNabb:  rapporteur.  Madam President, at the beginning of this year a harsh shiver went through the homes of many people in Western Europe as the Russian firm Gazprom turned off the supplies to Ukraine. The effects of that were felt throughout the European Union. A harsh shiver went down the spine of many politicians as we realised that in future, if we were to continue on our current trajectory, over  80  of our gas was likely to come from outside the EU. There are real securityofsupply issues that need to be addressed very quickly.  On top of this, there is an increasing awareness of the climate change agenda. It is affecting our planet more quickly and in more dramatic ways than were hitherto imagined. If we are to stem the tide of the effects that humans are having on the environment, we surely have to start by making radical changes in the way we use and produce energy.  I would like to think that the report we are voting on today will be an adequate response to those challenges. The Commission has set out its stall on the scale of the problem. We hope we have responded constructively to some of the tough choices that need to be made.  There has been no doubt that this is an opportunity for the EU to prove itself to the citizens of Europe. This is one of the greatest contributions that Parliament has made to this debate, putting citizens and consumers right back into the centre of the energy debate. If we are to take on these challenges the consumer has to be involved and we have to recognise that energy poverty is a real issue for millions of our citizens. Energy efficiency is surely the most costeffective way of meeting some of the energy challenges we face, and the Commission has come up with a very comprehensive action plan on energy consumption and energy efficiency. It is imperative that we try to make the European Union the most energyefficient economy in the world by  2020 .  This is a great example of a situation where we already have reams of legislation in place and Member States are ignoring the laws that they have signed up to. We have to reach a stage where we cut our energy consumption by  20 . Implementation on this is absolutely crucial and I would like to ask you, Commissioner, what further steps we can take. You suggested that we are going to initiate more infringement proceedings  but can we do more to name and shame Member States that are not implementing the laws that they have signed up to?  For too long, many Member States have been more concerned about getting the best deal for their national energy champions than helping or providing benefits for the consumer. Why is it that in the UK last year  19  of the public switched energy companies, while in France the figure was less than  2 ? Is it because all the citizens in France and in Germany are happy with their energy suppliers? I doubt it. I suggest that it is because it is extremely difficult for many companies to access these markets because of some companies inbuilt vested interests in keeping others out. That is why we have to do something very serious in opening up and unbundling the energy networks. When you arrive in the UK on the Eurostar, the first sign you see is a huge sign which says that lectricit de France is giving power to millions of Londoners. I dream of the day when I can get off the train in Paris and read a sign that says: Centrica  still not in Russian hands  providing power to millions of Parisians. I am afraid that day is a long way off.  Security of supply and sustainability have to go handinhand. We have to use mechanisms such as the emissions trading scheme to drive the economy. Energy mix is up to Member States, but let us be sensible and acknowledge that the energy mix in one country will affect others, and that is why we need targets on cutting CO 2  emissions by  30  by  2020 . We are insistent on binding sectoral targets of  25  in renewable energies. That means no less than a revolution in the way that many Member States produce their energy. We spend pitiful amounts on research and development and we have to work towards a truly common European energy policy in external affairs.  I would like to thank the other political parties, in particular Mr Reul, Mrs Ek, Mr Turmes and Mr Seppnen for their contributions and their support in this debate. I hope, Commissioner, you will take on some of our ideas and we look forward to receiving your ideas on the strategic energy review in the new year.
8094942 author: Alastair Reid:  President of the Commission. Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, former Presidents of the European Parliament, Presidents of the European institutions, honourable Members, this year we celebrate what the European Union has achieved over the last  50  years: a history which has seen the European Parliament increasingly come to embody European democracy.  I salute the presence here today of the former Presidents of the European Parliament. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, I thank you all for your individual contributions to Europe.  I want to congratulate you, Mr President, for this initiative. It is indeed important. Some politicians believe the world did not exist before they were born. I think that it is important that we who are serving our citizens through institutions keep this institutional memory. A decent and civilised society pays homage to its history and respects the institutions. I want to thank you for your speech, which had both vision and substance. I share the views and commend the commitment.  Honourable Members, you have elected a President whose experience and commitment to our common European project is second to none.  Our European values underline the essence of the Europe we want and treasure: a Europe of peace, freedom, democracy, prosperity and justice. The enlargement and integration of Europe to include  27  countries, free of war and free of totalitarianism, underlines the strength of these values and the lessons we have drawn from history: only through a shared undertaking are we able to provide the answers to our citizens in the global world of the  21 st century.  Cultural and religious pluralism is a strong European value. In this sense, I particularly welcome the emphasis by President Poettering on intercultural and religious dialogue. The European Union is well placed to promote this dialogue. We are steeped in diversity: diversity of traditions, of cultures, of language, of nations. It is one of our precious gifts as Europeans. We are to some extent a success in globalisation. We, better than anyone, can shape this globalised world.  Dialogue is the way to ensure that diversity, far from causing division, enriches our unity. I strongly believe that cultural diversity is a source of Europes strength and of its ability to promote its values and interests in the world. This dialogue has to be nurtured properly. We intend to make next years Year of Intercultural Dialogue the platform for this dialogue. The Commission has long pursued a dialogue with religions, churches and communities of conviction, including those who do not have a religion. I would like to take this forward in partnership with the European Parliament, as a visible demonstration of how European institutions, working together, take European integration forward.  To signal the importance of this dimension, last year I invited the President of the European Council to participate in a meeting with religious and church leaders. I welcome the agreement to hold a summit in May this year, with the three Presidents of the European political institutions and leaders of the main religions and churches, which I will be honoured to host.  On  25  March, we have the opportunity to celebrate both our achievements and our values. I am delighted that the European Parliament and the European Commission are playing a full part in the preparations for the Declaration on the future of Europe, following my proposal last May. This Declaration, to be signed in Berlin, represents a real common point of reference  a confirmation of what the European Union is for and a mission statement for what we want to achieve in the  21 st century.  Last month, in this House, I made proposals I would like to see in the Berlin Declaration. I did not do it for the sake of making proposals. They correspond to results that European citizens want us to achieve. And I believe that it is by focusing on the goals of our common project that we will be able to reach a strong and enlarged consensus, including a consensus for an institutional settlement.  I am convinced that if Europeans see the European Union addressing globalisation, promoting economic growth and jobs, showing social solidarity, tackling climate change, increasing democratic legitimacy, bringing security to its citizens, defending our values and interests worldwide, then they will trust the European Union to reform itself to meet tomorrows challenges and to deliver practical results.  We are all here to serve European citizens. If we are to enjoy public consent, we need to target our activities on citizens priorities and we need to work in a way that justifies their confidence, particularly respecting the principles of subsidiarity and transparency. We set out exactly this approach in our Citizens Agenda Communication of last May.  In order to achieve results, we need to preserve and develop institutional partnership; a partnership founded on the separation of competences, but also on the idea of institutional interdependence. While respecting the autonomy of each institution, we need to stress the commonality of our European principles. Despite some natural political and ideological differences, those who are committed to these principles should build a truly European partnership.  I believe that cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission is working well. It has proved itself against some stern tests. Over the past year we have seen difficult dossiers resolved on services, chemicals, REACH and the financial perspectives, to name but a few. This was a result of the three institutions working together with this spirit of partnership. I am committed to working closely with you, Mr President, as well as with Chancellor Merkel and her successors at the helm of the Council. I am convinced this is the best way to deliver the results our citizens demand.  The resolution of the debate on the future of Europe is not a sideshow: a more efficient and democratic European Union goes to the heart of our ability to deliver policies and results. We all know this is what the constitutional treaty would have achieved, and there are limits to what we can achieve without it. As I often say, we cannot build tomorrows Europe with yesterdays tools. The Nice Treaty is not enough.  (Applause)  I know that the European Parliament shares the commitment of the European Commission to give full support to the work of the German Presidency to find the right way forward. The energy and commitment of Chancellor Merkel gives us real hope that we can find a consensus and make a compelling case for reform and progress to European citizens. But the Presidency of the Council can only achieve results if it is supported by all the Member States. Today, where all the European institutions are here reunited, I wish to repeat my call on Member States to find a solution as regards the constitutional treaty. I know, after the no votes in two Member States, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to ratify exactly the same text. But let us not forget that all the governments signed the treaty. This has at least a double implication. First, Member States recognised that the Union needed to solve common problems and common challenges. And we have not solved them yet. Second, the act of signing a Treaty also implies a responsibility towards the other Member States, towards European institutions and towards European citizens. It is the duty of all European governments to be constructive and active in the search to find a common solution. And I would like to stress the word common. At a historical moment like this, when we celebrate the peaceful unity of Europe, we do not have the right to divide it again.  Regarding their positions about Europe, sometimes some politicians remind me of James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill once said that his father loved mankind in general, but hated each person in particular.  (Laughter)  We also see many politicians in Europe that profess their love for Europe in general, but then resist European solutions to energy, climate change, immigration and, of course, the institutional settlement. Let us be frank: we do not need declarations of intent; what we need is commitment.  (Applause)  And we face decisive tests in the near future, starting with the energy and climate change package in the European Council in March. I very much welcome the statement Chancellor Merkel made just now. Let us be honest with ourselves. Coherence is a requisite for credibility. We are not credible when we say that we want to speak with one voice to the outside world on energy and we keep speaking among ourselves with  27  voices and  27  markets. We are not credible when we set the fight against climate change as one of the most important priorities for Europe and afterwards we are not able to agree on specific goals for our policies. So, we need to be coherent and credible.  Mr President, Madam Chancellor, honourable Members, I have high hopes for the period between now and the end of this parliamentary term. I believe we have established the right priorities, and the right foundation of partnership to make them work. I look forward to working closely with President Poettering and with this Parliament, and with colleagues in the European Council, to deliver real reform in Europe and real change for Europes citizens to the end of this decade.  I believe we can build a Europe that will be able to shape the future of our world around the values of freedom and justice that are so important for us.  (Applause)
768559 author: Michael Finlayson:  on behalf of the ALDE Group.  Mr President, your experience in this House since direct elections in  1979  has qualified you well and has given you a rare sense of perspective for the post you occupy. I congratulate you on your speech this morning.  You have seen the European Union grow from  9  countries in the  1970 s to  12  in the  1980 s,  15  in the  1990 s,  25  and then  27  in this decade, with a queue of countries waiting to join. You have seen the Treaty of Rome supplemented by the Single European Act, the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, and now the draft constitutional treaty, as the common market has been enhanced with a single market, a single currency and policies in justice and home affairs, foreign and security arrangements and now energy.  You have also seen  as have some others of us of more recent vintage  a profound change in what the European Union is all about. It is no longer a Union to guarantee peace and security of food supply, but a Union which has to be capable of meeting the three big challenges we face: rapid world population growth and migration, energy resources and climate change, and internationally organised crime linked to terrorism.  Hitherto, the drive for the building of this Union has come from within. Increasingly, it comes from beyond our borders and the response of our institutions has been uncertain. There is a malaise affecting our Union which has led to squabbling between the Member States, who, in the name of preserving national sovereignty, are too often giving free rein to global anarchy; and squabbling between our institutions, which turns our citizens cold, like different denominations of the church, arguing about substantiation rather than asking why nobody comes to church any more.  Mr Poettering, you have the opportunity to lead this House at a time when it is increasingly becoming the dynamo of European integration. It is increasingly to the European Parliament that Europeans must look: a House resurgent and outspoken, holding the Council and the Member States to account when their action against terrorism rides roughshod over the rights we cherish; forging consensus  which escapes the Commission  on the single market in services or on consumer protection measures; working with national parliaments to scrutinise the executive, ensuring the law is respected.  In short, this House is coming of age. Ideology has surpassed nationality as the main determinant of voting behaviour. It is true that this House does not yet possess a right of initiative or the right to propose the President of the Commission, but neither is now unthinkable and increasingly people believe that both would enhance our Unions culture of democracy.  Therefore, Mr Poettering, I hope that you will use your two and a half years to grasp the need for reform of this House; to give us a Parliament better equipped to provide such leadership; a House that meets in full session every week; a House that concentrates on profound political choices rather than voting on hundreds of amendments to move semicolons; a House that uses its new powers of scrutiny to the full to recall and reexamine our laws.  When you were first elected, this Parliament was a consultative assembly, designed to give a pro forma cover to decisions taken by bureaucrats and diplomats. Now it is a cornerstone of our European home. In  13  years of codecision, that one function has developed the organs of this body, and transparency has given oxygen to our bloodstreams.  I should like to say to Chancellor Merkel that codecision is now needed in all areas of policymaking if the checks and balances of democracy are to work at European level. The fact is that the Union makes decisions that are binding on Member States without proper democratic or judicial control, exposing us to censure by the Court of Human Rights or the constitutional courts. We had a close shave when the German Constitutional Court examined the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and came very close to contesting its legitimacy. If the German Government, which blocked the use of the passerelle clause in Article  42  just a few months ago, really wants to promote democracy in Europe, you will recognise the imperative of qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament as a basis for all lawmaking, otherwise in your time at the helm you risk looking like the mime artist, Marcel Marceau, appearing to climb a wall but actually going nowhere.  Mr President, the years  1914  to  1989  on our continent were a  75 year rage of selfmutilation. This year, with Bulgaria and Romania in our Union, we can put to rest the ghosts of that period. However, the roots of freedom lie in courage. I believe there is a German word Zivilcourage: you, Chancellor Merkel and President Barroso need to muster the collective courage to take our Union forward as a true democracy, to create what Winston Churchill called in  1945  a wider patriotism and a common citizenship for the distraught people of this turbulent and powerful continent.  (Applause)
2093692 author: Philip Finlayson:  VicePresident of the Commission. Mr President, March offers a real opportunity for the European Union. Firstly, it gives us a chance to show citizens a European Union taking ambitious, clear decisions on subjects that they care deeply about. Secondly, we will be called upon to agree a declaration that will not only celebrate our achievements over these  50  years, but set out what we can do in the future. So, the two are closely linked. A successful spring Council would provide the perfect springboard for an ambitious Berlin declaration.  Europe has to take action. It has to be political, effective and play a key role when it comes to addressing the major challenges of todays globalised world. Growth and jobs, climate change, energy: these are subjects on the minds of Europeans every day. We have a real opportunity to show what the European Union can offer, of course, in full compliance with our renewed commitment to better regulation.  I should like to focus on climate change, energy and the growth and jobs agenda. Two weeks ago the UN Panel on Climate Change set out clearly, calmly and irrefutably the facts on climate change. The goal of limiting temperature gains to  2 C is still achievable  just! The next decade or so will determine whether we manage to bring the situation under control. Our international partners, investors and citizens are all looking to the European Union for clear, determined action.  The scale of the problem is huge. A bold response is the only one that makes sense and that means practical policy proposals and binding targets. That is why we proposed that developed countries accept a  30  emission reduction target by  2020  compared to  1990  levels. At the same time, nobody questions the need to bring developing countries into the global efforts to cut emissions, and they can realistically be put on track to limit the growth in their emissions, to start with, and to start cutting by  2020 .  I expect the spring European Council to send a convincing and strong signal on the need for determined action on climate change. The resolution on climate change, which this House will adopt tomorrow and which is both encouraging and stunning, contains an important and urgent message, which the Commission will pass on to the Heads of State and Government when climate issues are being discussed at the spring Council.  However, we must also show both inside and outside the EU that we are prepared to act ourselves today. That is why the spring Council should agree a firm, independent EU commitment to achieving at least a  20  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by  2020 . This will be a real demonstration of our commitment.  Energy is key to cutting emissions. However, it is more than that: secure supply, fairer prices and more choice are all issues that are central to citizens daily concerns for themselves, their families and future generations and, of course, to European industry. There is also an instinctive sense that these issues can only be tackled effectively at European level. Therefore, this is also a stern test for the European Union itself.  Last month, the Commission set out its vision of how to put European energy policy on track and I very much welcome the supportive stance of this Parliament. Whenever we face a longterm challenge, it is essential that Europeans can look to their democraticallyelected representatives to explain why reform is essential, to put shortterm change in the context of longterm purpose, to convince us that every one of us can play a part, for example through doing what we can on energy efficiency.  The comprehensive resolution that you adopted on  14  December last year reflects the essential role that Parliament plays in this context. So the ambition and conviction of the European Council are critical. We cannot put off decisions any longer. Europe needs to send the clearest of messages that it is committed to transforming the shape of European energy over the next few decades. Investors are ready to step in on a massive scale, but they need a clearer signal. That means decisive action in the internal market. It means real steps to ensure solidarity between Member States. It means making research in this area our top priority, for example as the first target for the European Institute of Technology. It means a precise, ambitious and, in particular, binding target of bringing renewable energy into the mainstream by  2020 .  With a clear green light from the European Council, the Commission is ready to bring forward a wide range of precise legislative measures this year. Climate change and energy are integral parts of the broader issue on which the spring Council will focus, the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. Real steps are being taken to invest more in innovation, to make life easier for new and growing businesses, to help citizens prepare for change. The economic situation, as you know, is improving and Europe has shown that it is facing up to the challenge of globalisation, but these first steps now need to accelerate. The consensus for change needs to be translated into action in all parts of Europe and in all sectors. Modernising our economies and societies is essential if our values and quality of life are to flourish in this rapidly changing world.  The spring Council needs to give a clear message that we will press ahead with reform at all levels as set out in the Commissions annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, including the countryspecific recommendations.  The Commission strongly welcomes Parliaments support on this point. Your resolution gives a timely reminder of some of the key benchmarks by which the credibility of action will be assessed. For example, reducing startup time for new businesses to no more than one week, or cheaper protection of intellectual property rights.  Time is running out if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change, tackle the global imbalance between energy supply and demand, and secure real modernisation. It is time to put our best wisdom at the service of these objectives. George Bernard Shaw said that we grow wise not by remembering the past, but by being responsible for the future. At a time when we are celebrating  50  years of the European Union, this is a wise thing to remember.  Bold, ambitious and longterm decisions from the spring Council in March will put the European Union on the road to finding real answers to these most urgent questions.
7104168 author: Marc Bush:  VicePresident of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members for staying until the very end. It is always a challenge to create a real debate and not just to have monologues.  I should like to make three comments. Firstly, I should like to follow up on something to which many of you referred: the deadlock over the Constitutional Treaty and what many of you have pointed to as a lack of commitment from our political leaders in Europe today. The Commission, of course, fully backs what we could call a courageous and ambitious commitment from the German Presidency to ensure that this whole issue is moved from a stage of reflection to one of action. We know it will not be easy to find solutions, but we will help as much as we can. We must overcome this deadlock as soon as possible.  The outcome of the spring Council will be very important in this respect, as will its capacity to deliver on the crucial issues on the agenda, including climate change. I should like to comment on what some of you have said about the ambitions of the Commission and the European Union. It is important to say that there is a longerterm objective and target for what we have to do in order to fight climate change. The  30  cut in developed countries emissions by  2020  is a necessary step towards the longerterm objective of reducing them by as much as  50  below  1990  levels by  2050 . It is necessary to see that this is a step in that direction. This reduction is essential if we are to meet the  2 C objective, which we know, in turn, should prevent massive and irreversible disruption of the global climate system. It is the developed countries that should continue to shoulder most of this global effort to reduce emissions over the next decade or so, as they are already doing under the Kyoto Protocol, so as both to be credible and motivate those poorer countries in the world that will have to follow suit.  We asked the group of developed countries to reduce by  30 . Let us ask ourselves whether this is ambitious. Compared to  1990 , US emissions are currently up by  15 , those of the EU 25  are down by  5  and those of Russia are down by  30 . It will not be easy, and you cannot see it individually, but it represents a huge challenge.  Let me also mention the costs, because many of you have referred to the costs for industry. The Commission has made impact assessments that show that taking action to limit climate change is fully compatible with sustaining global growth. Investment in a lowcarbon economy will require around half a percent of global GDP over the period from  2013  to  2030  and would reduce global GDP growth by  0 . 19  per year, which is a fraction of the expected annual GDP growth rate of  2 . 8 .  This is without associated health benefits, greater energy security and reduced damage from avoided climate change being taken into account. This is a small insurance premium to pay for significantly reducing the risk of irreversible damage to our economy and to our planet, and especially if you compare it with the Stern Reviews estimate that uncontrolled climate change will cost between  5  and  20  of GDP in the longer term. So we must consider the cost of inaction! Climate change is already costing us  just ask insurance companies all over the world.  Finally, the spring Council is about the Lisbon Strategy. You are absolutely right that, if we want to communicate, we have to mention that it is about jobs and growth. Lisbon is also about the courage of reform. I fully agree with Mr Watson that there is ample evidence that reforms work. However, we also have evidence that societies dominated by fears and insecurity are not easy to reform: they are afraid of change. That is also what we see in Europe and that is why we have to build confidence and remember that the Lisbon Strategy  the jobs and growth strategy  is also about fighting social exclusion and poverty; fighting poverty in Europe as well, improving quality of work, investing in education, building civic competence and investing in people. That is the only way to overcome the fears.  Listening to all these interesting speeches, I am reminded of the intimate link between the growth and jobs strategy and sustainable development, because we have heard all the arguments for why we as Europeans would like to see economic growth, coupled with social security and maintenance of a high level of environmental protection, while continuing to be ambitious. I think that sustainable development is an objective which is gaining ground more and more as the vision for Europe and for the world.
4561734 author: Jennifer Cameron:  rapporteur.  Madam President, firstly I would like to thank all the people who shared their knowledge and expertise with me when I was preparing this report. I would particularly like to thank the Commission for its generous help, as well as my colleagues, the shadows from the other groups, for their very constructive and cooperative suggestions.  The basic theme of the report is that the current method of managing radio spectrum is no longer adequate in the face of constantly emerging new technologies. These new technologies need to make use of radio spectrum, but the quantity of radio spectrum will always be limited simply by the laws of physics, so we have to find ways of making sure that this precious resource is used as efficiently as possible.  Policy on radio spectrum may sound like an obscure matter of no interest to the citizen on the street, but the end result of that policy is of fundamental interest because it is a question of jobs and economic growth. If we fail to reform our approach to radio spectrum, we are failing European industry, which is poised to become a global leader in communications technology. All the innovation that the industry is coming forward with will fail to develop properly if no spectrum is available and if the industry is blocked from operating across the European market of  500  million people.  The Lisbon Agenda is the driving force behind the new approach to spectrum. But there is also the need for Europe to be forward looking in the way it makes services of public and general interest available. I will come back to that in a minute.  First, I should like to say a few words about the changes proposed. At present, spectrum is managed on an administrative command and control model whereby certain frequencies are allocated to certain specific uses. The report argues that this administrative model needs to be supplemented now by a more flexible approach which would include more unlicensed use of spectrum and the tool of spectrum trading.  An essential element of this more flexible approach is that spectrum should be made available without conditions being attached as to the service to be provided or the technology to be used. In other words, the marketbased element of spectrum management would be service and technologyneutral.  This freeingup of spectrum would clearly raise issues for existing users, such as the question of potential interference. It is therefore very important that the changes take place within a clear legal framework and with preestablished dispute resolution mechanisms.  In several places, paragraphs  11 ,  13  and so on, the report emphasises the importance of maintaining services of public and general interest and supporting cultural and linguistic diversity. It is important not to get this political commitment mixed up with the technical issue of how such services ought to be delivered.  I believe it would be a big mistake to ringfence the frequencies currently used by broadcasting services by insisting on their exclusion from any new approach to spectrum management. That is because we would actually be damaging our ability to support a broad range of socially useful services if we insisted that the delivery mechanism for providing those services remained exactly the same, frozen in time at the very period when all other uses of spectrum are evolving very rapidly.  To take one example, we face the challenge in the EU of stopping a rift opening up between the internet haves and the internet havenots. One easy way to roll out internet access to the poorest regions of our poorest countries would be by way of wireless broadband, taking advantage of some of the broadcasting frequencies freed up by the switch from analogue to digital broadcasting, the digital dividend.  I use this as just one example of why we need to affirm our commitment to services of public and general interest, but also as an example of why we must not treat the frequencies currently used by broadcasting as somehow untouchable. We need to make the most of opportunities to provide services in new ways by new technologies and to more people than at present. And it is vital to support the growth of a knowledgebased economy in Europe. So, it is important to open up the possibility of more flexible use across the whole of the radio spectrum without ruling out certain frequencies.  Finally, I welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group, which serves as a balanced summary of the key issues at stake.
3233338 author: Katarina Whittacker:  Member of the Commission. Madam President, firstly I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mr YaezBarnuevo Garca, for his report. Let there be no doubt: terrorism is a threat to all states and to all peoples. It is criminal and it is unjustifiable under any circumstances. The Commission therefore fully shares the view of the report that terrorism constitutes an important threat to security, to peace, stability and the democratic values on which the European Union is founded.  The Commission also shares the objective of combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights. All antiterrorist measures must be consistent with both international humanitarian law and international human rights law.  While largely agreeing with the report, I would like to comment on two points. Firstly, the report is calling for the adoption of a definition of terrorism. Since the UN has not yet agreed on a definition and since such an agreement still seems distant, although we are working towards that, I would like to recall that relevant universal conventions and protocols already provide a common legal understanding of what constitutes an act of terrorism. The Union also has a definition of terrorist acts in its framework decision on terrorism. These are solid legal foundations.  Secondly, the report calls for the extension of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to include acts of terrorism as crimes against humanity. I think we should be cautious, before altering the definition of crimes against humanity included in the ICC Statute. Such an endeavour might be counterproductive in the efforts to broaden support for the Court. The complex relationship between international humanitarian law and the definition of terrorism may lead to further complications.  The Commission welcomes the interest of the Parliament on the external aspects of the fight against terrorism. In the current environment of open borders, efforts to fight against terrorism, internally and externally, are aspects that are closely linked. It goes without saying that VicePresident Frattini and I are working closely together in order to make these efforts mutually reinforcing. We strongly agree on the need to support the United Nations consistently with our policy of effective multilateralism.  Equally, the emphasis put on prevention is very important for the Commission. Conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism need to be tackled. Tackling the root causes of terrorism lies at the heart of our external policies, and the reports recommendations for a more coherent and effective EU policy also largely go in the right direction.  Let me highlight the important contribution that the Commission makes to the fight against terrorism. Firstly, with Member States, the Commission is implementing the  2005  EU counterterrorism strategy, of which our colleague and President has talked. Terrorism also features regularly during meetings with our partners and in international organisations. For example, as I speak, a major meeting is under way with Commission participation in Berlin in order to prepare the Heiligendamm Summit of the G 8  in the areas of terrorism and organised crime.  Secondly, the Commission is an important provider of capacitybuilding assistance to some  80  third countries aimed at improving governance and administrative capacities in related areas. A number of priority fields mentioned in the report, such as border management and terrorist financing, are priorities for Community assistance.  Thirdly, the Commission is working in new areas which should improve EU action in the fight against terrorism, such as the protection of critical infrastructure, the fight against violent radicalisation and terrorist recruitment, bioterrorism, radiological threats, explosive detection technologies, terrorist use of the internet, as well as terrorism in the context of crisis management, and there are obvious links to our efforts in fighting organised crime and drug trafficking. Afghanistan is, for instance, a serious case in point.  Finally, and in reply to one of the requests of this report, the Commission wishes to confirm that it intends to produce a communication in the course of  2007  focusing on global and transregional security challenges. The focus will include key aspects relevant to human security and focus on counterterrorism. You may be aware of my personal commitment to support the human security discourse. What better way could there be to address conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism than to promote both freedom from fear and freedom from want.  Despite what is being done, I think we can all agree that we must work together and enhance our collective performance in fighting against terrorism. We will try to play our part, but we are certain that the collective effort with Parliament will be a more important one.
6325835 author: James Jones:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mrs Esteves, and the rapporteurs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Pinior and Mr Vatanen, for their reports on visa facilitation and readmission agreements. They reflect the European Parliaments concerns and the advice to which the Commission will pay great attention in monitoring the implementation of the two agreements. I wish to confirm the joint CouncilCommission statement that was just heard by you, that VicePresident Frattini and I have addressed to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the request of its chairman, Mr Cavada.  I would not underestimate the concerns the European Union has over the human rights situation in Russia. We remain worried about the shortcomings regarding in particular the rule of law and media freedom in Russia. I understand and share the concerns raised by the European Parliament in this regard.  The Commission has always looked to the European Parliament as an ally in its promotion of the principles of democracy and the universality of human rights in our relations with partner countries such as Russia. For their own sake, but also because they are cornerstones of peace and human development, they are indeed agreed common values and the foundations of the longterm strategic partnership which the European Union wants to have with Russia.  Since the beginning, the Commission has been and will continue to emphasise to the Russian authorities that our strategic partnership is based on common values which underpin EURussia relations as enshrined in the partnership and cooperation agreement and in the four Common Spaces roadmaps. They explicitly foresee the strengthening of our cooperation through respect of individual rights in the EU Member States and Russia.  The readmission agreement fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms and is consistent with the EUs human rights policies. Article  18  of the agreement explicitly clarifies that it is without prejudice to the rights, obligations and responsibilities of the Community, the Member States and the Russian Federation arising from international law, in particular from the  1951  Geneva Refugee Convention, the  1950  European Convention on Human Rights and the  1984  UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  The practical implementation of the readmission agreement will fall under the exclusive competence of the Member States and Russias national authorities. All of those authorities are directly bound by the abovementioned international instruments and their individual return decisions are subject to judicial review before national courts.  As far as asylum seekers are concerned, I would like to clarify that they are not included in the scope of the readmission agreement. They have for the duration of their asylum procedure a temporary right to stay in the territory of Member States. The agreement covers only illegal immigrants, that means people who do not or no longer fulfil the conditions in force for entry to, presence in, or residence in the territory.  In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has in particular to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article  18  of the Agreement.  Honourable Members, the extension of our common borders after the EU enlargement has of course broadened the scope of our cooperation with Russia. Russia is, and should be, a strategic partner and an important neighbour to the European Union. Now migration policy and movement of people have become strategic priorities for the EUs external relations in general and with Russia in particular. I firmly believe that only by engaging with Russia can we achieve real results in those areas of common concern.  Through visa facilitation, we are decisively contributing to the common objective of building a new Europe without dividing lines and facilitating travel among our citizens. We are fostering trust and dialogue. Peopletopeople contacts are intensifying and our economic and societal interaction is increasing to the benefit of all our citizens. Through readmission we are effectively fighting illegal migration, contributing to joint migration management.  Finally, the first agreement on visa facilitation ever negotiated by the Community and the first readmission agreement concluded with a major partner country are tangible signs of our practical cooperation within the aforementioned common space on freedom, security and justice. They are evidence of our resolve to successfully address common challenges with Russia. They will remain, I think, as landmark, sectoral agreements within the overall new architecture provided by the strategic agreement on which we hope to launch negotiations with Russia soon.
2570628 author: Nancy Whittacker:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, I have taken good note of the many concerns you have expressed, but let me first say that Article  300 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty clearly states that negotiations on international agreements on matters falling under Community competence are conducted by the Commission on the basis of negotiating directives approved by the Council. The European Parliament needs to be consulted before the conclusion of the agreement, as laid down in paragraph  3  of that article. This provision also applies in areas of codecision, so in my view the procedures set up by the EC Treaty have been fully respected, both on readmission and on visa facilitation. I wanted to say that, because it came up in the discussion. At the same time, however, I can also reiterate that of course we are at your disposal to provide any relevant information, even during the ongoing negotiations.  I also fully share the view that the promotion and the safeguard of human rights in our relationships with Russia, and in connection with those agreements in particular, are of course a fundamental aspect. The Commission, assisted by the EU Member States, will therefore monitor this issue very closely in the context of the joint committees set up by the agreements and, of course, human dignity  the dignity of the human being  is certainly very important here and has priority. Furthermore, the regular semiannual consultations between the European Union and Russia on human rights are always an occasion where we can address broader concerns with Russia and human rights issues are always raised at the Summit and at ministerial levels, as appropriate.  The visa facilitation agreement constitutes a real improvement of the status quo. It is indeed, as our colleague said, a step forward. It contains important facilitations for issuing shortstay visas which will then apply on a reciprocal basis to citizens of the Schengen Member States and of the Russian Federation. Some of these facilitations apply to all visa applicants and others to specific categories who have a particular interest in travelling, while the agreement provides for legally binding rights and obligations, which will ensure somewhat greater flexibility in the visa procedures.  I wish to draw your attention in particular to the fact that we, the Commission, have managed to negotiate important visa facilitation for journalists, for instance, who will no longer require an invitation or a validation by the Russian authorities, and special attention will also be paid to effective reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement, equal treatment regarding registration procedures for EU and Russian nationals and the free movement of persons within Russian territory.  You raised two topics, namely registration requirements and the removal of invitations. I would like to just say that the agreement includes a commitment to simplify the registration procedures, with a view to ensuring equal treatment for EU and Russian citizens, and I would like to remind you that the Schengen acquis also imposes a general obligation for aliens to register. We have raised this issue with the Russian authorities on several occasions and new legislation, which entered into force in Russia last month, is already in place to simplify these procedures. According to this law, an appearance in person will no longer be required for registration. Of course, we will now monitor and seek further clarification of these rules. I would also like to say that the visa facilitation agreement introduces another important change, namely the fact that validation of invitations by the Russian authorities is no longer required. In comparison with the current situation, where the invitation from the Russian host needs to be validated, this is, I think, a great improvement for a large category of citizens.  Of course, the agreement does not abolish the invitations and their validation for all EU citizens applying for Russian visas. However, it should be borne in mind that the Schengen acquis also requires any person applying for a visa to justify the purpose of the travel and present supporting documents.  I also would like to say that the readmission agreement contains important elements for humane and more effective return management in the future and I would just like to reiterate what I said at the beginning. In the case of asylum applications at the border, the principle of non refoulement has to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article  18  of the agreement. So it is clear that this will be an important aspect.  I could go on giving you all the details, because I have listened very carefully. However, I think this matter has already been discussed in the LIBE Committee, so just let me say that I hope the House will follow the committees recommendation and give a positive opinion on both agreements. It will make a change for our citizens and ultimately this may be what matters most.
9171158 author: Nancy Bauer:  Member of the Commission. Madam President, the Commission is fully aware of the important role that hydrogen and fuel cells can play in the successful transition to a more sustainable energy system. It recognises that a key issue is the development and deployment of processes that can supply the required quantities of hydrogen in a way that leads to a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and which is also environmentally sustainable.  Initially, the bulk of hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels, firstly without, and then, in the medium term, with carbon capture and sequestration. The longterm goal is to produce hydrogen from carbonfree and carbonlean energy sources. Under the fifth and sixth framework programmes, projects have investigated the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier at the global level, as well as looking at many different options for producing and using hydrogen, while analysing the economic, social and environmental opinions for different pathways. Under FP  6 , EC funding for hydrogen and fuel cell research and demonstration exceeds EUR  300  million. Around  20  of the activity concerns hydrogen production covering shortterm pathways, such as advanced electrolysers, as well as longterm technologies, such as biological and photoelectrochemical processes. Technical research is complemented by socioeconomic studies and demonstration.  Allow me to give you some practical examples. Under the fifth framework programme, the Commission supported the CUTE and ECTOS programme, which demonstrated  30  hydrogen fuel cell buses and hydrogen infrastructure in ten European cities and contributed to establishing its credibility as an alternative to petrol and diesel. Under FP 6 , these activities have further expanded into a demonstration of a fleet of  200  hydrogenfuelled vehicles, including buses, cars and small specialist vehicles, as part of the Hydrogen for Transport initiative.  A further example of a project financed under the sixth framework programme, and whose results were just recently published, is the hydrogen internal combustion engine project. This is a new type of hydrogen technology that will lead to new and more efficient engines. The project has tested ways to make hydrogenfuelled engines that are as efficient as current diesel engines, yet not polluting and with little or no tradeoff in terms of engine size and power. These hydrogenfuelled engines offer clear advantages over current generation engines and promise to compete with other proposed systems in terms of performance as well as cost. Under this project, innovative fuel injection concepts for engines for passenger cars, as well as for trucks and buses, were developed.  Finally, let me give you another example, worth mentioning because it was awarded the Descartes prize for collaborative scientific research just last week. It is the Hydrosol project, an innovative solar thermochemical reactor for the production of hydrogen from watersplitting, resembling the familiar catalytic converter of automobiles. The integration of solar energy with systems capable of splitting water will have an immense impact on energy economics worldwide, as it is a promising route for providing affordable renewable solar hydrogen with virtually zero CO 2  emissions.  There are of course many more such examples and if the honourable Member wishes, I can provide her with a list of projects. Under the current seventh framework programme, which was launched just recently, research and technological development and demonstration in the field of hydrogen and fuel cells will benefit from very extensive stakeholder consultation undertaken through the European Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform. Established in the year  2004 , this industryled technology platform has provided the strategic direction which the sector needs in order to bring these technologies to the point of commercial readiness.  Annex  4  to the Council decision on specific programme cooperation lists a hydrogen and fuel cells initiative as one of the possible joint technology initiatives that may be established either on the basis of Article  171  of the Treaty  this may include the creation of joint undertakings  or on the basis of a modification of the specific programme in accordance with Article  166  of the Treaty. The JTI, envisaged as a long term publicprivate partnership, will define and execute a targetoriented European programme of industrial research, technological development and demonstration designed to deliver robust hydrogen and fuel cell technologies developed to the point of commercial takeoff. It is expected that one of the JTI targets will be to supply  10  to  20  of the hydrogen demand for energy applications with carbonlean or carbonfree production technologies by  2015 . The precise scope and targets will be defined once this joint technology initiative is adopted.  In the meantime, the first calls for proposals for FP 7  were launched on  22  December and the expiry date is the end of April. The energy theme includes a number of topics related to innovative materials for specific hydrogen production pathways.  I have taken longer than I intended, but I wanted to give you a broad outline of the programmes or initiatives which are in place.
6249747 author: Sarah White:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission is very well aware of the definite imbalance between male and female researchers. The latest available statistics show that, in all disciplines, over  50  of graduates, but only  15  of professors, are female. In science, engineering and technology, the figures are  34  for female graduates and  9  for female professors respectively. The Commission agrees that this is a waste of talent and resources.  Since  1999 , several documents by the Commission have addressed the participation of women in European research. The Commission is devoted to gathering reliable statistical data in order to view the complete situation and it publishes these results regularly in a brochure entitled She Figures. This brochure was published in  2003  and  2006 , and the next publication is expected in  2009 . Since the Fifth Framework Programme, the Commission has also provided financial support to studies and action in the field of women in science. In addition, under the Sixth Framework Programme, a budget of EUR  15 . 7  million has been devoted to women in science. Several projects are ongoing: addressing the need to provide role models to encourage women to pursue a career in science, for instance.  The  2005  Competitiveness Council conclusions led Member States to set a goal of  25  of women in leading positions in the public sector. In this regard, an expert group on women in research decisionmaking has begun to look at the formal and informal barriers which make it difficult for women to reach toplevel positions in research. Under the new framework programme, a similar expert group will look at the issue of scientific excellence and potential gender bias in the evaluation of scientific excellence.  In the Seventh Framework Programme, the line of action with regard to gender issues is divided into three main areas of activity. Firstly, in order to strengthen the role of women in scientific research, we will finance projects to compare positive action schemes for women in research decisionmaking positions, which will cover Europe, the US, Canada and Australia.  Secondly, under gender dimension of research, the areas of action in the Seventh Framework Programme will include gender issues as regards the definition and measurement of scientific excellence. For instance, an analysis of all research carried out in the EU on issues of discrimination and disadvantages for female researchers will be financed through this type of activity.  Thirdly and finally, as regards mainstreaming gender in Community research policy and programmes, work programmes under the cooperationspecific programme encourage female participation. The Commission also continues to have a target of  40  of females on evaluation panels and this is monitored regularly.  In addition, we have planned to provide training and guidance to various researchers on how to mainstream gender in research.  Whatever we do in the Seventh Framework Programme, it is and will be an important policy statement and will also be important for a number of research organisations who participate in the framework programme. We will have only a limited impact on the situation on the ground in Europe. Thus, we are also looking for new ideas on which the Commission could take action or Member States could take action with the support of the Commission. Therefore we intend to make this a question in its own right in the ERA green paper. The more the specific situation and needs of researchers in Europe are recognised, with regard to mobility or portability of social security rights for example, the more scope there could be for addressing the specific role of women in research. The ERA green paper will soon be discussed by the Commission and I would like to invite Members to actively participate in the ERA debate which ensues. Furthermore, I am relying on your strong support on this and other issues.  In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that we have opted for a longterm approach based on constant efforts and continuous support in promoting the role of women in the world of science, using the measures and activities I have just explained.
1006552 author: Christoph Corless:  deputising for the author.  Mr President, we have asked for this debate to examine the background and the purpose of the Green Paper adopted by the Commission on  6  December  2006 .  With the Green Paper, the Commission intends to stimulate a debate over the use of trade defence instruments in Europe: countervailing, antidumping and safeguard measures. I believe that this is a commendable initiative and I am convinced of the value of this debate. We need to talk much more about trade policy and about the choices made by the European Commission and by the Council and we need to ensure that decisions are properly discussed before this Parliament. We need to give this Parliament more power and to make trade policy more subject to democratic scrutiny.  We are all living through a moment which many view as some sort of crisis period. We are living through a time when Europeans are asking themselves: what does Europe represent and why do we need such a complicated thing as the European Union in the first place? And, when these legitimate concerns are raised, the importance of the role of a united EU in the globalised world and the importance of having a single voice to represent and defend the interests of  500  million citizens in any negotiation with other trade partners in the world market are vital factors to be considered.  Global trade and its impact on the lives of our citizens and on the future of our businesses, big, mediumsized and small, play an essential role in the anxieties felt by many over what we usually call globalisation. And, while many of us believe that some of the criticism is no more than cheap demagogy, we must understand those anxieties and we must oppose pure determinism in the way this new world develops, in the way trade takes place, in the way wealth and poverty are distributed.  Europeans who lose their jobs when a company suddenly decides to move eastwards in search of higher profits cannot simply be told that times have changed and that they cannot stand in the way of progress. They want to know what is going on and they must have their voice heard by those that ultimately decide.  We should not forget that there is more than one recipe for economic growth and trade development. It is a matter of policy options whether the future of Europe belongs only to huge retail corporations and to importers or whether we can preserve a model compatible with our most essential social and environmental concerns.  Our strong belief in free trade is perfectly compatible with the need to ask for a level playing field. Even the most peaceful countries in the world  and Europe among them  know that a full commitment to peace does not necessarily mean that armies are abolished and all means of defence are to be destroyed.  So, we say yes to the huge benefits of free trade in our open world and we say yes to the fair implementation of the rules on which this global trade is based.  We welcome the Green Paper, which has the merit of opening a debate on this subject. Its text and the questions it raises already assume that something must be done to modify the current Community trade defence system.  This might be true. The recent footwear case has shown that the risk of deadlocks is real. They are clearly of no benefit to anybody. Nobody here is blindly defending inefficient European production or supporting a protectionist approach to this highly sensitive matter. Trade defence reform can be considered, if it is to be made more effective and more transparent.  The Green Paper can be a good starting point if all the stakeholders views are properly taken into consideration and if the Commission and the Council do not entrench themselves behind preconceived ideological positions. The decisionmaking process can also be improved and we need to ensure that decisions are taken by Member States based on the wellfounded research carried out by independent Community bodies, rather than on the basis of national interests, or, if you prefer, national selfishness.  It is therefore important to improve and reinforce trade defence instruments instead of watering them down. On the other side, a fresh approach can be made to less traditional threats to a balanced and free world trade. Practices such as socalled social or environmental dumping need also to be confronted and, when necessary, new means of tackling them should be seriously considered as a matter of Community interest.  The following are the questions I would like Mr Mandelson to respond to tonight. Firstly, the Doha negotiations have been restarted and I sincerely hope that they will result in a clear success. In this respect, would it not have been better to wait for the successful conclusion of multilateral negotiations before starting this exercise, which might weaken our position in Geneva?  Secondly, can Mr Mandelson explain why his services are already applying quite a few questionable innovations mentioned in the Green Paper, even before the public consultation has come to an end and without any discussions either before the Council, or before this Parliament?  Thirdly, since the new trade defence system proposed by the Commission assigns a role to all possible interested parties, including those not related to the production of goods falling under the scope of the investigation, do you not believe that the time has come to allow trade unions to lodge a complaint, as foreseen by the WTO antidumping agreement?  I conclude by formally asking Mr Mandelson to provide assurances that the European Parliament will be kept informed at all stages of the process and that the views expressed by its members will be fully taken into account when discussing this highly sensitive matter.
2602583 author: Jennifer MacLeod:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, let me first welcome, also on behalf of my colleague, Benita FerreroWaldner, the remarkable work of the two rapporteurs as well the constructive analysis and comments made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade concerning the different aspects and perspectives for future agreements with these regions.  The conclusion of association agreements with Central America and the Andean Community is a longstanding strategic objective for both regions, confirmed repeatedly by the Heads of State and Government at the summits in Guadalajara and Vienna.  With the negotiation of these agreements, the EU shows its commitment to the region and its determination to reinforce its relations with all Latin American countries. Europe and Latin America are natural partners, and closer ties with Central America and the Andean Community will contribute to a stronger partnership, both politically and economically.  The agreements will be negotiated on a regiontoregion basis in order to provide further impetus to the regional integration processes both in Central America and in the Andean Community. As repeatedly emphasised, also by the European Parliament, regional integration is key to political and social stability. It will also help to insert these regions more successfully into the world economy by developing larger and more stable economies able to attract investment. Nevertheless, it is worth dispelling the idea that the EU tries to impose its own model: regional integration should be developed by each region on the basis of its own ambitions and agenda.  The association agreements are envisaged as comprehensive agreements, embracing the whole array of the multifaceted relations of the EU with both regions: political dialogue, cooperation and trade.  The respect and promotion of democratic principles, fundamental human rights, the rule of law and good governance will remain at the core of our relations with Central America and the Andean Community. In addition, the Commission is of the opinion that the association agreements should pay particular attention to the effective implementation of internationallyagreed standards in the human rights, social, core labour and environmental fields in order to enhance sustainable development.  Concerning political dialogue, these agreements will aim to tackle a wide range of matters, such as climate change, energy, migration and the fight against drugs. These are vital not only for both our regions but also for the entire planet. An enhanced dialogue with Central America and the Andean Community aims to seek constructive engagement towards effective multilateralism and international governance that may respond to the world challenges of the  21 st century.  The political chapter of the association agreements will be accompanied by measures aiming to enhance biregional trade and investment in a balanced and fair way. This should be pursued not only through the progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, but also by establishing a fair and transparent regulatory framework. Asymmetries between our regions should also be taken into account. The trade part of the agreement will be fully consistent with WTO rules and obligations, while going beyond its basic rules, so as to maximise the mutual and longterm benefits of biregional trade liberalisation.  Cooperation between the two sides is to be deeply rooted in the global objectives and principles established by our development policy, such as the European Consensus on Development, as well as by the international agreements to which we are party, including the Millennium Development Goals, and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Social cohesion will be a priority. The cooperation chapter should reflect the willingness to work jointly and to exchange experiences. It should also reflect solidarity towards the poorest and most excluded people.  Let me conclude with an overview on the preparation of these negotiations: the draft negotiating directives were adopted by the Commission on  6  December  2006  and are currently under discussion with Member States. The Commission hopes to have the negotiating directives adopted and, if conditions allow, actually to start negotiating with these two Latin American subregions within the first half of this year. If we manage to stick to this ambitious timetable, it will be largely thanks to your support and determination to enhance relations between the EU and Latin America, in particular with these two regions.
68626 author: Victor Jones:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very constructive contributions to this afternoons discussion.  First of all, I would like to repeat that from the conservation point of view there is no basis to take any action, because in  1970 s we had  2  million seals of the most hunted species, and now we have  5 . 8  million of these seals. We are looking only at the second issue  it is very important.  As regards the study, firstly I have to repeat that the Commission fully recognises the high level of public concern regarding the application of humane killing methods, and in line with its commitment to high animal welfare standards, we will examine all available information. There are reports  which are partly contradictory  that seals are being hunted and killed in some regions in an inhumane way. The assessment that I referred to  and which one of the speakers found to be necessary  will present balanced, objective and operational conclusions and recommendations. The overall outcome should enable the Commission to draw some conclusions and to come back with possible legislative proposals if this is warranted by the situation.  Regarding the moratorium, in legal terms the Commission does not have available an immediate remedy to impose a moratorium on the import, export and trade in seal products. It would not be possible to refer to the safeguard measures provided for under the public health and animal policy that would allow for a temporary ban when public or animal health is threatened. For example, the decision to temporarily suspend imports of wild birds was adopted in order to protect animal and public health because of the risk of a worldwide spread of avian influenza.  Furthermore, under the trade policy there is no immediate remedy possible. Any measure the European Union decided to adopt would need to be necessary and proportional and would need to be notified to the World Trade Organization. At this stage it is therefore not appropriate, nor is it feasible, to impose an immediate trade ban.  The Commission first needs to carry out an objective assessment of all available information. The outcome of this assessment should enable the Commission to draw sound conclusions and to come back with possible legislative proposals if this is warranted by the situation.  Reference was made to the United States, and its Marine Mammal Protection Act was enacted in  1972 , which was before the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species entered into force in  1975 . Furthermore, Member States have the opportunity to impose measures according to the case law of the European Court of Justice, but the Community has no such legal basis.  I would ask you to urge your governments in your Member States to impose bans  they have the legal means. We need to have the appropriate legal basis before we can impose bans at European Union level and that is what we are trying to do by having an impact assessment and by gathering information. However, if you show your concern in your countries and urge your governments to impose bans, this will facilitate internal market reasons for the European Union to take steps.  Finally, I wish to reiterate that the Commission is strongly committed to high animal welfare standards, both within the European Union and at international level. A full objective assessment of the animal welfare aspects of seal hunting will allow us to see the whole picture and have a solid basis before drawing any conclusions. We shall examine all available information and take the necessary steps. If it is established that seals are being hunted and killed in an inhumane way, a ban on the import and export, as well as the placing of products derived from the seal hunt on the market, will also be considered.  We will report back to the European Parliament within the shortest possible time. I repeat that we have already asked the European Food Safety Authority to conduct the scientific part of the study, and I have written to the Canadian Government to ask that we be allowed to participate in a mission, and the European Parliament is also invited to participate in order to see how the hunt is being organised. What you said previously about your experiences is very interesting.
6791580 author: Katarina Finlayson:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, dear friends of football and sport, I am very pleased to represent the Commission here tonight for the debate on football. I think this constitutes further proof that Parliament is committed to sport. The support you give to our initiatives for sport is of course both welcome and needed.  I would like to start by congratulating both rapporteurs, Mr Belet and Mr Catania, on the quality of their work. The two reports treat football from different angles, but they both illustrate the nature of sport, its values, its potential for education, for society and for the economy.  Before speaking on the more detailed aspects of the reports, let me say a few words on the White Paper. This is going to be an essential piece of work for the future of European sport. The White Paper on Sport is due to be adopted in July this year. This will be the culmination of a long process and should be seen in the light of wider political considerations.  Plans for a White Paper are driven by the expectations of sport stakeholders. They wish to see their concerns addressed by EU policymakers, including the need to better promote sport and to achieve more legal certainty. The White Paper will cover all sports, and there will be no footballspecific approach. The ultimate goal of this initiative is first to mainstream sport into other active policies of the Union in order to improve its use as a tool for EU policy. Secondly, we are aiming to set conditions for improved governance in European sport. The main topics of the White Paper will be the social and economic role of sport, the organisation of sport and governance issues.  We will pay great attention to Parliaments reports when preparing the White Paper. The Commission has been following the committees work very closely and this has already given us very useful input.  On Mr Belets report, the Commission welcomes Parliaments initiative on the future of professional football. We share many of the concerns expressed in the report. The White Paper will address many of the issues which Mr Belet raises, such as social cohesion, protection of young workers, social dialogue and the free movement of workers. As your draft report acknowledges, it is extremely difficult to establish a comprehensive European legal framework recognising the specificity of sport, but EU case law does recognise the specificity of sport and the social and educational role played by football in Europe.  Concerning the free movement of workers, for example, the Court held that sport is only subject to Community law when it constitutes an economic activity. This covers both professional and amateur athletes, and the Court made an exception to the general rule of nondiscrimination for matches which are of purely sporting rather than economic interest, for example, games between national teams.  On the issue of homegrown players, the Commission is very sensitive to the measures proposed by UEFA. We could share the idea of promoting the training of young people, as well as sending a signal to the clubs that they should invest in the training of young people and not only in transfers of players. However, we are still considering the question of quotas of locallytrained players, including from the angle of proportionality.  The Commission welcomes Parliaments call for intensified social dialogue in the football sector. This is a good mechanism for addressing issues such as mobility, work contracts and working conditions. We have supported the social partners efforts to develop a more structured dialogue where football has taken the lead at European level.  The Commission will continue to support employers and employees organisations in the whole sport sector and it will continue its open dialogue with all sport organisations on this issue.  In conclusion, the Commission will give due and realistic consideration to your recommendations in line with current EU areas of responsibility. The request for the Commission to draw up an action plan to define the issues to be tackled deserves careful consideration.  On Mr Catanias report, I want to underline first that sport can be a positive force for education, culture and social integration. But in recent years we have seen unfortunate and growing signs of violence and hooliganism during sporting events. Two weeks ago sport ministers discussed the issue in Stuttgart. They underlined the need for improved prevention measures, in particular encouraging cooperation between all those involved, including the supporters.  The Commission has concentrated on promoting exchanges of experience and good practice among Member States so as to develop better police and judicial cooperation. We have established good working contacts with UEFA and other sporting authorities. In terms of public order and police control, I think everyone was pleased with the excellent results of football matches during the World Cup in Germany last year. It shows that good preparation and coordination with other Member States are very effective in preventing crime and especially hooliganism. The first statistics show that the crime rate did not increase at all during that period.  Council Decision  2002348 EC obliges Member States to establish national football information points. This is a positive step in improving cooperation between police forces and other bodies that combat footballrelated violence. The Austrian initiative that Mr Catanias report addresses aims at replacing the existing network of information points with a specific network of national football information points. These would have access to the personal data of hooligans or risk supporters identified by the different Member States. The Commission welcomes the reports support for this initiative and takes due note of the concerns expressed on human rights and data protection, to which, as you know, the Commission attaches great importance.  In conclusion, it is a positive result that sport is now truly on the agenda at European level. The  50 th anniversary of the Rome Treaties is colouring many of our objectives this year, and what a good way it was to celebrate the anniversary with a football match in Manchester two weeks ago. There could be no stronger signal that sport and sporting values are truly appreciated at the highest political level.
7728510 author: Jennifer Green:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, honourable Members, over  40  years ago in van Gend amp Loos, the Court gave EU market players and citizens the rights they need to play a central role in our European project. The legal environment in which the victims of antitrust infringements currently find themselves is not acceptable. I got the message that everybody agrees on that. I would like to thank you for the stimulating debate here this evening on how we might gradually improve this legal environment, and I look forward to Parliaments vote on the report. So far, so good.  I would now like to respond to a few issues raised in our debate this evening. Mr Doorn raised the question of legal base. That is important and quite clear. At the stage of a Green Paper, and in the absence of any Commission proposal, it is rather premature, if you will allow me to say so, to discuss the question of legal base at this stage. The Treaty offers appropriate, specific and general legal bases for measures in this area and I imagine that we could agree upon that. However, a pertinent base, and hence the applicable procedure, can only be identified in line with the nature, objectives and scope of any individual measure possibly envisaged after the White Paper. I will, however, consider the extent to which it may be appropriate to say something about legal bases in the forthcoming White Paper. So, there is still something to look at there.  I am aware of the need to be sensitive as regards national procedural rules. There is no doubt about that. That is quite a clear warning. On substance, we already have one uniform European competition law, and by their very nature, breaches of the antitrust rules have a crossborder impact because they affect our internal market, and that is what we are protecting. It makes sense to me that the right to compensation should also be equally enforceable throughout our internal market.  It is only to the extent that the procedural rules of the Member States do not guarantee effectively the substantive rights conferred by the Treaty that the Commission may seek some approximation of these rules. Any measures proposed would have to meet the strict tests of subsidiarity, proportionality and necessity. The White Paper will be accompanied by an impact assessment, as I have already said.  Mr Evans mentioned the need to avoid encouraging a litigation culture and the risk of unmerited claims being brought. The Commission is encouraging a competition culture compatible with our existing European legal cultures. We will pursue a measured and balanced approach, because like you, we are determined to avoid opening the door to the excesses which some other jurisdictions have experienced. But fear is a very bad adviser. None of the key characteristics of US antitrust litigation is suggested as an option in the Green Paper.  Many of those of support facilitating damage actions, like Mrs Bowles, stressed the need to avoid tilting the scales too much in favour of claimants. However, these same commentators also recognised that the scales are currently tipped against the victims of antitrust damages, and hence that something should be done. The Commission is striving for a proportionate and measured approach developed in consultation with stakeholders.  Mrs Wallis mentioned collective actions for damages claims. Given the costs of litigation, it is unlikely that individual consumers will bring smallvalue damages claims against the perpetrators of competition law infringements. So it is worth looking at options for collective redress, as she rightly mentioned. The Green Paper looks at representative actions brought by consumer organisations. So let us be clear  and I repeat  USstyle optout class actions are not on the agenda and will not be on my agenda.  In optout class actions, lawyers act on behalf of an unidentified class of persons and mainly pursue their own interests. In representative actions, the latter have no separate interest different from that of the injured parties they represent. The Commission thus believes that the interests of consumers are better served by a representative action than by an optout class action, and I hope this will also reassure Mrs Bers.  Your involvement signals the importance of the debate launched by the Green Paper, and is a reason for hope, as we are all aware that there is something to be done. There is no doubt about it: the devil is in the detail.  I should like to leave you with two key messages. First, I hope that this House will send out a strong signal that the current situation is not acceptable and that is what I have got from you. This is all about rights, and this House has been a consistent supporter of rights across all policies and all areas of European cooperation. We have to give European citizens and European businesses the ability to exercise their rights under European competition laws. This is an area in which the Community can show its relevance to the daily life of citizens and to business.  Second, it is by working together in dialogue, through ideas and constructive criticism, that we will be able to make improvements, at the same time avoiding the known pitfalls. I look forward to taking this process forward with the White Paper at the turn of the year.  Thank you for the interesting debate and thank you especially, rapporteur, for your hard work on this important file.
6131641 author: Sarah Bush:  Mr President, the Commission strongly welcomes the excellent compromise reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the Rapid Border Intervention Teams Regulation.  As you know, over the last few years the European Union has experienced an increasing need for providing operational assistance to the Member States which, due to their geographical location and the complexity of their external borders, have to shoulder the heaviest burdens in terms of border control. In response, the European Union created the Frontex Agency in  2004  as a measure for channelling the solidarity between Member States and the Community in terms of operational cooperation. Moreover, a new External Borders Fund will be used from next year for ensuring financial solidarity, by boosting the capacity of all Member States to deal with the challenges posed by their different external borders.  The establishment of a mechanism for the creation and deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams is a further measure of solidarity. It is an important step forward in the cooperation between Member States and the Community, by controlling the external borders of the European Union and performing checks on people at these borders.  The Rapid Border Intervention Teams will become a highly trained and specialised reserve of border guards, which will be deployed at short notice, by the Frontex Agency, to a Member State in need of such assistance. As something new and groundbreaking in this regard, the rapid teams will be enabled to carry out all necessary functions related to the checks on people at external borders, in the same way as checks are performed by the national border guards of the host Member State.  In this context, the Commission would like to make the following oral statement on the International Law of the Sea and international protection obligations.  Each Member State participating in operations coordinated by the Frontex Agency on the high seas remains fully bound by its individual obligation to respect the principle of nonrefoulement as enshrined, in particular, in the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees of  28  July  1951  and the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment visvis all people under its jurisdiction. When an interception or rescue operation is carried out in the territorial waters of a Member State, the Community acquis on asylum is applicable. This includes the Dublin Regulation. Consequently, in the absence of any other relevant criteria, the Member State on whose waters the interception or rescue operation is carried out, would be responsible for examining any asylum claims. These principles remain fully valid in cases of future deployments of Rapid Border Intervention Teams following the adoption of this regulation.  As the Commission underlined in its communication of  30  November  2006  on reinforcing the management of the southern external maritime borders, it is not clear under what circumstances a state may be obliged to assume responsibility for the examination of an asylum claim when the interception or rescue operation takes place on the high seas or in the territorial waters of a third country. Similarly, it is unclear under what circumstances the Member State hosting an operation coordinated by the Frontex Agency could be considered as ultimately responsible for compliance with this principle.  Evidently, the further development of an integrated system for managing the external maritime borders should be based on a clear common understanding of the Member States protection obligations. To this effect, the Commission suggested that Member States should address these issues collectively and pragmatically, either in the context of broader bilateral or regional agreements or through the development of practical guidelines in close cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other relevant stakeholders.  In order to support this process, the Commission will soon publish a study on the Law of the Sea addressing these and other relevant issues. The publication of the study will be followed by an expert meeting with Member States to identify the practical followup, having regard to the limits of the Communitys responsibility in this area as well as the oral statement.  Finally, I would like to stress once again that the Commission is very pleased with the good cooperation between the three institutions involved in reaching agreement on this extremely important piece of new Community legislation and would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their excellent contributions to achieving success on this file.
3788261 author: Philip Whittacker:  Madam President, I am pleased to open this debate on the proposal on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy, which complements the Water Framework Directive, which is the centrepiece of water protection for the European Union. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for its considerable efforts. I would also like to thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Fisheries, and in particular the draftsman and draftswomen, Mr Rbig, Mrs Bourzai and Mrs Corbey respectively, for their very constructive and supportive input on this important file.  Protecting rivers, lakes, the coastal and marine environment from pollution caused by hazardous substances is a key priority for the Commission. Since the  1970 s when the Community took its first decisive action we have made significant progress. However, as we solved some pollution problems, others emerged. The chemical cocktail in our waters has become more complex and the sources of pollution are no longer concentrated at one point but are widespread and diffuse. There has never been a time for complacency.  To tackle the pollution problems caused by these dangerous substances the Commission has proposed or adopted more than  30  Community acts since the Water Framework Directive was agreed. I cannot list them all, but let me highlight some as an example.  First, the Commission has banned or restricted the marketing and use of  16  of the priority substances of the Water Framework Directive. Further decisions on some pesticides, biocides and other existing chemicals are in the pipeline. Second, the milestone agreement on REACH, the new EU chemicals policy, will require authorisation of the most hazardous substances and reduction of risks for all other chemicals regulated under the Water Framework Directive.  In summary, I underline again that also in the future the Commission is committed to providing the necessary instruments for emissions control where they can result in the most efficient and proportionate action to resolve pollution caused by priority substances. At the same time I am committed to the principles of better regulation and to coming forward with additional proposals only where it can be demonstrated that the Community is the most appropriate level at which to act.  I shall now turn to the Commission proposal for a directive on environmental quality standards for priority substances. The objective of the proposed directive is to set harmonised and transparent criteria for assessing good chemical status of surface waters, which must be achieved by  2015 . Thus the most important part of the proposal is Annex I: the quality standards which must be respected in all rivers, lakes and coastal and territorial waters.  As you know, for marine waters the proposed Marine Strategy Directive will ensure the same level of protection regarding hazardous substances pollution in areas where the Water Framework Directive does not apply. I underline that the proposed values for quality standards already reflect the risk to the marine ecosystem that these substances may pose. In addition, the proposal identifies two additional priority hazardous substances and repeals several directives which were adopted between  1982  and  1990 .  However, the proposal does not include additional measures for emissions controls for the reasons that I outlined earlier. The Commission believes that emissions controls are adequately covered through other existing Community legislation such as the directive on integrated pollution prevention and control.  As a closing remark, I would like to emphasise that we share the objective of a high level of protection of the water environment. The Commission published its first implementation report for the Water Framework Directive on  22  March  2007 , World Water Day. It highlighted that, despite the progress, there is much work to be done, in particular by the Member States, if we want to achieve sustainable water management by making the implementation of the directive a success.  The current proposal is another step in this direction and I am committed to working with the European Parliament and the Member States to achieve the goals that we jointly set for ourselves in the year  2000 . However, there are many more steps to take and I call for your support in this process.
1428181 author: Katarina Bauer:  Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Maat, who started the work on this subject, and the rapporteur, Mr Post, for their excellent work.  As you know, on  2  June  2006 , the Commission, on behalf of the Community and Greenland, initialled a new Fisheries Partnership Agreement after three years of long and complex negotiations. The Agreement came into effect as of  1  January  2007  for a period of six years. Currently, a provisional application of the Agreement is in force through a Council decision which was adopted on  21  December  2006 .  Before making a short presentation of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Greenland, I would like to outline just a few points relating to the previous agreement, which dated back to  1985  when Greenland had left the Community. Shortly after the Fourth Protocol entered into force on  1  January  2001 , the Court of Auditors and Parliament strongly criticised the protocols under the Greenland Fisheries Agreement for including paper fish, for not including the ship owners payment and for not being transparent enough. As a consequence, the Commission emphasised the need for adjustments during the midterm review of the Fourth Protocol in order to make a clearer distinction between the value for fish and support for the development of Greenlands fisheries sector. The revision of the Fourth Protocol led to a division of funds, under which  25   of the financial contribution was earmarked for budgetary support to the fisheries sector. Paper fish were removed, real fish quotas and licence fees were introduced and provisions for an annual scientific review of the quotas were incorporated. These important changes were also incorporated into the new agreement. On this basis, during negotiations on the new agreement, the Commission has insisted on obtaining quotas for real fish and eliminating paper fish, on maintaining and even increasing the shipowners payment and on having a clear sectoral policy programme for the fisheries sector to be supported by the Community.  Another outcome of the midterm review was the Council conclusions of February  2003 , in which the Council stated that future cooperation between the Community and Greenland would be based on a twopillar approach with a broader cooperation arrangement in areas other than fisheries and a fisheries agreement. The broader agreement takes the form of a Council decision including a joint declaration and will provide up to EUR  25  million per year to Greenland on the basis of cooperation in areas other than fisheries. Therefore, one can conclude that the initialling of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement does not merely represent the closure of the negotiations conducted over the past year, but also the closure of what was initialled back in  2003  with the midterm review of the Fourth Fisheries Protocol and the Council conclusions of February  2003 .  Turning now to the new agreement, let me outline the following. The financial contribution of the previous Protocol was EUR  42 . 8  million per year, making it one of the biggest bilateral fisheries agreements. The value of the new protocol has decreased considerably given the changes to the Community quotas. Some have decreased due to the poor state of the stocks, the needs of Greenlands fishing industry and the rate of utilisation by the Community, while others have increased due to the sound state of the stocks and based on the needs of Community industry. As a result of these changes to the quotas, the Communitys financial contribution is now EUR  15 . 85  million per year. This sum includes a specific sum of EUR  3 . 26  million to be used for a multiannual fisheries policy programme in Greenland. In addition to this contribution, a payment from ship owners of EUR  2  million in the form of licences is also expected.  With regard to the amendments put forward by Parliament, I would like to stress that the Commission fully shares the concern of the Parliament on each amendment proposed. However, with respect to amendments  13 , we feel that these are already covered in the Protocol itself and we therefore consider them unnecessary. Furthermore, in relation to amendments  4  and  6  on the reporting requirements to Parliament, I would like to stress that the Commission already complies with the transmission of this information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangement. Moreover, concerning amendment  5  on the Member States compliance with reporting requirements, it should be stressed that the Commission already examines whether catch reporting is respected. In addition, it is stated in the annex and the appendix to the Protocol that vessels must comply with the reporting requirements of the previous fishing year in order to obtain a licence. On this basis, therefore, the amendment is not necessary.  Finally, on amendment  7 , I would like to make it clear that, given the previous criticism put forward by both the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament itself of the Commissions financial management of the external fisheries agreements, the Commission finds it hard to understand this amendment, which, in essence, is no different to the mechanism found under the modified Fourth Protocol and does not make it possible for the Commission to manage the underutilised fishing opportunities in the best possible way. Therefore, taking the financial responsibility of the Commission into consideration, the Commission cannot accept this amendment.  In conclusion, let me thank Parliament and, in particular, the members of the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur for their constructive engagement on this important fight.
2442883 author: Michael Brown:  rapporteur.  Mr President, before turning to the substance of this report, I should like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in the preparation of the report and in particular to thank the Commissions Trade DG and Development DG, which, I am pleased to say, have been very keen to engage with Parliament on this particular issue. Finally, I should like to thank Pelayo Castro Zuzuarregui, the Parliament official I worked with on this report. He is leaving us for a year  we hope it is only for a year!  to work for the Spanish Prime Minister. I have worked with him on this report and a number of other reports; I have found it intellectually stimulating to be in his company and I wish him well.  On the substance, Aid for Trade is a vital tool for linking developing countries to the global economy. However, I want to stress at the outset that it is not a substitute for the Doha Development Round, but a complement to it. It is clear that liberalising markets is not sufficient in itself to link developing countries into the global economy. You just have to look at the experience of the last  40  years: LDCs have seen their share of world trade almost halved from  1 . 9  to  1 , and this is despite tariff reductions following the Uruguay Round and other tariff reductions and recent efforts such as the European Everything but Arms scheme, which gives dutyfree and quotafree access to developing countries. Therefore, liberalisation, which I would argue is important, clearly of itself has not been enough to engage the developing countries fully in the global economy.  I also do not argue  and I want to make this clear  that Aid for Trade is of itself a panacea. However, it is quite clear that there is now a growing consensus on the benefits that Aid for Trade might bring. The WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December  2005  set out an ambitious work programme for Aid for Trade and called for more assistance to help developing countries into the global economy. This followed Mr Barrosos commitment at the G 8  Summit in Gleneagles of GBP  1  billion of European Union money and GBP  1  billion of Member States money to assist in the Aid for Trade budget line.  While this is all most welcome and sounded quite dramatic at the time of the announcement, we have to realise that the increases are quite modest in substance: the European Unions contribution will increase from a base of around EUR  850  million at the moment to EUR  1  billion, while the Member States  if they deliver  will go from EUR  300  million to a EUR  1  billion.  Last October the General Affairs Council called for a trade strategy to map out how we fulfil these pledges. My report indicates some of the key points I hope we will see in that strategy. Firstly, in relation to the scope of Aid for Trade, I want the measurement of the Barroso billion to be against the existing base, which has two categories: one being trade policy and regulation, the other trade development. However, I welcome the fact that the WTO task force has added three further categories: traderelated adjustment, traderelated infrastructure and productive capacity. These are vital aspects of the Aid for Trade agenda and I hope additional resources can be found to assist developing countries to deal with such matters as the phasingout of preferences, reductions in government revenue as a result of tariffs being lowered, or help in adjusting to new competitive pressures due to regionalisation, such as EPAs.  My report argues that Aid for Trade should be demandled and countryowned. In this context, the WTOs enhanced integrated framework should become the key diagnostic tool for developing countries, assisting them to identify where Aid for Trade can bring maximum benefits. Within developing countries we must also ensure that the private sector and civil society are engaged with the process. While Aid for Trade undoubtedly represents a different approach to general development aid, it should, in my opinion, be based on the same fundamental principles of poverty reduction and sustainable development, and our main point of reference should continue to be the Millennium Development Goals.  I am pleased that much of what we called for in this report was reflected in the Commissions communication published in April, and, perhaps naively, I like to believe that was part of the intense interaction between the Commissions DGs and the European Parliament. I hope that, when the final joint EU trade strategy is adopted over the summer, it will also be reflected in that strategy document.  I have called in my report today for biannual reporting back to Parliament so that we can check that the Member States and the Commission have delivered on both the quality and quantity of the aid that they are promising. All institutions so far have shown a willingness to deliver collectively on what I believe is an important strategy that can make an important, if modest, contribution to linking the poorest countries of the world into the global trading system.
1832932 author: Amy White:  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, David Martin, for what I regard as a very rich report on aid for trade. I am very glad that he has referred to the Millennium Development Goals, because they represent our guiding idea and targets. I agree with him that free trade, whilst a necessary condition for development, is not a magic wand, just as I agree with him that aid for trade, whilst a necessary component of any development strategy, is not a panacea.  I believe that this report expresses a very strong commitment to the aid for trade agenda which I fully share. I have also read the very useful suggestions and guidance regarding the content of the EU joint aid for trade strategy, for which I am very grateful. Furthermore, I welcome Parliaments engagement in this process.  Since  2005 , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have developed a clear common vision on the main principles of aid for trade. We all agree that trade can be an important catalyst for growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but the successful integration of developing countries into the world trading system requires more than better market access and strengthening of international rules. In this respect the General Affairs Council conclusions of  14  and  15  May this year recall the crucial role of aid for trade.  The challenge we are now facing is to put these principles into practice in the context of the EU aid for trade strategy on which the Commission and Member States are jointly working. This strategy should set out a roadmap to meet our financial pledges, give guidance to improve the effectiveness of our aid, provide a framework on monitoring and reporting of aid for trade, and address the capacity of the Commission and Member States to deliver aid for trade. The strategy will be ready in October of this year and will then be presented at the WTO aid for trade review, so this Parliaments report is extremely timely.  I would like to address some specific concerns raised in the report, and first of all the issue of the broadening of the scope of aid for trade in relation to the EU financial pledges. Let me emphasise that the credibility of our pledges is of great importance and make it crystal clear that there will be no changes to the scope of our pledge. The EUR  2  billion target remains related to the categories of trade policy and trade development.  I attach great importance to the wider aid for trade agenda, which includes building productive capacities beyond trade development, infrastructure and adjustment aid. For these areas, which are very capitalintensive, we need clear political commitment to do more, but let me stress once again that these efforts will not be counted in relation to our financial pledges.  Regarding the lack of additional resources for EDF funding to ACP countries, we would be happy to do more, but the Commission does not decide on the budget for the EDF. EU Member States do that. There are limited exceptions only and these are also approved by Member States and dedicated to very specific purposes such as adjustment arising from the sugar reform.  Regarding the integrated framework, I am glad to confirm what I announced in Hong Kong. The Commission is ready to commit EUR  10  million over the first two years to the multilateral part of the enhanced integrated framework. In addition to this, the Commission will complement the multilateral window with substantial bilateral and regional funding to implement activities identified through the integrated framework and prioritised by the respective partner governments. We will also provide human resources and capacity in the field to contribute to a better functioning of the integrated framework.  The issue of adjustment aid is rightly highlighted in the report. However, I do not agree that the EPA negotiations deserve a special mention in this context. Adjustment aid is relevant in relation to all external trade shocks. They may result from trade negotiations but could also be a consequence of unilateral reform as in the case of sugar. In any outcome of the EPA negotiations, the implementation of obligations of ACP partners will be phased in over a very long period and this will facilitate adjustment and identify requirements that we need to help meet.  Finally, we noted your request to look into the IMFs trade integration mechanism as part of the EU aid for trade strategy. We think that this is more appropriately addressed in cooperation with other international donors, for example as part of the global aid for trade review at WTO level.  Let me once again express my deep appreciation for this Parliaments political support for aid for trade, as well as our willingness to cooperate with the European Parliament to make further progress, and I look forward to doing so.
4231652 author: James Brown:  rapporteur.  Mr President, this is a particularly important report. The Commission, including the Commissioner himself, and I have worked very closely on it. This report highlights the complexity of establishing a forward programme for trade relations between the EU and the ACP, two very different and largely unequal groups which share a common goal to strengthen trade as a means of real development. Idealistic as this may sound, I have received a great deal of support from both the Commission and the representatives of the ACP regions and, despite the many concerns expressed by NGOs and political groups, they and I, and I am sure the Commission, remain optimistic.  EPAs have moved very slowly because of the conflicting ideas on a number of issues including regional integration, identification of sensitive products and preparing concrete and detailed proposals for EPArelated support. The ACP has been asked to do a great deal and too often the institutional infrastructure and lack of capacity has raised questions as to whether these proposals will contribute to their development in a manner that they want.  The January  2008  deadline is obviously what makes this year so crucial for EPAs. Time is running out. Negotiators must press on to reach a mutually beneficial settlement on EPAs that will help ACP countries develop and support international trade relations. In the event that some regions need more time, I believe it is incumbent on both parties to seek to ensure that ACP exports to the EU should not be harmed. This should be the objective, not discussing the feasibility of another WTO waiver, although I appreciate that the Commission is continuing to focus on reaching the deadlines. However, I am anxious to know what provisions have been outlined for these regions which find themselves without an agreement.  My report makes a number of recommendations: simplified, liberalised and more flexible rules of origin, full dutyfree, quotafree market access for the ACP, workable safeguards, dispute settlement and monitoring mechanisms with transparent provisions and a real power to act in the event of changes caused by EPAs having a harmful effect on sectors of ACP economies. These are the positive aspects and need to be correctly framed in negotiations. We need to know how these mechanisms will work and to build trust and ensure that Europe will be as keen to help implement these mechanisms as the ACP countries.  We have recognised that, if EPAs are to be successfully concluded, there must be more ACP engagement than has been demonstrated throughout these negotiations. Only a true partnership will ensure these agreements are beneficial to all parties. The official EPA review due to be completed last December failed to provide a full and comprehensive report of the status of negotiations. This is far from encouraging and I am curious as to what precedence this sets in the actual signing of the agreements.  It is clear that additional resources will be needed to cope with the effects of change ushered in by EPAs. The scalingup of trade facilitation, technical assistance and support to help ACP producers meet EU standards must be sufficiently extensive to offset losses from tariff revenues and help ACP countries take advantage of market access. In the first instance this requires greater efforts to ensure that funds already promised are spent in a timely and effective manner. The EU must be accountable for all of its development assistance and, together with the ACP, must set clear goals that boost ACP competitiveness and growth.  EPAs have an essential role to play as instruments for development and, appropriately designed, they represent an opportunity to revitalise ACPEU trading relations, promote economic diversification and regional integration, and reduce poverty in ACP countries.  I mentioned in my speech that the EU must be accountable. This is taxpayers money, and democratic accountability is of concern to all of us and is essential. We have failed in many respects to help ACP countries; now I believe we have a real chance to do something that will really make a mark, provided we have the goodwill of all of them.  Unfortunately I have to leave now to go back for personal reasons. I have worked very closely with the Commission and the Commissioner. I think we have had a very good understanding and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them. I hope that we can continue to work in that manner.
3563778 author: Victor Brown:  Mr President, I regard this report as very constructive, very realistic and very welcome.  As I said earlier this year in the Committee on International Trade, Mr Sturdys is a contribution which helps us look afresh at the challenges we face in these difficult, timepressured talks. Yes, the EPA negotiations have moved slowly  more slowly, frankly, than anyone could possibly justify. But at the same time we have to recognise that these agreements are new, innovative and ambitious. When change is involved, people inevitably are uncertain and, therefore, want to tread carefully. We need to balance our need to complete these negotiations on time with our need to respect others uncertainties.  I fully agree with the starting point of the report, that appropriately designed EPAs are an opportunity to revitalise ACPEU trading relations. In fact, I would say that they are our only real opportunity to stop the further slide of ACP trade into the commodity dependence and decreasing diversification that have typified ACP trade over the last quarter of a century. We looked for alternatives, and there is no shortage of suggestions and ideas. None provides the legally secure trade regime or links to development that EPAs do. None tackles the divisions between ACP countries in trade regimes that prevent regional markets emerging and lock countries into a NorthSouth dependency.  So I am pleased that the report recognises the good faith and ambitious approach that we have taken. At the same time it recognises that trade is not the panacea for development. Only domestically driven policy reform built on firm foundations of good governance and an enabling environment for business and investment can secure the economic growth and development which the ACP countries seek. But I also agree that trade is critical to support and build on this reform and, in so doing, deliver inclusive growth and jobs. That is why I am determined that we will take the opportunity that EPAs present to us.  The development dimension of EPAs is in using market access, not merely granting it. It is investment finance, not merely development aid. This needs new rules fit for a globalised world, and this is why I am so keen that EPAs address issues such as competition policy, public procurement and trade facilitation. But we know our partners limits and will work with them to phase in change and to identify regionally specific needs and solutions. No one is talking about immediate overnight change or imposing rules. But we will keep talking. To turn away in the face of challenge would be to neglect our duty to give the ACP the economic future they deserve. We want to secure sustainable development, not unsustainable poverty.  The Sturdy report calls for full dutyfree, quotafree market access into Europe, and this is what we propose. The Commissions market access offer was made in April and proposes full access for all products with transitions for sugar and rice to protect the managed markets that the ACP rely on. This delivers on our promises to take the greatest commitments on market access and hand the full flexibility of WTO rules on exclusions and implementation over to the ACP themselves.  Everyone will be aware of the importance the ACP rightly attach to additional development support in this negotiation. This is a point on which Robert Sturdy sets out some very useful proposals. Funding is important. We must help the ACP grasp the new trading opportunities that EPAs will provide. The EPAs will not fail for lack of financial assistance  that I can guarantee. As part of this, we have suggested that EPA regional funds be established by each of the negotiating regions in order to build a tailormade instrument, in line with international standards but owned and run by the ACP with ease of use. These funds, which would also be available to channel the support of other donors, could include institutional support to ensure that the capacity to implement the EPAs is there: private sector competitiveness  from access to finance to industrial retooling, to improving SPS standards; and helping out financially in those countries which face a fiscal challenge with the lowering of tariff barriers as revenues are shifted from governments to consumers.  So our ambition is clear: to build, through EPAs, a trade and development instrument which galvanises investment flows, internal demand, private sector activity and job creation and, in so doing, builds a sustainable fiscal base for ACP governments to operate, to provide basic services and to determine their own economic future free of WTO waivers, concessions and constraints.  Let me finish on a broader political point. There has been criticism, including from Members of this Parliament, of these negotiations, and concerns, particularly from our ACP partners, about the content, in some respects, of the negotiations. But we are now making headway in these negotiations. There is a positive dynamic to the negotiations. We have the real prospect of cementing a deep partnership for development between the EU and the ACP. The consequences of failure would be highly damaging to the EU and to the goal of balanced, dynamic growth in the ACP. That is why I welcome this report and Parliaments support in delivering these agreements. I would like to express again my appreciation for the argument and the proposals and recommendations contained in it.
6184547 author: Victor Bauer:  Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to respond to this debate on behalf of the Commission because of the importance of this subject: nothing less than future development, alleviation of poverty and opportunities to use the advantages of the international trade system are at stake for the ACP, some of the most povertystruck countries in the world to whom we owe an absolute obligation.  The Economic Partnership Agreements are about using trade as a lever for development. We have no intention of forcing ACP countries to make commitments against their will. We are operating with one constraint, however: EPAs need to be WTOcompliant, thus including tradeopening on both sides for trade in goods and trade in services. This of course, and I say this emphatically, does not mean symmetrical tradeopening between the EU and the ACP. Obviously, in marketopening towards its partners, the EU will go much beyond what ACP partners will do for the EU.  In addition, in many areas, we are ready to give serious consideration to transition periods and in some cases very long transition periods  up to  25  years  together with substantial financial aid to help these countries implement their commitments so that EPAs genuinely act as a catalyst for policy reforms in ACP countries.  Concerning market access, recently the General Affairs Council of our Member States reaffirmed the principle of dutyfree, quotafree, access to the ACP but with transition periods for a few sensitive products, notably rice and sugar. The same principle applies on bananas but we agreed on additional evaluation, notably to take into account the EUs outermost regions, and that will happen.  Specifically, in response to what Mr van den Berg said, we are jointly building with ACP regions asymmetric market access schedules which allow continued protection for ACPsensitive sectors. Our dutyfree, quotafree offer gives great scope to protect the ACP and to open their markets in a deeply asymmetric manner. In addition, flexible safeguards will be in place so that we can take action quickly if problems arise. However, a conditional market access schedule would once again put our trading arrangements in a vulnerable position in the WTO, creating further uncertainty for ACP traders and investors. Introducing such a conditional approach would therefore not be wise from the point of view of the interests of the ACP countries themselves.  Some Members have talked about alternatives to EPAs. I can say without any hesitation or qualification whatsoever: there are no better developmentfriendly or superior development instruments available to us that would exceed the ambition and the potential that Economic Partnership Agreements offer. To offer GSP as some have suggested, when instead we could negotiate good Economic Partnership Agreements, would indeed be nonsense. ACP countries that are not LDCs would end up with worse market access to the European Union than almost any other developing countries in the world.  Yes, some then go on to propose GSP as an alternative, by relaxing entry criteria to GSP and expanding its coverage. This again is completely unacceptable. GSP continues the divisions in trade regime between LDCs and nonLDCs that EPAs are seeking to remove and does not promote the use of market access in the way that EPAs do. The GSP is open to all countries and many would simply take advantage of relaxed GSP criteria, exposing the ACP to direct competition while fundamentally undermining the purpose of GSP, which is using trade preferences to promote signature of accords on human rights and good working practices. So I hope that people will not pursue or entertain the idea of GSP or GSP being an acceptable andor superior alternative to EPAs.  The best development option by far is to sign EPAs on time. Any alternative falls short of this. We cannot simply flout WTO rules on the goods trade section of EPAs. If it becomes clear that for any region we are really not going to make it, LDCs get Everything but Arms; for nonLDCs that export bananas in particular, the waiver route is probably not politically viable at all. For others, things depend on progress in negotiations.  I would like to conclude by saying that, in contrast to some of those who have spoken here in Parliament this morning, I find the approach of the ACP countries shows considerable realism and understanding of what it is in the ACPs interests to do. The ACP countries have voluntarily agreed the route map that we are following in negotiating these agreements. It is certainly not in the interests of the ACP for those who present themselves as friends of the ACP to peddle a doomsday scenario, to generate fears and insecurity which can only hold the ACP back from engaging in the negotiations which it is so much in their interest to conclude by the end of the year.
6232445 author: Mary Merx:  Madam President, unfortunately this debate today comes at a very tense moment when the situation in the whole region is deteriorating both in Lebanon and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as well as in Israel. The events of the last three days in Lebanon, with significant loss of life in such a short time  almost  100  dead  are a startling reminder of the need to work on a regional solution to this conflict. As you know, Javier Solana is in Beirut today at this very difficult moment and we hope that a better situation can be brought about.  I urge our friends in Lebanon, from all the parties and political factions, to act as they have done so far, to call for calm and to refrain from actions which could provoke a major internal conflict. Once again national unity is also at stake.  The Commission noted that all the factions, the majority and the opposition as well as Palestinian organisations, condemned Fatah alIslam and I hope that all political leaders will continue to give proof of their maturity, that ability to envisage a better future, and will prevent the conflict from again evolving into an intraLebanese fight. What is most important now is to find a solution to deescalate the situation in Tripoli and to avoid the eruption of other hot spots in the rest of the country. The population in the camps also has to be helped. Ambulances and humanitarian convoys must gain access to the camps. In the end we all know that there has to be a regional solution. In the context of this whole situation we can only call on all sides  in Lebanon and in the Palestinian Territory  to refrain from violence and prevent further escalation.  I turn now in particular to the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Like the PresidentinOffice, I too am deeply concerned about last weeks interfactional clashes in Gaza which resulted in  55  dead and  280  injured. Regrettably it seems that Gaza is at risk of sliding into civil war. Factions should stop hostilities immediately and reconcile their differences within the national unity government.  I also deplore the resumption of the Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza on the Israeli city of Sderot, which yesterday caused the death of an Israeli woman. Israeliled air strikes in retaliation then caused the death of  35  Palestinians, so this vicious cycle has started again. Therefore it is important that the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians be restored and extended to the West Bank.  During my recent meeting with the Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister, Ziad Abu Amr, we discussed the fragile situation of the national unity government, especially as concerns security, but also the budget. The first decisions taken by the government seem to point in the right direction. Mr Abu Amr mentioned that his government considers itself the cabinet of President Abbas. This government has a different programme from its predecessor and I felt encouraged after this meeting. I think that it deserves our clear support. President Abbas has requested all our backing, as his political survival may depend on its success. I hope that this very difficult violent situation can be contained.  In the meantime, Finance Minister Salam Fayad, whom I met after the formation of the government, faces the incredible challenge of repairing the Palestinian public finances after one year of institutional decay and a sharp decrease in revenues. Against all odds he has made considerable progress and the technical conditions for receiving direct funding have almost been put in place.  As you know, the Palestinian Authority has three main sources of funding: internal taxes, taxes and customs revenues on imported products, and foreign aid. Internal taxes have dwindled as a result of the economic slowdown. Since last years election, Israel has also withheld the taxes and customs revenues on imported products. This is the major cause of the Palestinian Authoritys financial difficulties. Furthermore, foreign aid cannot flow easily as a result of the USimposed restrictions on financial transactions with the Palestinian Authority Government  We are helping to solve these financial problems in three ways. First, our Temporary International Mechanism has become a core source for funding for allowances, fuel costs and core supplies. Since the formation of the national unity government we manage this TIM in close cooperation with Salam Fayads Ministry of Finance.  Since the establishment of the TIM last June, we have already transferred over EUR  300  million through this mechanism. I would like to thank Parliament for its support in making more budgetary resources available so that the TIM can continue to deliver.  A second way in which we are helping is to work with our US partners to facilitate the transfer of foreign aid to the Palestinians, in particular the Arab funds pledged in Riyadh at the recent Arab summit.  Last but not least, we have urged Israel on multiple occasions to resume the transfer of Palestinian tax and customs revenues. We are using all the instruments we have, whether economic or political, but the survival of this government does not depend only on us. Only the resumption of all financial flows to the Palestinian Authority can deliver a durable solution to their financial crisis. And the Palestinians have to play their role and decide once and for all to end their fighting and focus on peace.  We still think that, despite the distress we are witnessing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Lebanon, we should profit from an important window of opportunity in the peace process in case it shuts down again, so it is very important that the German initiative is successful. It is crucial that the Arab League relaunches its Peace Initiative. As you know, there has been a determined diplomatic followup at the highest level in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. I myself have had several meetings with the FollowUp Committee in Sharm el Sheikh, in Riyadh, and also more recently at the GAERC meeting in Brussels.  SecretaryGeneral Amr Moussa and others have underlined the urgency which is more evident than ever today and he has asked for our help in bringing the parties to the table. On the Israeli side, I am encouraged that Foreign Minister Livni has been to Cairo and is now expecting a followup visit by her Jordanian and Egyptian counterparts in the coming weeks. She has also shown willingness to engage more than in the past and she will also be invited by the German Presidency to the next GAERC meeting.  At the same time I also endorse the efforts of Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice to bring the parties together and start discussing the political horizon for the Palestinians. I hope that will be possible even though events are not going well at this moment. The energy and efforts invested by Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others must also be recognised.  Next week the Quartet will meet. I hope that this meeting will respond to the efforts of the Arab League, which could relaunch the progress on all tracks of the peace process, but I am also realistic and I understand what the German Presidency has said, that we should at least uphold the situation.
6227682 author: Frederic White:  Mr President, it has been a very passionate discussion and I completely understand why because, as I said before, we all feel a great frustration. But you have to understand that, over the last  10  years, the European Union has really tried to play an important role for the peace process  not in order to enhance the conflict but in order to make peace, or help to make peace. In the end it is always the two parties that have to be ready, but we try to push them. We were then quite happy to be an important and influential member of the Quartet.  However, we can only be a facilitator of this peace. That means we have to look to both sides. We cannot just go to one side, and therefore we feel that we embraced the three Quartet principles as important basic principles. It really is the Council, not the Commission, that can recognise the Government  there are  27  Member States. I understand if you ask me to do so, but it is not me who can take this decision.  I know there is one instrument which you have indirectly mentioned: the cancellation or suspension of the association agreement with Israel; but do you really think this would make a difference? I do not think it would. We would no longer be a facilitator of this process, so it would be the wrong instrument at this moment.  What we have as an instrument is a continuous political dialogue where all the parties work with all the parties, but it is true that there are other members of the Quartet too, for instance the United States of America, as has been mentioned. It is very important that we feel that there is also a push from that side too. Over the last months, we have seen a much greater effort on the part of the USA, particularly from Condoleezza Rice. We have all welcomed that and have tried to move forward. The German Presidency, in particular Mrs Merkel, but also Foreign Minister Steinmeier, have really tried to move forward.  A political solution can never be brought about by violence. Unfortunately, we now have violence again. I can promise  and this is within the Commissions competence  that we will further engage with the National Unity Government, as we have started to do. But as we have said our policy is a gradual engagement and we cannot do everything. Even Salam Fayad said to me when I first met him after the formation of the Government that I would need some time to clean up the mess in the Finance Ministry  and this is still not completely done. Therefore, we are nearly there, the technical conditions would be ready, but you also know that the Council has to give us some political backing. I want you to understand these things.  I think the situation is very dramatic, and I hope that the Council understands that we have to engage in order to help this National Unity Government achieve the right platform to continue with the peace process and with the talks on the political horizon. We know that it is a complicated situation, and that is why I said that I see at least some positive hope in the fact that Foreign Minister Livni will attend the next Council meeting after the very positive meeting we had with the Arab League, but on the ground I agree that the situation is very difficult, and, besides all this, it is also those factions and those different radical groups that are outside the Government that would like to jeopardise the whole process. It is a vicious circle and I agree that we have to try to break it up.  An honourable Member mentioned that we have extended our mission monitoring the Rafah border crossing. We did that because we think that opening up freedom of movement of goods and people is so important. I myself have been working on that with Prime Minister Olmert. I remember my last visit there when I took it up in order really to go into the details. But there are security concerns. Unfortunately, there are suicide bombers coming over the borders, a lot of funds are being smuggled, so you always have the two sides of this conflict, but we think that it is important to have prolonged this mission at the Rafah crossing because only with the European Union is there a chance of there being an opening.  We are engaging. We are also working with the Finance Minister, not only on the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM), but also on institution building and technical assistance, helping them particularly on the question of customs, revenue collection and on auditing. This has been asked for by Salam Fayad, so we are working with them. I said we will also look at what we can then perhaps fund through the TIM as regards their particular desires, so not only those things that we have been funding up till now in order to help the population to survive, but to go further.  This is what I can offer you in this delicate and difficult situation. We have to go on pushing and bringing the different parties together. I hope that the time window is still open.
735596 author: Michael McNabb:  These are issues that we have discussed previously: how to supply the European Union with sufficient energy resources. As you know today  50  of our energy supplies are covered by imports and we know that in the future the percentage will be even higher. It could be  65 , with more than  80  of gas being imported and even more oil, with over  90  being imported.  For this reason we will continue to work with all traditional suppliers. For gas it is Russia which today provides  27 . 5  of our supplies. Oil is supplied by Norway at  14  and Algeria at  12 . 5 . For this reason, we are interested in strengthening ties with traditional suppliers and obtaining more supply routes. Supply routes that deliver gas and oil are exposed to danger. I would mention a recent explosion in the Ukrainian gas pipeline system. That certainly had an impact on transport but, because there were other ways of delivering gas, it did not affect the EU internal market. However, it is very clear that having more supply routes is more beneficial for consumers.  EU dependency on Russia should not be overemphasised because it is clear that, with Russia having the biggest gas resources as well as being one of the countries with the biggest oil resources, it is natural that supplies from Russia are topping our import list. The BurgasAlexandroupolis oil pipeline is in my opinion a very important project because it bypasses the Turkish Straits. In this way, it reduces first of all the possibility of an environmental disaster and secondly it is an additional supply route to channel oil that is produced north of the Caspian to European markets. So, for this reason, this project also got support from the Commission because it is an additional supply route and it does not increase our dependence on Russia.  At the same time it is very important to diversify; first because relying on one supplier gives the monopoly supplier a chance to dictate the price but also because it gives an opportunity to influence consumer choices. For this reason the European Union has actively diversified its supply. One of the areas where we have been getting supplies this year is the Caspian Sea and ShahDeniz in Azerbaijan, where we have established very good cooperation from the countries surrounding Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.  Nabucco will be the next project that will be implemented. Nabucco is a more ambitious project. It will take a bit more time but we are well on track to obtaining supplies from this source through the fourth potential gas supply corridor. At the same time we are also diversifying oil supplies because a project has also been announced from Samsun to Ceyhan, an additional oil supply project that again will bring oil from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea region towards the European Union.  We are encouraging cooperation with these countries around the world because, even if there are three big suppliers to the gas market  Russia, Iran and Qatar  there are other suppliers who could increase supplies. Norway will increase supplies to the European Union in the next few years by close to  50 . The same is happening with Algeria, which will provide additional supplies and more and more LNG terminals are coming onstream.  For this reason, I believe that we should continue to work with Russia. We should continue to buy energy resources because, for Russia, the EU is the best possible market because it is the closest market and mutual ties have existed for some time, but for security of supply it is important to diversify.  Additionally, I would like to stress two further elements because it is never the case that you can rely only on imports. It is important to develop energy sources inside the European Union, to be extremely energyefficient and to build internal energy infrastructure whether it be pipelines or electricity transmission lines. The European Union is very active in all these areas, even if we always recognise that each country decides on its own energy mix. But, through the instruments of the internal market and through the instruments given us by European legislation, we are encouraging the use of local resources and being very energyefficient.
3947651 author: Nancy Jones:  Member of the Commission. Madam President, as we have just heard, Nigeria has recently held important elections that will determine the transfer of power from one civilian president to another. On the invitation of the Nigerian authorities, the Commission fielded a large independent election observation mission (EOM), which performed well and cooperated closely with other international and domestic observer groups. I appointed Mr van den Berg  who had also observed the elections in  2003   chief observer for those elections, and he will shortly give us his report.  The mission concluded that the  2007  state and federal elections fell short of basic international and regional standards for democratic elections, pointing out that they were marred by poor organisation  as has already been cited, a lack of essential transparency and safeguards, widespread irregularities, significant evidence of fraud and disenfranchisement of voters. Sadly, at least  200  deaths from electionrelated violence were also reported. Other international observers  including those fielded by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the US National Democratic Institute, led by Madeleine Albright  were also very critical, as were domestic observation groups.  The EU Presidency expressed disappointment at these elections not having marked progress in relation to  2003 , which has now been reiterated by our president, at the irregularities and at the high toll of victims. The reactions and the messages from the international community had been consistent in urging Nigerians who have complaints about the process to use the legal provisions outlined in the Constitution and in the Electoral Act, commending the independence shown by the judiciary and the engagement of civil society and praising the commitment of poll workers and voters.  Disappointment at this missed opportunity is widespread in the international community, as Nigeria  one of the major powers in Africa  could have set an example of successful consolidation of the democratic process, which would have had a tremendous positive impact on the African continent. This is even more regrettable as the elections were held in an improved atmosphere in which the freedoms of assembly and expression were at least broadly respected.  The elections have highlighted the many problems and shortcomings of the Nigerian democratic process, and the Commission is aware that many challenges and misgivings need now to be addressed and overcome. In the short term, pressure should be placed on Nigerias Independent National Electoral Commission to publish a complete breakdown of the polling station results, which is a basic requirement of transparency, and the judiciary should also be encouraged to act swiftly and responsibly with the election petitions. If redress is not provided, this could have serious implications for the future.  While the lessons learned will have to be taken into account in our future relations with Nigeria, entrenching positions should be avoided. I think the political dialogue has to restart, but future relations will have to include a deeper engagement at federal, state and Community level with a wider range of players in civil society and government. The topic of the elections must be a key feature of the political dialogue with Nigeria, based on the recommendations of the EOM. Our readiness to engage Nigeria in a political dialogue and the commitment to promote the strengthening of governments and democracy in the country, particularly together with ECOWAS, is highlighted in the joint EUECOWAS communiqu issued on  24  April at the  11 th EUECOWAS ministerial meeting.  While the main instrument for political dialogue will remain Articles  8  and  9  of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, the programming of the development cooperation to be financed by the  10 th European Development Fund will also provide a crucial avenue for dialogue and the opportunity to take into account lessons learnt from the elections and the outcome of the discussions with the new Government, civil society and other key players.
8711478 author: Christoph Merx:  Member of the Commission. Madam President, we all agree that, unfortunately, these elections were a real disappointment, but I hope that democracy in Nigeria will become a force in the future, and not a farce. We have a lot of work to do. I agree that it is not possible or advisable to continue with business as usual, and certainly we will not do that.  As has been said by, I believe, a majority here, we have to engage with members of civil society in Nigeria who are willing to change the situation and the election process. This must be part of the dialogue that we have to follow up, based especially on the recommendations of the EOM.  On the other hand, political engagement and dialogue with the Government are also needed. Such a dialogue has to be regular; it has to be structured; it has to be held at troika, or local or even higher level, and must be extended to national and regional organisations, as was done between the EU and ECOWAS, as was just mentioned, as well as to representatives of civil society.  As regards the Electoral Commission, according to the observers, there were irregularities and fraud, but INEC in particular failed to act independently as it is required to do. It is clear, therefore, that INEC, tarnished as it is by serious doubts over its impartiality, cannot continue to be a beneficiary of EDF support. Issues concerning INECs independence, mandate, structure and leadership must therefore be addressed before any decision about the continuation of our support can be taken.  As regards the Niger Delta, which has already been mentioned by some of you, the Human Rights Watch report entitled Chop Fine on Rivers State is emblematic of a situation widespread in the Niger Delta, where large financial resources are made available, but very little reaches the people and even less the communities in remote areas of the Delta. People there have been deprived of their voices and land resources, and they are not given anything in return by the Government.  The threats and challenges presented by this area are left unaddressed and will, sooner or later, have serious repercussions at national and regional level. The ambassadors of the EU Member States have twice submitted clear and simple recommendations. Before the financial resources allocated to the Niger Delta are increased, total transparency should be ensured and dialogue between all the stakeholders established.  Articles  8  and  9  of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement have also been mentioned. They contain all the ingredients needed to ensure the most effective dialogue not only with the Government but also with civil society and the regional African organisations, as has been said. I consider it absolutely paramount that more coherent, more regular and more systematic action by the EU as a group visvis Nigeria is the only possible way of addressing the questions highlighted by these elections. This should be a very strong thrust of our policy.  On the other hand, we have to be careful not to push Nigeria into the hands of religious extremists, including Muslim extremists.  China has been mentioned. When I was in China in January, I made it clear that we want to have a dialogue on Africa with China. It is not so easy to do, but it is very important and, therefore, it is important that Nigeria is being invited to the G 8  Summit in order to give them these messages directly, because we have to tell Nigeria that we want our values and interests to be respected and it cannot only be a question of pure economic matters.  I shall just repeat that the EIDHR provides an opportunity to work with civil society. It can work without the approval of the Government, but we normally have contact with the Government.  Finally, it is also important to see what our financial funding means there. It is a mere  0 . 2  of the oil revenue and the total international aid to Nigeria. Therefore this makes the consequences of aid suspension negligible from a financial viewpoint and potentially counterproductive, as it would further impair political dialogue with the Government. But, on the whole,  25  of funding is promoting good governance. Therefore, we should use this part in particular in order to work with civil society, as I think we would all agree.
4002527 author: Sarah MacLeod:  rapporteur.  Madam President, I am honoured to present the Committee on Foreign Affairs report entitled Kashmir: present situation and future prospects.  This report correctly contrasts the situation between the worlds largest secular democracy which has devolved structures at all levels  India, including Jammu and Kashmir  and Pakistan, which still lacks full implementation of democracy in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and has yet to take steps towards democracy in Gilgit and Baltistan. It also highlights the fact that there is considerable evidence that over many years Pakistan has provided Kashmiri militants with training, weapons, funding and sanctuary and has encouraged militants to commit atrocities on the Indianadministered side. It takes a firm line on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir.  It is also constructive as it highlights the common heritage shared by India and Pakistan, exemplified in the ancient culture of Jammu and Kashmir, and recognises and values the pluralism, multiculturalism and multifaith nature and secular traditions of the peoples of Jammu and Kashmir, which have been kept alive in the Indian part of Jammu and Kashmir.  This is an enlightened and balanced report, which denounces terrorism and those who support terrorism; it promotes a vision of peace, coexistence, friendship and economic integration and commerce between peoples on both sides of the border and in Gilgit and Baltistan along the lines of the European Union model.  I urge this House to adopt it in its entirety, with certain amendments, so that an unambiguous message is sent to the disturbers of peace in that part of the world that the international community will not tolerate extremism or terrorism any more and that we respect and uphold the rights and ethnicity of the Kashmiri people.  I have with me a strong statement  of this morning  by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Chairperson of the Pakistan Peoples Party, in which she welcomes this report for drawing attention to the right of selfdetermination of the Kashmiri people; for reaffirming the EUs commitment to the settlement of dispute by peaceful means; for taking note of the impact of the earthquake and urging the European Union to help and support the Kashmiris; for supporting the role of the composite peace process in moving towards a durable settlement for the Kashmiris based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights; for urging the Indian and Pakistan Governments to facilitate the ceasefire on the Line of Control by calling further on militant armed groups to enrol in a disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation process; for encouraging the Pakistan Government to transform the ceasefire in place in Siachin since  2003  into a lasting peace agreement; for urging both governments to allow international human rights organisations immediate and unrestricted access to all parts of the former princely state in order to investigate the human rights situation there; for calling on the Indian Government to put an end to all practices of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detentions in Jammu and Kashmir; for calling on the Indian and Pakistani authorities to ease restrictions on travel between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad; for urging Pakistan to revisit its concepts of fundamental rights of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religious practices in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan; for calling for the firstever elections to be held in Gilgit and Baltistan and for seeking higher democratic representation in the Northern Areas. She firmly supports this report.  I am proud to inform the House that Imran Khan MP, former captain of the Pakistan cricket team and now head of his political party TehreekeInsaaf, today pledged his full support for this report.  The plight of the Kashmiri people has been of concern to the international community for nearly  60  years. The European Union strongly supports regional integration, trade liberalisation and economic cooperation. The European Parliament is keenly interested in all aspects of the situation.  Let me draw your attention to the hundreds of young people who demonstrated in favour of this report, calling for the democratic freedoms that we recommend. They were beaten up by the police, their banners and petitions to the UN were destroyed. They demonstrated again. Two hundred of their relatives were kidnapped and have not been heard of since. Subsequently, many thousands of citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir have held meetings and pledged their full support for the report.  Over the border in Jammu and Kashmir, India continues to be criticised for her large military presence. The report is strong on human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, as in the other areas.  In Gilgit and Baltistan, the people are kept in poverty, illiteracy and backwardness.  The report makes clear its support for the current peace process. It recognises the ancient and unique heritage of the Kashmiri people. It reflects many principles of the European Union. I earnestly hope that this House will support the report as wholeheartedly during the vote today as it was supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
362292 author: Jennifer Bush:  Mr President, as we all know and as Mr Solana has just said, the atmosphere in the region is extremely tense. I would even say that there is even a sense of despair. My director is still there and he has just called me. Unfortunately, security has deteriorated and we are witnessing a vicious circle of violence, particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in Israel and in Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said.  If the causes of this despair are not addressed, we may very soon witness the consolidation of more radical groups throughout the region. I think this is the great danger there. In Lebanon, as Mr Solana has just said, fighting has now spread to other Palestinian camps. We are therefore deeply concerned that the confrontation between the Lebanese armed forces and the Islamist insurgents is there. This has turned out to be the most serious internal conflict since the end of the civil war and has already cost over  100  human lives.  I would like to stress once again our full support for the legitimate government of Lebanon. I would, however, repeat our position that everything possible has to be done to avoid further casualties among the civilian population. The relief agencies must be able to carry out their work.  On the other hand, I would also like to express my satisfaction with the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution  1757 , which secures the establishment of a special tribunal on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. I think this will allow the people of Lebanon to affirm respect for the law and the rule of law in their country and to turn a page on one of the most tragic events in Lebanons recent history.  The meeting due to take place in Gaza tomorrow between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert has unfortunately been cancelled, but at least the leaders of the G 8  will tomorrow be tackling the issue of the PalestineIsraeli conflict, as we did at the G 8  Foreign Ministers meeting. There was the greatest concern about the political and security developments both in Gaza and in Israel, but also recognition that there is no alternative to continuing this humanitarian support and, on the other hand, to exploring how to support this Arab peace initiative.  Even at this very delicate and difficult time, we believe that there is still some reason for hope, because the Israeli initiative is a unique opportunity for a comprehensive solution. We know that the Egyptians too are trying to broker a ceasefire with all the Palestinian factions. US involvement, particularly the involvement of Condoleezza Rice, is very valuable at this difficult time. Our EU Presidency is also very committed. The Quartet has done exactly as Mr Solana has said, I think it was a very good meeting and the idea is there for both the bilateral track and the regional track. Hopefully the meeting can come about in Egypt with Arab League interlocutors and hopefully also with the two parties.  Two days ago I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Mr Abdel Ilah AlKhatib, who is planning, with his Egyptian counterpart, to visit Israel before the Arab League meets with the Quartet at the end of June. We hope that this will help to further engage Israel and encourage it to respond positively to the Arab peace initiative.  Last week I also attended a conference in Vienna on the role of women leaders as contributors to peace and security in the Middle East. Prominent women, such as Tzipi Livni, Hanan Ashrawi, Condoleezza Rice and others, discussed the potential contribution of civil society, of women in society, to peace. Even if it is a small contribution, this was the first time that Tzipi Livni and Hanan Ashrawi had held discussions at the same table. I must say that there was quite a lot of mutual understanding and there was even a friendly atmosphere. The initiative proved to be another useful part of this very difficult process. I plan to organise some sort of followup meeting in Brussels, perhaps next year.  We very much appreciate the European Parliaments involvement: the visit by the EP Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council was followed by your visit, Mr President, and by your very balanced speech in the Knesset on  30  May. It is encouraging that the speech, as you said, was quite well received by the Knesset. This is not an easy opportunity.  The Palestinian people desperately need a political perspective. We, the members of the Quartet, are all clear on that. This is why we must press for negotiations on a final status issue, cooperating with the structures set up by the Arab League. The Arab League asked Israel to free certain measures also related to the occupation, for instance the settlements and the separation barrier. I was very encouraged by President Abbass call for an immediate end to this internal violence, because Qassam rockets from Gaza have to stop once and for all. The ceasefire should indeed be extended to the West Bank. I very much regret that tomorrows meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas had to be cancelled, but we apparently have to realise that the two sides could not reach agreement on Abbass plan for a ceasefire, in particular on linking the ceasefire in Gaza with the cessation of military operations in the West Bank. No agreement was possible, either, on unfreezing Palestinian clearance revenues withheld by Israel before the release of the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit. We had hoped for some movement on this. The Palestinians decided that they could not risk this meeting, but of course we had all hoped that this would give a little more progress on the dialogue on the ceasefire, progress on the transfer of revenues and on movement of access.  Regarding the National Unity Government, in my opinion now is certainly not the time to give up on it. I can agree that it has not yet delivered everything we were hoping for, but there are no attractive alternatives. If we allow this Government to crumble, the implications for the institutions of the Palestinian Authority are very grave and radical splinter groups may be strengthened as a result. I think this is the last result we would want.  As you know, within the limits set by the Council of Ministers, the Commission has responded quickly to the National Unity Government and to the increased needs of the Palestinians. In the first half of  2007  alone, we committed EUR  320  million of Community funds, which almost equals the total amount of funds committed last year. This exceptional effort shows that, since the formation of the National Unity Government, we have stepped up our emergency assistance to the Palestinians. But the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority is extremely grave, as Salam Fayyad told my colleague yesterday. They still need us to go on even with this mechanism. Israel must release the withheld clearance revenue to the Palestinian Authority. I think we therefore will have to go on encouraging them to do so via the temporary international mechanism or through the PLO account. We reiterated this request at the last Association Committee with Israel in Jerusalem on  4  June. The Quartet has also noted the importance of the resumption of transfers to improve economic and humanitarian conditions in the West Bank and Gaza. As I said, movement is of course essential in any case.  Since the formation of this National Unity Government, we have been working very closely with the Minister of Finance. Because the socioeconomic situation is so dire, we will extend the TIM until  30  September and we must look for fresh funds for this new extension. I will soon ask the European Parliament and the Council to make another effort and to find additional resources in the budget. I thank you for whatever you have given as support in the past and do hope that this support will also be extended to us in the future, because our priority task should be to help restore the institutions of the Palestinian authority so that it can then deliver services to the Palestinian people. We are trying gradually to shift towards a resumption of institutionbuilding and development projects, and to decrease our current concentration on emergency and humanitarian aid if we can do so  of course, this condition is still there.  We look forward to new Palestinian proposals. They said they would come up with ideas for specific international support. The Palestinian Authority is currently preparing an operational plan which could then be a useful tool for identifying development activities, particularly in Gaza, that we could support.  I would also like to say that the financial deficit of the Palestinian Authority is so large that it would be impossible for the Community to shoulder the burden alone. Arab States also have to deliver on their commitments to help the National Unity Government. I was encouraged to see that the PLO account established now was at least used by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. This will help but it is not sufficient.  (Applause)
4051029 author: Michael Reid:  Mr President, I should very briefly like to reply to the contributions from the honourable Members representing the different political groups in this House.  I think that most of the speeches followed a line which is in a sense the same one that we have been defending for a long time: namely, the time has come to move on from the policy of crisis management  which is very important, but it is not enough. We need policies, together with crisis management, to solving the conflict. We need to work towards a political horizon to really begin to get into the business of solving the conflict that started  40  years ago. That is basically the view everybody has expressed, and it is something that we will be trying to do in the coming days.  I told you that last Wednesday the Quartet met in Berlin, and I said that for the first time the Quartet is committed to starting a debate with the parties in order to begin to work towards a political horizon. This means that, before the end of this month, the Quartet will meet with the Palestinians and Israelis in order to push forward the dialogue  which is still in its preliminary stages  that has begun between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert. They are the two people who must find the way towards peace. It is our obligation to push and to provide a catalyst for this process. That is what we are going to do. It is written very clearly in the statement produced by the Quartet last Wednesday. I think that this is a profound change, and I would like to underline that, because someone asked whether we are going wait passively for a catastrophe to arrive. The answer is no: we do not want to do that; you do not want to do that; the people in the region do not want to do that. Therefore, under the leadership of the Quartet, we are trying to put forward this mechanism in order to move towards peace.  A few other ideas were put forward by some of the honourable Members representing the political groups, including the suggestion of an international force. I would like to say that, for the first time in many years, the idea of an international force is not out of the question. As you know, the idea was brought up in the Knesset by two members of the parliamentary groups, saying that this may be the time to call for an international force, at least at the beginning, in a peacekeeping role or to control the border in the south  the socalled Philadelphi Corridor  where the Rafah Crossing is situated. We are working on that, as you probably know, because information has already been published. The Israelis are also considering that possibility, as are the Palestinians. The Egyptians are also considering that possibility with different intensity. For the Egyptians it would probably be very difficult to have an international force there, as it may give the impression that they are not able to control that part of the border. However, I think that we can still begin discussions on these issues and perhaps eventually reach a solution.  This also ties in with what Mrs Napoletano said about the success of UNIFIL. The fact that the international force has been responsible for UNIFIL  i.e. for the application of the UN Security Council resolution on Lebanon  and the manner in which it has been perceived  i.e. the efficiency of the force, of which the backbone is European  have also caused some in the Israeli Government, the Knesset and Israel as a whole to think that it might be possible for a force of that nature also to be applied elsewhere.  In a way, we have to link all the issues together. It may be possible for us to use what we have learned from our presence in Lebanon in another place. That opens the way to a monitoring presence which will be absolutely necessary if we want the peace process to come to fruition.  I would like to stress again that, as regards Lebanon, the resolution creating the tribunal is very important. The tribunal is not against anybody. There has been a very negative reaction in Syria, but I must stress that an international tribunal is not against anybody, any country. It is a tribunal that is organised in order to see who is responsible for the killing of a good man  a friend of many of ours, Mr Hariri  who was assassinated in a manner that has to be clarified if we want peace and reconciliation in Lebanon. Therefore we in the European Union have been working towards this, and last Wednesday the Security Council came to another important decision on setting up an international tribunal.  I would like to say once again that what we have striven to do in taking the Quartet in the direction that we are now moving is something that has many fathers  or many mothers  as always, but you can be sure that the Europeans have been working very hard from the very beginning to arrive at this moment. Let us hope that we are able to continue working in that direction. It will be difficult, but for the future I hope to have the support, help and understanding of the European Parliament, as always.  (Applause)
8706557 author: Katarina LaCourt:  Mr President, I am pleased to open this debate on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury. I should like to thank the draftsman and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts so far. I should also like to thank the Committee on International Trade and its rapporteur, Mr Holm, for their contribution to this file.  Mercury is internationally recognised as highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife. Initially seen as an acute local problem, mercury pollution is now also understood to be global, diffuse and chronic. High doses can be fatal to humans and even relatively low doses can have serious adverse neurodevelopmental impacts.  Against this background, the Commission developed a comprehensive Community strategy concerning mercury, which was adopted in January  2005 . Its key aim is to reduce mercury levels in the environment and human exposure through a number of actions that address all aspects of the mercury lifecycle. The European Parliament welcomed the strategy and its overall approach in the resolution adopted in March  2006 .  The proposal that is now before you implements two key actions identified in the strategy, namely Action  5  (by banning the export of metallic mercury from the Community) and Action  9  (by requiring the safe storage of mercury that is no longer needed in the chloralkali industry).  The primary production of mercury came to an end within the Community four years ago when the last active mine in Almadn in Spain stopped its activities. The environmentally desirable phasingout of mercurycell technology into chloralkali industry results, however, in a new source of mercury supplies: some  12   000  tonnes of surplus mercury will come out of the sector over the next number of years until its transition to mercuryfree technologies is completed.  Most mercury is currently exported from the Community, and exports of up to  800  tonnes per year end up, at least partly, in unregulated and uncontrolled uses like artisanal gold mining. This is how EU mercury is adding to global mercury exposure.  The basic aim of the proposed regulation is to stop these exports and to ensure that mercury no longer used in the chloralkali industry is safely stored and cannot reenter the environment.  On the basis of the impact assessment, the Commission also proposes to apply the safe storage requirement to two other industrial sources of mercury  natural gas cleaning and mercury resulting as a byproduct of nonferrous metal mining.  The storage obligation is a logical development from the export ban, as the small remaining internal market for mercury will be unable to absorb the quantities at stake. Recycling and recovery will ensure that mercury is still available for remaining legitimate uses. Storage operations will fall under the legal framework of the Waste Landfill Directive, with additional safety requirements reflecting the specific properties of metallic mercury.  The Commission aimed at proposing a straightforward, simple legislative proposal that is backed by a sound knowledge base and avoids, in line with the principles of better regulation, any excessive administrative burden for industry or for public administration.  The proposal refrains from taking legislative action in fields where the impact assessment did not provide any solid justification for such action or any clear view on its possible impact.  I should also like to underline that the industry concerned, namely the chloralkali sector, signalled its support for this proposal and is willing to sign up to a voluntary commitment. This commitment engages industry to select highly qualified storage operators and ensures that key data on mercury flows will be made available.  The Commission intends to acknowledge this commitment, in line with the principles and procedures set out in the communication on the environmental agreements adopted in  2002 .  It is not the purpose of the proposal to implement the whole of the mercury strategy: its scope is deliberately more concise. Work on other actions of the strategy is ongoing.
5653293 author: Helen Cameron:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou for her excellent report. It comes at a key moment as it concerns cooperation with the southern Mediterranean area, whilst the strengthened Neighbourhood Policy is also being implemented. I shall speak first about the main findings before turning to the current situation in the Palestinian Territories and our response to that.  Firstly, with regard to the performance of MEDA over the last  10  years, I am pleased about Parliaments positive appreciation of how this programme has contributed to realising the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration. Further progress can and should still be achieved, but I share Parliaments view that the Barcelona Process remains the most appropriate framework for the Mediterranean policy. This process is now supported by the Neighbourhood Policy which will help to develop bilateral relations and put into practice many of the aspirations of the Barcelona agenda.  In terms of effectiveness and thoroughness, the findings of Parliament and those of the Court of Auditors encourage the Commission to continue further improving its performance. It is clear that we will also take into account the different suggestions from the two institutions. I undertake to continue the efforts of the Commission in this regard, and we have already launched a final evaluation of the MEDA Regulation. The results should be available in early  2008 .  All our efforts need to be seen in the context of the ongoing and progressive management improvements which have been introduced by the Commission since  2001 . I entirely share Parliaments view on the issues of fostering greater social cohesion and sustainable economic development. Equally, I share your willingness to pursue the objectives of the Barcelona Process as identified in the report. We have taken numerous initiatives in this regard through thematic support, for instance in the areas of good governance, democracy and gender. Lastly, as regards visibility, I have made a great personal priority of visibility, on which we are making progress.  Your report, Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou, clearly analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the MEDA programme. It acknowledges the improvements that have been achieved, but also points out where it is still necessary to make further progress. The new ENPI regulation, in force since the beginning of this year, offers enormous new opportunities. Therefore, we are looking forward to continued dialogue and your constructive support.  Turning to the current situation in the Palestinian Territories, we are more than ever at a critical juncture. We are following the situation day to day, even hour to hour, and for the moment we are addressing the urgent needs and will probably have to continue doing so. As our Council President said at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday, we had a long and intensive discussion on the Middle East. There was broad agreement on the need to support President Abbas and his new government led by Prime Minister Fayyad. This has also been the line taken by the Quartet.  It has already been said that the EU will resume normal relations with this government immediately. At the same time, we cannot abandon the humanitarian needs of the population in Gaza, and we will never let the Palestinian population down.  With regard to assistance, there was a strong wish to develop the conditions for urgent, practical and financial support. That includes: extending the emergency relief under the Temporary International Mechanism for another three months, this time with the complete cooperation of Salam Fayyad; continuing humanitarian assistance, including to Gaza; exploring options to relaunch direct financial support, including the building of institutions; supporting the Palestinian civilian police through the resumption of the EUPOL COPPS; and hopefully resuming the EU Border Assistance Mission, EU BAM Rafah.  I made it clear to the Council and to Prime Minister Fayyad that resuming direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority implies certain technical conditions  that means controlling conditions  in terms of audit control and verification. I can tell you that we are already in touch with Prime Minister Fayyad and his staff on how this can be achieved. Indeed, a meeting took place yesterday with my head of delegation and the Prime Minister.  As a first step, we intend to pay EUR  22  million directly from a reserve to help towards clearing the arrears of the Palestinian Authority, particularly to the private sector so that it sees there is some movement.  The TIM will also continue for the moment to channel funds vital for the Palestinians in both an accountable and transparent way. It will operate, as I say, in support of the Fayyad Government as of now. In this regard, let me thank you and welcome the political agreement on the extra EUR  90  million for the TIM. I also hope that the procedures for adoption can be accelerated.  As the PresidentinOffice of the Council has already said, the most important thing is that the withheld Palestinian funds, for which we have called so often on the Israelis to release, will hopefully finally be sent to the government of Mahmoud Abbas.  Finally, let me take this occasion to thank Parliament once again for its support, which has been, and will continue to be, essential. Under the TIM, a European initiative, we have provided high levels of support reaching more than one million Palestinians  medicines, hospital supplies, fuel for essential public services, allowances both for the poor and the public sector. That would not have been possible without your support, and now for the future we also need your support for all the items I have just mentioned.
1720660 author: Annette MacLeod:  VicePresident of the Commission. Mr President, I should especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, for the report, which contains a series of very useful recommendations.  Many of these recommendations address the level of ambition that a truly comprehensive common European asylum system should have. Many of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in this report are addressed in our Green Paper on the future of asylum policy, which I proposed on  6  June and which the Commission has adopted, and on which I intend to launch a broad European debate.  The ultimate objective pursued at European level is thus to establish a level playing field. Asylum seekers should have access to protection under equivalent conditions in all Member States  that is the first precondition. The goal pursued in the first stage was to harmonise Member States legal frameworks on the basis of common minimum standards, but the goal in the second stage should be to achieve both a higher standard and greater equality of protection across the EU, as well as greater solidarity between Member States.  It will be necessary to identify existing gaps and deficits and to pursue further legislative harmonisation while guaranteeing high standards. For example, models need to be explored for the design of a single procedure for assessing applications for refugee status and for subsidiary protection. It is also necessary to reflect on the need for fuller harmonisation and clarification of the European rules regarding the reception conditions granted to asylum seekers.  Reflection is also needed on whether the criteria for allocating responsibility currently applicable under the Dublin system should be complemented in order take other factors into account, such as more equitable distribution between Member States on the basis of their capacity to process asylum applications and to offer longterm prospects to recognised refugees. This is a very important point, raised by a number of Member States, particularly by our Maltese friends, who stressed the importance of integrating the current Dublin regulation. I am studying this point. Based on the results of this wide debate and after a public hearing to be held on  18  October with the full involvement of Parliament, I will issue a policy plan at the beginning of  2008 . The policy plan will set out further measures to construct the comprehensive asylum system along with a timeframe for adoption. I am confident that with the due institutional framework which will fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process  I refer to the codecision procedure  we will be able to match this high level of ambition.  On the specific issues addressed in Mr Pirkers report concerning practical cooperation, there is a need to enhance converge of practice between Member States. Training is certainly one of the areas where practical cooperation is taking place. At the moment, the development of a common curriculum is under way. We will establish a first pilot Europeanwide portal on the exchange of country of origin information by the end of this year, in a few months time. For the time being, this will only connect some of the existing databases and will be accessible to selected national authorities, but my services also intend to carry out a feasibility study on how to provide a better structural support to practical cooperation activities; the idea is to have a European support office.  It should be remembered that the European Refugee Fund can provide, through Community actions, financial support to Member States to implement projects, in cooperation with the United Nations, to improve the quality of their asylum systems. In the new World Programme for  2007 , specific mention is made of this point.  The Commission has also proposed to amend the European Refugee Fund, precisely to provide rapid financial support to those Member States that face particular pressure because of sudden arrivals of migrants at their borders, some of whom are in need of international protection. In addition, the new budget line Preparatory action: Migration management  Solidarity in action, which is the name of the project, will be used to assist Member States faced with particular difficulties. We will fund it with a supplementary amount of money of about EUR  7  million.  Finally, of course, as the rapporteur has just said, one of our main political objectives is to make a clear distinction between economic migrants on the one hand and true refugees on the other. Thus, there will be credible European policies for the return of thirdcountry nationals who are staying illegally, in full respect of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
1879436 author: Frederic Merx:  Mr President, I am really very pleased to be here today to discuss with you this very important topic of how we can improve consumer confidence in the digital environment.  I would like to start my speech by thanking Mrs Roithov and all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent and very close cooperation  and this is not just a matter of courtesy, but a sincere recognition of very hard work.  I am glad that the Commission and the European Parliament agree on a common line in approaching this very important and challenging issue. This is clearly an important and ambitious report, and I think we all broadly share the same objectives and analyses of the problems.  The digital economy  and more specifically ecommerce  has great potential to improve consumer welfare by making a greater range of products available, boosting price competition and developing new markets. It is also central to completing the retail side of the internal market. At present, retail markets are still fragmented along national lines into minimarkets, as Mrs Roithov indicated. This makes no sense in the age of ecommerce and the internet. Ecommerce is changing the face of retail, but only at national level. The internet is borderless but consumers, businesses and regulators are not. Fifty per cent of European consumers who have a computer at home have made an ecommerce purchase in the previous  12  months, but only  12  of those with a computer at home bought crossborder. This indicates the need for action to increase consumer confidence on the retail side of the internal market and the necessity to solve the fragmentation of the market to achieve finally a citizens market.  As you know, since the beginning of the year we have launched two major initiatives for consumers: the consumer policy strategy and the consultation on the review of existing consumer protection legislation. Our objective as a Commission is to help the EU rise to the challenges of growth and jobs and reconnecting with its citizens. This objective will be met if, by  2013 , we can credibly demonstrate to all citizens that they can shop from anywhere in the EU  from corner shop to website  confident that they are equally and effectively protected.  The need to improve consumer confidence in the digital economy runs through every aspect of this strategy. Mrs Roithovs report shows that the obstacles  including regulatory obstacles  are numerous. My predecessors made progress in tackling some of them with the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation, which established the European Consumer Centre (ECC) network. My priority now is to tackle the remaining obstacles, with the reform of existing consumer protection legislation related to consumer contracts.  As you know, we have initiated a broad consultation on the future of consumer protection, and we have started to analyse reactions from the stakeholders. We are looking forward to Mrs Petres report after the summer. Your views and your support will be an important reference for our followup work and for specific proposals. The Commissions followup to the review of the acquis is a basis on which build consumer trust. The development of standardised consumer contracts may be something to investigate further once this solid base is established.  One of the aims of this exercise is to reduce the regulatory fragmentation of the internal market by targeted harmonisation of issues that cause particular problems for consumers and businesses. We will, inter alia, consider whether standards and standardisation can play a role in this process.  Similarly for selfregulation. The Commission has done some important work to establish a best practice model for self and coregulation, and we will continue to do so in the future. I share your concerns about the interplay of different legislation governing online transactions or digital goods. There are many precise laws, and consumers and businesses may not be sufficiently aware of their rights and duties in the digital environment. I will examine how best to clarify these issues with my colleagues, Mrs Reding and Mr McCreevy.  Thanks to your input, we will explore the idea of a practical guide which would cover information society services and help citizens to understand their rights better. I would also like to thank you for insisting on the importance of enforcement  I fully agree with you. Quality legislation is not enough if it is not backed up by effective enforcement. We have set up a network of national enforcers in the European Union and we will now gradually enlarge the network to third country partners in order to enhance its efficiency.  In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your commitment to helping European citizens to enjoy all the benefits of the internal market and the digital economy. I look forward to working with you to fulfil our common goals and to achieve a citizens internal market.
4620996 author: James Green:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission has on many occasions declared  and, through its actions, proved  its commitment to ensuring that the legislative framework on genetically modified food and feed, which was approved by the European Parliament and the Council, is fully respected. We have the obligation  and I believe we are delivering on this obligation  to make sure that the legislation is properly and fully respected. Under the legislation, GM food and feed can be legally put on the market only if it is safe and appropriately labelled.  I would remind the House of how the legislation provides for the division of work between risk assessment and risk management. The Commission has no discretion on the safety assessment of a GM product. The legislation clearly distinguishes between risk assessment, which is carried out by EFSA, and risk management, which is carried out by the Commission. This approach is defined not only by general food law but also by the Regulation on GM food and feed.  Whenever new scientific questions emerge, the Commission adheres to the separation of competences and asks EFSA to evaluate the information and its impact on the risk assessment of a product. The Commissions role is to take relevant risk management decisions, provided that, and only when, such a risk is identified by EFSA as the European Unions body responsible for risk assessment. In other words, we manage a risk once it has been identified and assessed by the body responsible. It was a very specific decision, when the legislation was adopted, to give the risk assessment to a separate independent body. However, if there is no risk identified by the Authority, then there will be no sound scientific basis for the Commission to take a risk management decision.  On this specific issue, MON  863  had already been evaluated twice in  2004  before the authorisation was adopted. In both cases, EFSA concluded that MON  863  maize would not have an adverse effect, and this opinion was reached with the involvement of the national authorities of the Member States and was further reviewed and confirmed by the Authority in  2006  following a specific request to the Commission by the honourable Member Ms Breyer. There were intensive repeated analyses, which were carried out as part of the authorisation procedure, and then there was the publication by Professor Sralini in March this year  that is the sequence of events.  The work presented by Professor Sralini was not a new study but only a statistical review of the existing ratfeeding study, which supported the authorisation of this product in the European Union. Despite the fact that it was not a new study but only a statistical review, as soon as the Commission became aware of Professor Sralinis paper, it immediately asked EFSA to analyse it to verify whether the newly proposed statistical interpretation was well founded and, more importantly, whether the statistical differences were relevant for food and feed safety.  In order to take into account all new elements and thus to eliminate any possible sources of uncertainty, EFSA conducted a new review asking Member States to provide any relevant analysis or comments, set up a specific task force of internal and external statistical experts and held a meeting with the author of the statistical review. In the Commissions view, the procedures set up by EFSA to evaluate the review of Professor Sralinis report represent a sufficient guarantee of independence and expertise. EFSA first responded to the Commission request in March by discussing the issue at the plenary meeting of the GMO Panel, before issuing a statistical report and a scientific statement by the Panel on  20  June.  In particular, the Authority underlines that the statistical analysis made by the authors of the paper did not take into account certain important statistical considerations and that the assumptions underlying the statistical methodology employed by the authors led to misleading results. The conclusion of the Authority is that the paper does not present a sound scientific justification to question the safety of MON  863  maize and, therefore, it sees no reason to revise its previous opinions that MON  863  maize would not have an adverse effect in the context of the proposed use. Parliament will be informed in more detail of the background I have outlined in the replies to the written questions on this subject by Ms Breyer, which are currently being finalised following the recent EFSA statement.  Against this background, two conclusions emerge. First, and most importantly, there is at this stage no scientific basis to question either the safety of MON  863  or its status as a legally commercialised product. Second, the conclusions of the EU official body for risk assessment, made up of some of the best specialists in Europe, have been drawn after consultation of the national competent authorities as well as external experts. By trusting the outcome of this work, which confirms the previous evaluations, the Commission has, I believe, acted as a responsible risk manger, especially within the context of the legislation and the apportionment of responsibilities as I explained them during my introduction. The Commission will continue to work along these lines on the basis of a precautious and sciencebased approach.  The Commission, I would emphasise, has full determination to make a casebycase risk management decision taking into account any scientific questions emerging during the evaluation procedure or even after the authorisation. We will always be vigilant; we will always be ready to examine every new piece of scientific information that emerges. But, of course, our final decision will have to be based on the risk assessment, which will be done by the body in charge of this responsibility based on European legislation.  We believe that our legislation and the Commissions approach offer the best way to provide our citizens with the high level of safety they expect and demand. I hope that I can count on the trust and support of the European Parliament as we continue our rigorous and impartial approach.
4320271 author: Sebastian Corless:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, I know that the GMO authorisations are a sensitive issue but, first of all, we have to remind ourselves that, based on European legislation adopted by Parliament and the Council, GMO products are allowed in the European Union, provided they go through the authorisation procedure I have just described.  That authorisation procedure provides for the risk assessment to be done by EFSA. So, whether some of us agree or disagree with the concept of GMO products, we are all bound by the European legislation. This is the rule of law so we have to follow it.  First of all, on EFSAs work, as you know, Parliament was informed and I came along myself as well. We have taken decisions on improving the work of EFSA to make it more thorough and to take more account of the views of the Member States and all scientific developments that may take place during the authorisation procedure. The Commission adopted an action plan which has been put in place already and is being implemented and which will also be included in the legislative framework sometime in  2008 . It is part of the Annual Policy Strategy for  2008 . There we take into account how we can improve the situation and make proposals based on the views of the Member States and on longterm effects and many other aspects.  I also have to insist that in the European Union we have the highest standards and the strictest legislation when it comes to GMO products. That is why you know we have continuously been taken to the WTO and are not doing so well there.  But nevertheless our legislation has been accepted by the WTO because it is sciencebased and the decisions are based on risk assessment so, in this way, we can fulfil our international obligations by taking into account primarily and foremost the safety of European consumers and European citizens. So it is not a question of personal preferences but an issue of applying the existing legislation.  I know Mrs Breyer referred to those questions. There is a procedure. We have to get information. You will be provided with all the details on these questions. But again the questions arising are linked to the risk and the risk is not being assessed by us. It is assessed by EFSA. Therefore, we have to wait for the decision of EFSA on this issue before we actually provide the replies.  On this specific product there were many evaluations and many studies. They all caused EFSA to reevaluate and reassess its position and it came to the same conclusions. So it was not something taken lightly. It was not something that was ignored. Whenever there was new science and new evidence, this was taken into account and we asked EFSA, which again is the risk assessor of the European Union, to take them into account. It is true that EFSAs latest opinion was based on the existing study but also Professor Sralinis paper was on the same study. It was a question of how you analyse, how you do statistical analysis of the existing data and that is why we had a special task force on statistical analysis, internally and externally, and it came to the conclusion that there were flaws in the analysis and the conclusions of Professor Sralini. That does not always mean that he who is negative is always right. Sometimes people who are positive as well may be accurate and correct.  Finally, as to the issue of which studies the authorisation would be based on, the decision was that we would continue with the legislation that was originally adopted; that the applicant has the responsibility of providing the data and the studies information. In this way, they have the burden of proof which is assessed by the authorities. The authorities can ask for any further additional studies they would like and in this way they have the responsibility of proving their case. I will not go into the issue of the cost of eventually changing the system. The cost will eventually be a burden on the taxpayers of the European Union and not the industry. But the main reason is they should have the burden of proof and therefore the authority can analyse this data based on a critical analysis.  I would like to remind you that a similar situation is used in the EMEA, the medicine authority of the European Union, where again the industry provides all the clinical trials and clinical studies and the decision is taken.  So I can assure you that we take into account and we will make sure that the EFSA takes into account and assesses and evaluates any new scientific evidence that may arise and the moment a risk is identified we will not hesitate to take the appropriate measures. As you know, we have done that and I personally have done that in the past on many occasions with unauthorised products.
4794095 author: Amy White:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, let me say straight away in response to Mr Markov that I am grateful to him for acknowledging the increased flow of information that comes from the Commission to his committee and the stronger cooperation that he has seen. As far as China is concerned, the EU side has as its objective in the prospective Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to lay the foundation for enhanced cooperation, including enforcement and, where possible, the upgrading of environmental  including climate change mitigation  social, labour and safety standards, so we are on the same wavelength on that.  I welcome this opportunity to give this House some feedback on recent developments in bilateral trade relations with China. China has been a top priority since I took office. We have a lot to gain, but also some things to lose, depending on how we conduct this important relationship.  I chose the European Parliament last October to present, together with Commissioner FerreroWaldner, the Commissions China strategy paper  Closer Partners, Growing Responsibilities  and, more specifically on trade and investment, the policy paper entitled Competition and Partnership. I argued in that policy paper that Europe benefits from an open and balanced economic relationship with China based on fair reciprocity.  That fundamental argument still holds good today. Our economies are complementary: China has strong competitive advantages in many areas; we have an enduring competitive advantage in high valueadded services and goods, especially ones that require strong intellectual property right (IPR) protection.  However, we have not yet achieved the balance in our relationship that will guarantee that it can be sustained to our mutual benefit. Europes trade deficit with China is indeed growing. I accept that part of this deficit may be the natural result of market forces, but we also know that our export potential is being hampered by barriers in the Chinese market and that an important part of the current trade balance is consequently artificial. It is a product of politics, not economics; it can be addressed by politics. A recent study has even put a number on the cost of Chinas barriers to our trade at about EUR  20  billion annually in lost exports, that is  30  of our exports to China. China must take practical steps to address the problem.  So what is the EU looking for? Well, we want improved access to Chinas goods and services markets and, for EU investors, a sea change in protection of intellectual property rights and copyrights, especially by cleaning up the huge street markets that sell counterfeit products and by ensuring Chinese companies pay royalties due to EU companies when using their technology.  We want an ambitious approach to negotiations to update the  1985  Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement between the EU and China. This has to be a genuinely highstandard agreement that addresses longterm concerns, and we want assurances that the drive for growth and the lack of domestic market signals in China will not lead to overproduction and dumping, especially in key products like steel.  The fundamental case for a positive trade relationship with China remains correct, but we are at something of a crossroads in our trade relations with China. A policy of dialogue to address the problems we have is credible only if it delivers more than the alternative means of trying to force change.  The policy of dialogue and engagement can be challenged. It will be challenged if things do not improve between us and if people cannot see tangible, deliverable, practical improvements and benefits as a result of that policy of dialogue and engagement.  So let me repeat: openness to China is in Europes interests, but it is sustainable only if we can show that EU products and services are just as welcome in China as Chinese goods are in Europe. That is why China needs to reciprocate by strengthening its commitment to economic openness and market reform behind its own borders.  I have made this case openly and frankly to the Chinese authorities, most recently with Commerce Minister Bo Xilai in our recent EUChina Joint Committee meeting in Brussels on  12  June. At that meeting, the Chinese leadership recognised for the first time that the current trend of the trade imbalance between China and the EU is simply not sustainable. I was able to agree with Bo Xilai to set up a highlevel group that will explore ways to address this issue. I am looking forward to the initial report of this group at the next EUChina summit in November, and I expect it to identify some first tangible and practical steps to address this shared challenge, notably in ensuring higher Chinese imports from the EU.  I agreed with Minister Bo Xilai on  12  specific points that address EU companies concerns regarding their access to the Chinese market. One of these was the agreement on terms of reference for the upgrading of our  1985  trade pact. This was an important step forward, as I had withheld our commitment until I felt the terms of reference were right from our point of view.  It is important to stress that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of which our trade discussions are forming part will encompass the full scope of the EUChina bilateral relationship, including enhanced cooperation in political matters. The PCA will contain a standard clause on human rights. The clause will cover all issues related to democratic principles and fundamental human rights. As I have already said, one of our objectives in the PCA is to lay the foundation for enhanced cooperation on matters to do with environment, social, labour and safety standards.  On the trade side, the agreement will cover important issues for both sides such as IPR, investment, nontariff trade barriers, capital movements, sustainable trade, and natural resources and competition. These negotiations are an important tool to try to rebalance our trade relations and create opportunities for EU business operators. However, this is not a preferential agreement, and tariffs will, therefore, not be discussed.  In parallel, the European Commission will continue to monitor closely Chinas implementation of its WTO accession obligations. This will remain a central priority for the Commission in the years to come. Chinas nonaccession to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement leaves important Chinese markets closed, and China needs to honour its commitment to open negotiations on accession to this agreement in  2008 .  The Commission will also launch a comprehensive review of market openness in China and Chinas implementation of its WTO commitments later this year. IPR was another focus of my talks last month with Minister Bo Xilai. Cooperation and dialogue on IPR issues are not an end in themselves. They have to produce real change. Talk is not enough. That is why the Commission has made it clear to China that the cooperative approach we are presently favouring must produce tangible results.  The next meeting of the EUChina IP working group should be held in the coming month. If significant progress is not made in the shortterm on key issues for the EU, such as fake markets and payment of royalties, we will have to reconsider our approach with China in the IPR area. The Commission does not exclude using the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO. In addition, the Commission is working actively to stop Chinese exports of fakes from entering the Community, most notably through strengthened customs actions at EU borders. I believe this must become a higher priority for the EU as a whole.  Europe can cope with tough competition, but it needs to be fair competition. This means that we have to ensure that we are acting on a level playing field, rejecting anticompetitive trading practices and standing ready to apply our trade defence instruments against dumping and illegal subsidies, as well as stepping up the fight against counterfeiting.  I should also like to share with you key elements of our updated assessment of Chinas request for market economy status. This issue is important in the context of the EUs application of its trade defence instruments when faced with allegations of unfair dumping in Europe by Chinese exports. The updated assessment reflects the significant and welcome steps of China towards becoming a market economy. Progress was recorded across the board and brought China closer to fulfilling the four outstanding market economy status (MES) criteria. In particular, we think that the adoption of a number of important laws deserves recognition  the bankruptcy law, the new property rights law and the new accounting standards. However, the updated assessment also makes clear that still further progress is needed. None of the four outstanding criteria has been fully met. In particular, proper implementation of the new pieces of legislation will be crucial. It is not enough to pass new laws. They, as I believe Chinas state authorities understand, must also be used and respected. We will review the situation again in  12  months and continue technical talks in the meanwhile.  I value the views of this House very highly and I am committed to providing early and clear information to you. Where possible and appropriate, this has been done in writing, for instance the MES assessment has been transmitted to the Committee on International Trade. On other occasions, it may be more appropriate to provide information orally because of its sensitivity. This is fully in line with Article  19  of the Framework Agreement. What matters is that I will continue to keep Parliament fully informed.  To summarise my approach, I believe in a balanced partnership between the European Union and China based on fair reciprocity, a partnership whose core task is to open markets to fair trade for the benefit of Europe, China and the wider world. I believe the EU has been playing its part in delivering that partnership. It is right that we insist that China should play its full part as well.
2642227 author: Amy Brown:  rapporteur.  Mr President, I am happy for this report to be debated jointly with the report on the eurozone. I would add that the report I am presenting was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  Starting with the economic situation, in  2006  the economic recovery in the eurozone became a selfsustaining process with domestic demand acting as the main driver. Two million jobs were created in  2006  and unemployment fell from  8 . 4  to  7 . 6 . In the context of this recovery, I would like to stress the main points of the report. Against the background of the recent recovery, any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth. It is crucial that wages increase in line with productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a noninflationary environment. Fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve longterm growth.  The report observes that small economies have performed better than large economies since the creation of the eurozone in terms of growth, with notably Ireland, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg and Spain achieving a higher average growth rate than the eurozone average and we say that lessons might be drawn from such developments. The report expresses concern about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major European currencies. Article  111  of the Treaty assigns responsibility for exchange rate policy to the Council but without specifying how this responsibility should be exercised.  The report calls on the Eurogroup, the Council and the ECB to exercise their respective powers and responsibilities in full coordination. The report also calls on the ECB to monitor closely developments in the use of the euro as a reserve currency for central banks and, in the context of its annual report on the international role of the euro, to quantify and analyse the effects of this, particularly as regards exchange rates. Mr Trichet will be aware that every time he has appeared at Parliaments Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee during the last two years I have raised with him the issue of house prices. This remains a concern of mine. Therefore, the report calls for the ECB to monitor closely these developments, which have the potential to have consequences for the real economy. The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages, such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets.  I refer later on to the Fed formula. Perhaps it is time to develop an ECB formula to help forecast the likely effect of interest rate increases on house prices. My report also raises the issue of subprime lending and suggests that lessons can be learned in the EU from the potential difficulties for the US economy of subprime lending.  I would like to take a moment to address an issue of particular concern to Ireland but which has potential interest for other eurozone members. Last year in Ireland house prices were forecast to increase by  9  by estate agents Hook and McDonald, by between  8  and  10  by Sherry Fitzgerald and by  7  by Friends First and IIB, while Allied Irish Banks forecast an increase of between  3  and  6 . The recent Irish Permanent tsbESRI index shows in fact that house prices fell by  2 . 1  between January and May  2007  and a further decline in Ireland is expected. Subprime lending  that is lending to poorer people, those with an irregular income stream or difficult history of meeting loans  is projected to grow to EUR  4  billion in Ireland this year. If the average loan was between EUR  200   000  and EUR  400   000 , then between  10   000  and  20   000  such loans exist in Ireland alone. Subprime lenders are relatively new to the Irish market and generally charge about twice the going mortgage rate to compensate  as they put it  lenders for higher risk. In one case a mortgage company operating in Ireland since  2005  has already repossessed  30  homes.  There are also signs of concern in Britain about subprime lending. It has been known for some time that there is a Fed formula in the United States. The Fed formula devised by the US Federal Reserve, according to one of its former economists, shows that typically, when house prices have been driven up for several years by low interest rates, when interest rates increase, prices begin to decline roughly  18  months to  2  years later. I believe that the ECB should follow this formula and develop an ECB formula because, at present, we are leaving it to people who are involved in the industry to make the forecasts, and they are the people  the financial institutions and others  who have most to gain.  The report urges the Commission to assess the quality of supervision and offshore location of hedge funds. It reiterates points made in the past about democratic scrutiny and the need to publish summary minutes. It draws attention to the fact that overdraft rates in the euro area vary from  7  to  13 . 5  and asks that the ECB evaluate this.  It ends by saying that the number of banknotes in circulation stood at  11 . 3  billion with a value of EUR  628 . 2  billion last year, but that it is concerned about the growth in the number of  50  euro,  100  euro and  500  euro banknotes.  500  euro banknotes alone have increased by  13 . 2 . My report, with the support of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, raises the possibility of criminal activities in the use of these large banknotes and says that it requires further examination by the ECB. I hope Mr Trichet will be in a position to respond to this report and, in particular  not today, but perhaps over a certain period  to consider my suggestion about an ECB formula to equate with the Fed formula so that there can be a true and accurate measure of the likely knockon effect of interest rate increases on house prices in the Member States of the eurozone.
5781460 author: Frederic Finlayson:  ECB Chairman. Madam President, I have five points to make in response to the question. First of all, I should like to say again that the reports by Mr Rosati and Mr Mitchell were very impressive and full of very important ideas and recommendations.  First, on Mr Schwabs remarks: it is clear that there is a question of institutional philosophy. There are  13  exemplary political democracies in the euro area, and next January there will be  15 . In the future, there may be  25  or even more. It is inconceivable that changes would occur three or four times a year because of changes brought about by the normal functioning of our democracy. Clearly, commitments made within the Eurogroup are either kept or they are not. If they are not kept, then it is impossible to have a Eurogroup which has authority  which, I am sure, is the wish and the will of all the countries concerned.  My second point concerns jobs. Figures are figures. I regularly hear that the euro is not designed to create jobs, that we have a problem with growth and jobs and so forth. The euro was created on the basis of a philosophy that is shared the world over: that price stability, and credibility in ensuring price stability, are prerequisites for sustainable growth and job creation. That is the decision that Europeans have taken, but they are in good company, because it is a consensus. What are the figures? More than  12  million jobs have been created since the euro was set up  more than  12  million; two million, as the rapporteur said very eloquently a moment ago, were created in  2006 . Since the euro was launched, we have created more jobs even than the US. We have the lowest unemployment rate for  25  years. We are not satisfied, and we are right not to be satisfied, because we have to do much better. However, let it not be said that the euro is playing against job creation  it is not true, and we can prove it.  As regards the obsession we might have with price stability, I have already said that price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. Let me also say that this sentiment is fully shared by our fellow citizens. All the surveys show that they are fully in favour, by an incredible margin, of price stability, and that they are not necessarily fully satisfied with the present situation; they are encouraging us to be as credible as possible. If, today, we have a  50 year rate of  4 . 67  and a  30 year rate of  4 . 65  (the  50 year rate applies to France, where bonds are issued for  50  years, and the  30 year rate to Germany), these figures are still much lower than the  10 year rate in the United States. Why are they so low? Because we are credible  on ensuring price stability over  30  years and, even, over  50  years. That is the contribution our credibility makes in Europe.  Let me mention the exchange issue, which is very important. Firstly, the rules are clear  they are set out in the Treaty. They are exactly the same as the rules in operation in Germany since the foundation of the Bundesbank after the Second World War. They are exactly the same as those used under the French system introduced in January  1994 , when the Banque de France became independent, as called for by the Treaty of Maastricht and agreed unanimously by the French Left and Right, who decided, as Mr Goebbels said, to change the Constitution of the Fifth Republic to make the central bank independent.  So, the rules are clear. They are the same as in a number of countries. In practice, as has been said here very eloquently by an honourable Member, this means that we are in a floating exchange rate system, and we have a forum to discuss those matters: the G 7 . To my knowledge, JeanClaude Juncker and I signed the G 7  statement, together with our US partners  the Federal Reserve as well as the Secretary of the Treasury  with our Japanese partners and with our other partners, the UK and Canada.  This is how we have discussed matters since the establishment of the floating exchange rate system. That is not to say that the situation is easy or very nice, but let us be as responsible as possible in the present circumstances and let us be sure that we have this dialogue  between ourselves, certainly, and with our partners. It is inconceivable that we could do things that would be contradictory to our partners wishes. It will not work.  Madam President, I do not want to bore you by restating what we have said, but together we are saying to China that we are not satisfied with the present situation. We are, certainly, echoing what has been said by our Japanese friend, that the markets are not fully recognising their present fundamentals, and, as regards the United States, we said together that we noted that the Secretary of the Treasury and the monetary authority had said that a strong dollar visvis the euro was in their interests. I shall not say anything else on that point, but we have to know exactly what the situation is.  I come now to the last point, which is also an important one: independence. I noted with great attention the fact that all governments in Europe have said that they would fully respect the independence of the Central Bank. JeanClaude Juncker, on behalf of the Eurogroup, said that a moment ago. Independence is in the Treaty and is the absolute key for credibility. How could we be credible over the next  50  years if we were not deemed independent by all those who are taking decisions  here in Europe, in New York, in Tokyo, in Singapore, in Hong Kong and elsewhere? They trust us because we are independent, but independence is not only based upon full respect of the Treaty by our partners, the executive branches, it also depends on us. I wanted to say, on behalf of the Governing Council  if I could I would say it in several languages to make sure I was well understood!   (FR) I will preserve most firmly the independence of the ECB in all circumstances. My  18  colleagues and I intend to adhere strictly to the Treaty on this point, as on all the others. It will be about the Treaty, the whole Treaty, and nothing but the Treaty.  (DE) As President, I am firmly committed to maintaining the ECBs independence in all circumstances. My  18  colleagues and I intend to adhere strictly to the Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty.
2707941 author: Mary Merx:  Member of the Commission. Mr President, since the last debate in this House, the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has profoundly changed.  There are several developments that we should welcome. Israel has finally resumed the transfer of tax and customs revenue, the European Union has decided to normalise its relations with the Palestinian Authority and there is now a new Palestinian Government headed by Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. After a threemonth interruption, the bilateral meetings between Abbas and Olmert have resumed. Finally, like many others, I was delighted to hear that the BBC correspondent Alan Johnston had been released after more than three months in captivity.  On the other hand, after the Gaza takeover by Hamas, there is now a high risk of separation between parts of the Palestinian Territory. The people of Gaza are being isolated from the world, and the tensions between the Palestinian factions have never been so high. The creation of a viable Palestinian State is, at least, at risk.  We must continue to work on the development of a political perspective in order to provide peace and prosperity for the region. I hope that the upcoming bilateral meeting between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert, which, it is to be hoped, will take place on  16  July, will help to frame a credible political perspective for the Palestinian people and that it will pave the way for their joint meeting with the Quartet later on.  I hope that the Quartet can continue its cooperation with the Arab partners, and I look forward to the upcoming meeting of the Quartet, which will most probably take place next week, when all these issues can be discussed. I welcome the appointment of Tony Blair as Quartet envoy, which will certainly further dynamise our role in the Middle East peace process. He can become a new vector of progress along with the Arab Peace Initiative. I will, of course, provide him with every possible assistance, as we did for Jim Wolfensohn, including the staff for his team in Jerusalem.  With regard to assistance, the Commission has been quick in reacting to the new situation. I received a letter from Prime Minister Fayyad, which describes his priority needs. We are ready and are, of course, already mobilising our assistance to provide support to the new Government. The Quartet and the General Affairs and Foreign Affairs Councils have endorsed the extension of the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) until the end of September. In order to fund TIM operations in the third quarter, we have sent a request to the budgetary authority for a transfer of EUR  80  million. I am delighted, and I thank you that the Committee on Budgets has this week agreed to this transfer. We are now able to provide support, through the TIM, until the end of its extension. Direct financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority is already being prepared in the form of a scheme to reimburse private sector arrears, as Salam Fayyad has asked us to do. This would have a doubly beneficial effect on the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority and of the Palestinian private sector. We are identifying some funds for this.  The Commission has resumed its longstanding efforts to build the institutions of the future Palestinian State. We are also providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance. A project to assist the Ministry of Finance in the area of internal control and audit has just been launched, and we will launch two more shortly. One is the management of customs, and the other the management of tax revenue.  Finally, a few words on Gaza. We will not, of course, abandon the people of Gaza or the goal of a viable Palestinian State. We are providing humanitarian and emergency assistance to the people of Gaza, and ECHO partners are working on the ground. The TIM is delivering social allowances and fuel. However, the situation may deteriorate further because access to the Gaza Strip is still a problem. Therefore, we have to work even more with the Egyptians and the Israelis in order to open the Rafah and Karni border crossings. Their continued closure impedes the effective passage of humanitarian personnel and goods and it is to be hoped that this will not have devastating consequences for the economy of the Strip.  Finally, border crossings have to be open both for humanitarian access and commerce. If the economy collapses, there will be serious implications for the security of the whole region, for the future of the Palestinian State and, indeed, for the Commission budget. We should not let the population of Gaza become  100  dependent on external aid.
7547197 author: Christoph LaCourt:  on behalf of the PPEDE Group.  Madam President, I very much appreciate the comments and the content of the Commissioners response here this evening. I have to say it is nothing less than that I would expect from her. I found during the whole DCI process, often when we got bogged down, that the Commissioner certainly was of great assistance in trying to move that situation on, as was her colleague, Commissioner Michel.  I am glad also to hear what she had to say about the annual action programmes because we really do need to deliver on the letter that Commissioner Ferrero Waldner and Commissioner Michel sent to Mrs Morgantini and myself as rapporteur on the DCI, because in that letter it was clear that Parliament would decide for itself what structures it would set up and the programmes and strategy papers it would examine.  I have to say also that given that the DCI was only approved last December and it is very much a new process for all of us, Parliament has hit the boards running. Where it has been hit and miss, I have heard some very bad reports of the attitude of some people in the Commission in relation to annual action programmes. In my own experience as chairman of group C, examining some of the Latin American countries, I have to say that the cooperation has been very good. And I think the Commissioner should encourage the continuation of good cooperation because it creates a good atmosphere all round and creates a very good working relationship. It allows us all to bring our best experience to addressing the issues which we all want to address, being the Millennium Development Goals and the needs of very poor people in a suffering part of the world.  I want to underscore the importance of the present period. A lot of work has been done by the Commission and by Parliament to enable the EU to better implement its development policies. Throughout the negotiations on the development cooperation instrument, we made it clear that we did not want to be involved in micromanagement. Micromanagement is for the Commission and Council but we do want to have oversight. It is right for Parliament to have oversight and the Commission should not fear any involvement of Parliament in that vein. We, the Commission and the Council should be partners in seeking to be effective, and not competitive and seeking to keep things secretively to ourselves. How can we cooperate to effectively deliver assistance to the countries we are trying to assist?  The first steps of the new DCI framework are being taken and we all have responsibilities to get it right. DCI has formalised structures, recognising the important function that Parliament should play in its role as overseer and adviser. We have worked hard scrutinising the strategy papers prepared by the Commission and to formulate positions on different aspects of those strategies. I expect the Commission to give careful consideration to effect our positions on the strategy papers.  As part of our oversight role, we must insist that policy continuously focus on the achievement of the MDGs, which aim to alleviate some of the worst forms of poverty in the world. Parliament continually needs to receive assurances to its satisfaction.  I was very impressed at the beginning of the year to hear from the German Presidency that they would forward the ACP papers to Parliament in the same way as they had forwarded the papers for the Asian and Latin American countries.  Now I understand that one Member State  although perhaps I am being unfair in this  raised some objection to that. I know there is a multiplicity of these papers and it sounds very good that this should be addressed in some way by the JPA or the ACP member states. But, unlike Parliament, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the African, Caribbean and Pacific House of that Assembly are not constantly in session, and the structures are not there to cope with that level of scrutiny.  We have three standing committees and perhaps we could on some selective audit basis pick some aspects of these and examine them. But that should not in any way interfere with the need of Parliament here to take what documents this Parliament wishes and to scrutinise them in the best way possible.  Our objective should always be to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We are not in competition. We can work together. For two years, during the development cooperation instrument process, we tried to persuade the Commission and others that we were really in the business of trying to find a really good instrument. Eventually, when we were listened to, we found that instrument.  Commissioner, do not listen to bad advice. Do not listen to people who are creating obstacles. We are in the same team. We want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Do not keep from Parliament information that it should rightly have in its oversight role. You will find that we will respond generously and effectively and helpfully.  Thank you very much for your contribution here this evening.
3907533 author: Lynne Cameron:  Member of the Commission. Madam President, it is a pleasure to come before Parliament to exchange views on the Geringer de Oedenberg report on the role and effectiveness of cohesion policy in reducing disparities in the poorest regions of the European Union.  Once again, as in the case of other owninitiative reports adopted by the Committee on Regional Development, this proves the excellent collaboration between our two institutions. I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Hbner, who has had to go to Romania, and she sends you her best wishes.  I welcome this report and I appreciate its positive contribution to the debate on the impact and effectiveness of cohesion policy at a critical moment of the  20072013  programming period and on the eve of the budgetary review to be carried out in the year  200809 . I fully share the view that the cohesion policy is not only essential but also effective in reducing socioeconomic and territorial disparities and in tapping the development potential of all EU regions.  The value added of cohesion policy has already been proved, and we all recognise that it goes well beyond financial transfers to include, among other things, the development of partnerships, exchanges of best practice, budgetary stability and a strategic approach.  I particularly appreciate the theme and the content of your report because it touches on the backbone of cohesion policy. Indeed, the main goal of our policy is to reduce the socioeconomic and territorial disparities in the poorest EU regions. The challenge is not negligible. These disparities have dramatically increased following the recent enlargements, and cohesion policy is the only Community instrument specially designed to this aim. For instance, disparities in GDP per head between the top and bottom  10  EU regions have almost doubled after the two most recent enlargements.  In fact, regional disparities in the EU are very important, much more than within the United States or Japan, or of a similar dimension to that in China and India for instance.  Despite impressive growth rates in the new Member States and the convergence of many regions of the EU 15 , there are still  70  regions  home to  123  million Europeans  with a GDP per head below  75  of the EU average. In addition, there are a number of regions  the majority of which are among the most developed ones  which are losing ground. In  27  regions, GDP per head declined in real terms between the years  2000  and  2004  and, in another  24 , growth was under  0 . 5  per year.  Nevertheless, as explained in full in the recently published Fourth Cohesion Report, convergence is taking place. This is due both to the accelerated growth of most of the new Member States and to the sometimes sluggish performance of some of the most advanced ones. On the whole, the periphery of the EU is catching up with the core of Europe not only in terms of GDP per head but also of employment, productivity and other indicators, and this is good news. This includes the former cohesion countries which, with the exception of Portugal, in the last few years have experienced impressive progress.  This phenomenon  the longterm convergence process  is especially occurring at EU level between Member States and regions. We know that, at national level, the picture is somehow different, since in many cases growth is increasingly concentrated in the capital region or in the main metropolitan areas, which deepens the internal disparities and causes problems related to agglomeration, like transport congestion, pollution, housing price rises and so on.  Let me underline the substantial contribution of our policy to this overall positive convergence process. Independent evaluation studies have shown that cohesion policy has supported muchneeded investment in infrastructure, human resources, modernisation and diversification of regional economies. Between  2000  and  2005 , public investment in the four cohesion countries has been around  25  higher than it would have been without cohesion policy. It has contributed to the growth of GDP. Increasing GDP levels attributable to regional policy ranged from  10  in Greece and  8 . 5  in Portugal in the period  19891999 , and  6  for Greece and Portugal,  4  in the German Lnder and  2 . 4  in Spain in the period  20002006 . Preliminary estimates for  20072013  suggest an impact of between  5  and  9  in the new Member States.  It has also contributed to reduced social exclusion and poverty. Cohesion policy cofinances the training of nine million people annually. More than half of them are women, leading to better employment conditions and higher income. For example, over  450   000  gross jobs were generated in six countries: Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Between  2000  and  2005  it accounted for two thirds of Objective  2  funding. It has helped shift the policy mix of public investment in Member States towards growthenhancing investment.  According to the most recent data, the amount of cohesion investment earmarked for research and development, innovation and information and communication technologies (ICTs) for  20072013  has more than doubled in comparison with the years  20002006 . Clearly, it remains to be seen how these plans will be implemented, but we already see, among both the Member States and the regions, an increasing awareness in their development strategies for the next financial period.  Certainly, one of the keys of this success lies in the fact that cohesion policy is an integrated, fullyfledged policy; it is not a sectoral policy, or a disjointed bundle of sectoral policies, but an integrated instrument aimed at delivering specific tailormade solutions for each European region or territory. At the same time, it is not just an EU policy that operates in isolation but it certainly depends on the active involvement of partners at national, regional and local level.  Your report correctly points to a number of issues which are particularly relevant for the poorest regions if they are to make the best use of the allocated funds. I shall mention just a few likely to provide them with appropriate technical assistance. The importance of designing tailormade development strategies, or the value of implementing effective partnership and encouraging good practices.  I took note of your proposals. I am convinced that some of them will find their way into the current legislative framework that has given rise to the new initiatives recently adopted by the Commission, like the three Js  Jasper, Jeremy and Jessica  or Regions for economic change. The flexibility of cohesion policy makes it possible to implement the best measures adopted for each case. In this regard, Mrs Hbner will ensure that the Commission pays particular attention to the needs of the poorest regions in the ongoing negotiations on the programming documents for the years  20072013 .  I also appreciate the contribution of your report to the debate on future cohesion policy, which was launched by the publication of the fourth cohesion report. I welcome these valuable recommendations aiming at increasing the efficiency of cohesion policy.  As you know, we are now at the initial stage of reflection on the future of cohesion policy. This debate aims at nurturing the review of the EU budget that the Commission has to undertake in the years  2008  and  2009 .  In conclusion, you are aware that the public consultation on the future of cohesion policy will be launched following the cohesion forum to be held at the end of September. A dedicated internet site will collect the contributions of Member States, regions, cities, EU institutions, economic and social partners and, of course, civil society organisations. The Commission intends to present the results of this consultation in spring  2008 , together with the fifth progress report on economic and social cohesion. On the basis of this and other owninitiative reports recently approved, I am very much looking forward to Parliaments contribution to this debate.
7075838 author: Lynne Cameron:  Commission. Mr President, the Commission shares the European Parliaments concern about the violation of human rights in Vietnam. This affects, in particular, the exercise of freedom of expression, of association and of religion. However, we must view this in its full context. Vietnam has made considerable progress in terms of economic and social rights. Over the past decade, it has succeeded in lifting a significant part of its population out of absolute poverty and set the country firmly on a course of economic growth, whilst limiting the emergence of socioeconomic disparities within the population.  This has been accompanied by some improvements in recent years in the situation as regards civil and political rights. For instance, new legislation relating to religious freedom, which has been adopted in the last three years, has softened some, but not all, of the tools used by the state to control religious organisations and thus allows nonorganised groups to seek official recognition.  This has already had a positive impact on the ground. Among other things, some Protestant denominations, such as Baptists and Mennonites, which had not been recognised in the past, have been able to register grassrootslevel congregations.  That said, the implementation of the new legislation remains uneven, and progress in the Northern Uplands in particular has been markedly slower than in parts of the Central Highlands and in lowland areas. Moreover, some denominations seen as dissident by the regime, such as the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, and some Hoa Hao and Cao Dai groups, remain illegal and face continued harassment.  The climate has also improved for political dissidents in the past two years. A considerable number of highprofile activists were released in  2005  and  2006 . Last year also saw the emergence of some new parties and other groupings of activists within the country, which was unprecedented both in terms of the number of groups and of that of their adherents. The official reaction to this development was, initially, relatively lowkey. However, this changed in early  2007 , and in particular since midFebruary. Harassment of dissidents seems to have intensified, and scores of activists were arrested. A number of them have since been tried and sentenced to lengthy jail terms. This includes some wellknown persons such as Father Nguyen Van Ly, and lawyers Nguyen Van Dai and Le Thi Cong Nhan. We do not know whether this is a temporary reflex or something more deepseated, but it is of grave concern to the Commission.  The EUs relations with Vietnam have developed dynamically in recent years, and the Commission has taken every opportunity to press for continued improvement in the human rights situation, especially as regards prisoners of concern. The Commission and EU Member States representatives in Hanoi have in particular followed the recent arrests and trials of activists with particular attention. EU diplomats were present at some of the trials as observers, and the EU reacted strongly to their sentencing. In its declaration of  15  May, it reiterated its plea to the Government of Vietnam to release all nonviolent political activists exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association. The EU missions in Hanoi have also requested that the Vietnamese Government allow them to visit dissidents in prison, in order to ascertain the conditions of their detention.  The recent trials were also raised forcefully by Commissioner FerreroWaldner in her bilateral meeting with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Khiem on  28  May  2007 , on the margins of the ASEM ministerial meeting in Hamburg. Apart from highlevel political contacts, the EU and Vietnam have agreed on mechanisms to conduct a dialogue and exchange of views on human rights issues. A key instrument in this regard is the regular human rights dialogue between the EU missions in Hanoi and the Government of Vietnam. The SubGroup on Cooperation in the Areas of Institution Building, Administrative Reform, Governance and Human Rights provides another opportunity for the Commission to raise these issues.  On all possible occasions, we have expressed our view that the arrest of nonviolent political activists is incompatible with Vietnams obligations under the international human rights instruments to which it has acceded. Please rest assured that the Commission will continue to use all instruments at its disposal to press the case in question, as well as, more generally, to encourage and support progress on human rights and religious freedom in Vietnam. We also rely very much on the European Parliament to continue to press for the improvement of human rights in Vietnam.
7531513 author: Claire Reid:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, we as the European Commission join with the European Parliament in strongly condemning the killing of the African Union peacekeepers in Haskanita, and in other incidents over the past year, and, of course, the fact that many others are still missing.  We should not pretend that even the larger peacekeeping force due to take over from the current African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) will be able to protect itself easily to ensure the vast humanitarian operation supported by the European Commission and so many other donors and to keep the peace if there is no peace to keep. This is the question.  We acknowledge the acceptance by the Government of Sudan of the presence of the UN peacekeeping force on Sudanese soil. Along with the rest of the international community, we intend to keep the Government to its word. We welcome the intention of the Government to declare a cessation of hostilities when negotiations commence in Libya on  27  October, yet the Government needs to go further. The European Commission also calls upon the Government of Sudan to engage meaningfully in negotiations intended to result in the equitable sharing of power and of wealth in Darfur. We join with the rest of the European Union in calling upon the rebel movements themselves to declare an end to the killings and banditry that sully their cause. We also call upon them to participate wholeheartedly in the talks in Sirte.  On top of that, as you know, UN Security Council Resolution  1778 , adopted on  25  September, mandates an international multidimensional force to contribute to the stabilisation of eastern Chad and the northeastern Central African Republic and thus also guarantee the security of the local civilian population, refugees and displaced people and stabilise the situation in Sudan.  On this basis, the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council on  15  October decided to send an interim and multidimensional European force of  3   000  troops, EUFOR Chad, as we call it, to support and complement in the short term the deployment of the UN contingent. Taking into account the regional dimension of the Darfur crisis, the deployment of this new EUFOR Chad mission and of a UN police mission in parallel with UNAMID in Sudan is, I think, a crucial step towards facilitating a durable solution of the conflict in Darfur and, ultimately, also towards the voluntary return of the Sudanese refugees who have settled in Chad. I can tell you that, at this very moment, an Irish General is there exploring the situation and exploring where exactly EUFOR should be deployed.  But coming back to the question of Sudan itself, let me say that we firmly believe that the future of Sudan lies in the sharing of wealth and power, in a federal government and a federal arrangement. This is what the Government and the rebels agreed in Naivasha in January  2005 , when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, ending decades of civil war between the north and the south. The international community must stand firm behind this Comprehensive Peace Agreement. For if this agreement can be made to hold  yes, it is at present in difficulty, but these difficulties need not be terminal  this will demonstrate powerfully that similar arrangements can surely be extended to Darfur.  So through the support extended also under the European Development Fund for the recovery and rehabilitation of southern Sudan and for the longterm equitable and sustainable development of the whole of the country, we are standing firmly behind the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We also back the efforts of the EU Special Representative to Sudan to facilitate peace in Darfur and, along with other donors, we stand ready to ensure that the peace dividend, in the shape of the rehabilitation and recovery of Darfur, follows closely on the heels of a renewed peace agreement.  We think it is in the interest of all the parties  the Government, the Darfur rebels, the countries of the Horn of Africa region and the international community  that Sudan stays together. However long and arduous, and at times discouraging, the Sirte talks might turn out to be, I think we must be steadfast for peace in Sudan. The unity of this country remains within our grasp.
4727249 author: Frederic Bush:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I would like to warmly thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work they have carried out regarding the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS)  8   Operating Segments, the new standard on segment information.  After the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued the standard in November  2006 , a debate ensued concerning the suitability of IFRS in the European context. This debate was useful. We had to make sure that the European Union would not adopt a new accounting standard just for the sake of convergence with the equivalent US standard, but mainly because it improves the quality of financial information and is conducive to the European public good.  Before reaching a final decision, the Commission and Parliament agreed in May  2007  that the Commissions services would carry out an analysis of the potential consequences of adopting IFRS  8 . They ran a public consultation during July and August and gathered the views of stakeholders on the costbenefit implications and the overall impact of adopting IFRS  8 . On the basis of almost  200  contributions, my services have prepared a report which was provided to Parliament on  10  September  2007 . The reports main conclusion is that the benefits of adoption of IFRS  8  would outweigh its costs. Further, many constituents stressed that a swift endorsement of IFRS  8  would remove uncertainty about the treatment of financial statements for the period ending in December  2007 .  Let me stress that we did not ignore the concerns that had been raised regarding the introduction of the socalled management approach, which gives management more leeway compared with the existing standard on segment reporting. Some constituents were concerned that IFRS  8  lacks strict requirements on detailed geographical information because it allegedly does not require sufficient detail on a countrybycountry basis. Discussions with constituents revealed, however, that IFRS  8  is rather expected to improve this kind of disclosure. Further, it seems that particular concerns in this area, in our view  and in the view of the majority of respondents to our consultation  cannot be resolved through a financial reporting standard on segment information. This could be better done through a further development of a framework regarding corporate social responsibility aspects.  We agreed that IFRS  8  should not be adopted solely for the sake of convergence, yet we believe that it is crucial to see the issue also in the broader context of the European Union adopting a set of standards which are truly global. A couple of years ago we all agreed that Europe should not opt for its own set of standards but rather support and promote the development of a high quality and global set of standards like IFRS.  We are working on improving the governance of the IASB. On  7  November the European Commission, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Japanese Financial Services Agency made a joint statement announcing their agreement to seek certain changes to strengthen the institutional framework of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) Foundation. These changes are intended to strengthen the accountability of the Foundations trustees, in particular by replacing the current selfappointment process for the appointment of the trustees with a process in which public authorities are responsible for the final approval of trustees.  The joint statement also recognised the importance of further strengthening the IASBs due process, including by carrying out impact assessments. This agreement provides a strong basis to address the concerns expressed by this Parliament. It also reflects the issues identified by the Commissions two monitoring reports to ECOFIN concerning the IASBs governance. We will work with the IASC Foundation and the international partners to develop more detailed proposals in the coming months. We will, of course, maintain a close dialogue with the European Parliament throughout this process. I am confident that the outcome of this process will ensure that standards respond to European needs and are easily acceptable and applicable by all stakeholders in the EU and also globally.  Let me conclude. The swift adoption of IFRS  8  is important for two reasons. It improves the quality of financial information and it provides certainty to all market participants. The discussions of the last months have demonstrated that a stronger involvement of the European Parliament in the endorsement process is necessary. The Commission will also continue to work with the IASB and the IASC Foundation and with our international partners to ensure that the process of developing international accounting standards is fully accountable, transparent and meets the needs of European stakeholders.
8789774 author: Philip Merx:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, Pakistan is on the agenda of this plenary for the third time within a few months. This bears witness to the very difficult transition the country is currently going through. The imposition of emergency law by President Musharraf on  3  November in his capacity as Chief of Army Staff has sent a deeply worrying signal to Europe and the wider world and has damaged the course of democracy in Pakistan.  Before the emergency was imposed we had witnessed some encouraging developments, with hope for a more inclusive political process and stronger democratic institutions, but regrettably this has now been put in question and today we ask ourselves whether this situation is still reversible or whether it is not too late to restore confidence and conditions in advance of the parliamentary elections.  President Musharraf, in his televised address on the night of  3  November, told us that he was suspending the Constitution because of threats to the nation due to a visible ascendancy in the activities and incidence of terrorist attacks. There is no doubt that Pakistan is currently facing a very serious threat of religious extremism and violence as recent events in the NorthWestern Frontier Province and the attack on Ms Bhuttos convoy on  18  October in Karachi have clearly demonstrated. But what we are also witnessing now is the arrest of thousands of lawyers, journalists, political party workers and human rights activists, including such distinguished persons as Ms Asma Jahangir, the Chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, or Mr Aitzaz Ahsan, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association.  These are people who stand for an open and tolerant Pakistan. They are not terrorists and it is wrong to detain them. They should be set free immediately. I would regard the drastic action taken against Pakistans judiciary as particularly serious. Rule of law is at the heart of any democratic process and the functioning democratic system cannot be sustained without an independent judiciary.  The statement by the Presidency, just mentioned also by our President on behalf of the EU, is therefore very clear, and this remains our position. Last Sunday President Musharraf announced at a press conference that he hopes parliamentary elections can be held in Pakistan by  9  January  2008 . This would be a step in the right direction but there are a lot of remaining problems. When can we expect the state of emergency to end? How can we have free and fair elections when print and electronic media are censored, other civil rights and liberties suspended and the independence of the judiciary has been undermined? How will parties be able to campaign when freedom of assembly is curtailed and party leaders like Benazir Bhutto are kept under house arrest? These issues are not at all clear at this stage.  To end this uncertainty it is of fundamental importance that a firm date for elections should be announced as soon as possible, along with a clear timeframe for ending the emergency. For these elections to have any chance of being at all democratic and transparent, it will be essential for all restrictions on political rights and fundamental freedoms to be lifted. And, as things stand, at present it seems it will not be possible to deploy an election observation mission. Certain minimum conditions laid down in the Commission communication on EU election assistance and observation for the holding of democratic elections are not met.  However, if the emergency rule was lifted rather quickly and conditions were significantly improved soon, I might yet be able to review the situation. In any case I have made the necessary preparations for possible deployment of an EU election observation mission to Pakistan should the conditions noticeably change for the better quickly. But, as I say, I am very much concerned as to whether this is likely to happen.  There have been calls to suspend or review our aid to Pakistan, and some EU Member States have taken steps or are considering some action in this respect. The European Commissions support to Pakistan focuses, I would like to remind you, on key issues such as poverty reduction and education, including in the NorthWest Frontier Province and Baluchistan, which are the most disadvantaged provinces in Pakistan.  Therefore, I think we will need to consider how best to proceed but, given the nature of this assistance, I think we have to reflect very carefully on that.
822213 author: Victor Corless:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, firstly I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Braghetto, and to the Committee on Fisheries for this report, which raises the issue of the recovery plan for bluefin tuna.  The Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna is a key stock for the Community. As confirmed by scientific advice, this bluefin tuna stock is now at high risk of collapse. All the states involved in this fishery have agreed to the need for urgent measures to ensure the sustainability of the bluefin tuna stock and of the fishery.  I am convinced that the recovery plan adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas in  2006  represents a realistic chance for the gradual recovery of bluefin tuna if it is fully respected. Therefore, decisive and effective action is immediately necessary at Community level. The speed of the implementation of the ICCAT recovery plan is an absolute must, both for conservation reasons and to safeguard the common fisheries policys credibility and the credibility of the EU fishermen themselves. The objective is to have the proposal agreed at the November Council.  During discussions held in the context of the Council preparations, many changes were introduced to the original proposal, some of which go in the direction of your suggested amendments. I am sure that we are in agreement on the objectives of urgently taking measures to eliminate overfishing and to ensure strict compliance with ICCAT measures, in order to bring the bluefin tuna stock to sustainable levels. This will, at the same time, improve the profitability of the fishing industry in the long term. Apart from the benefits to industry, there is also an international political commitment that we are obliged to fulfil.  Turning now to the report, I appreciate and share the Fisheries Committees view that the Community needs to address the excess fishing effort of its fleet. The Commission also considers that the annual fishing plan is an effective instrument to avoid overfishing because of the overcapacity of the Community fleet.  In this context, the Commission can accept Amendments  1 ,  2 ,  7  and  8  concerning the establishment of annual fishing plans to ensure a balance between the fishing effort of the Community fleet and the quotas. A relevant provision on this issue has been introduced in the Presidency compromise.  In addition, the Commission asks the Member States concerned to include in their operational plans a reduction of their fishing capacity, either temporary cessation or scrapping, to ensure that their quotas for  2008  and the following years are fully respected. I recognise that we are asking the industry to make considerable sacrifices, but these are necessary to ensure the longterm sustainability of the fisheries, fleets and coastal communities concerned. The choice is between shortterm sacrifice and the collapse of the stock.  Moreover, I totally agree with you that, in order to alleviate the socioeconomic impact that will be caused by the reduction in fishing activity, it is necessary to ensure financial compensation for the industry. A provision on the related financing measure in line with Amendment  5  has also been introduced in the Presidency compromise. I am aware that there are other concerns. I share many of those concerns and know that they too will need to be addressed.  With respect to Amendment  3 , let me state first of all that I am well aware that the number of cages for tuna fattening has increased greatly since  1990  and that their capacity exceeds the total sum of the TAC available.  ICCAT has now adopted a strict regulation in order to ensure the sustainable development of farming activities for bluefin tuna. The next step will be to regulate the number of farms. The Commission fully supports the adoption of the recommendation made by the ICCAT Working Group on Capacity in July  2007 .  This recommendation proposes the implementation of a freeze on boat fishing capacity and farming capacity for bluefin tuna. We need to wait for the final results of the ICCAT discussion being held in Antalya this week. That is the reason why the Commission cannot accept, at this stage, the amendment concerning the limitation of farming capacity.  On the derogations relating to fishing areas and minimum size, I would like to remind you of the context within which such derogations were accepted by ICCAT. All contracting parties have agreed these derogations as part of the package on the recovery plan. These derogations were granted for artisanal fleets and for some seasonal fleets because their impact on catches is insignificant. In addition, these derogations include a series of strict conditions, such as a limited number of vessels, limited catches and designated ports. Having said that, the recovery plan may be revised in  2008  on the basis of new scientific advice or weaknesses detected in its implementation.  At this stage, the Community has a responsibility to ensure that the recovery plan is incorporated in Community legislation to ensure its full implementation. In this context, I cannot accept Parliaments amendments on the deletion of the derogations, that is Amendments  4  and  6 , or Amendments  12  and  13  on the renaming of the plan, the modification of the EC quotas and the introduction of a new payback system. These amendments are not in line with the recovery plan adopted by ICCAT and the ICCAT rules on payback.  Similarly, I cannot accept Amendment  10  regarding traps, since the proposal does not include measures to address this issue. For the first time, the recovery plan regulates trap activity and this will, in future, enable an evaluation of the impact of this fishing activity on the stock.  Regarding Amendments  9  and  11  relating to the harmonisation of sanctions and the possible closure of a national fishery of a Member State where it fails to respect its reporting requirements, let me say that, whereas we fully understand and share the spirit behind this proposal, we cannot accept the amendment in this context, as the proposal does not include measures that address the issue. The issue is one of general policy and the Commission will examine it in the forthcoming  2008  reform of the control framework of the common fisheries policy.  We consider that documentation and transmission of information to the Commission at set times is a crucial element for the success of the bluefin tuna recovery plan, and it is also a prerequisite if we are to monitor the uptake of the EU quota in real time. The Commission has therefore opened infringement procedures against all seven Member States which take part in the bluefin tuna fishery for shortcomings in data transmission.  In conclusion, let me state that we are deeply concerned about the overshoot of the quota by some Member States, which undermines the credibility of the Community at international level and jeopardises the success of the bluefin tuna recovery plan.  At the meeting of the Compliance Committee, which took place in Antalya on  8  and  9  November, the contracting parties  notably the United States and Canada  criticised the lack of compliance with ICCAT rules. As expected, the European Community was severely criticised for overshooting the TAC in  2007 .  At the same time, the contracting parties acknowledged the difficulties for the European Community fleet in adapting to the reality of the recovery plan, which entered into force in  2007 , and welcomed the European Community proposal on a specific payback regime. The Compliance Committee has adopted a specific recommendation concerning a payback system for the overshoot of the EC quota in  2007 , which comes to  4   440  tonnes, based on an EC proposal.  In accordance with this recommendation, the overharvesting of the European Communitys quota in  2007  will result in a yearly deduction of  1   480  tonnes from its annual quota for the period  20092011 .  In addition, the Compliance Committee agreed that the figure for the European Community was provisional and may be subject to review and eventual adjustment as a result of ongoing investigations. This recommendation will be adopted by ICCAT during its plenary session on  18  November.  Nevertheless, we have to reassure the ICCAT parties that the European Community will do its utmost to ensure that quotas allocated to the vessels of our Member States are scrupulously monitored by those Member States and by the European Commission, in order to ensure respect for the quota set for  2008  and the forthcoming years.  Following the adoption of this regulation, the Commission is resolved to work closely with the Member States to ensure and closely monitor the full implementation of the bluefin tuna recovery plan. The Community Fisheries Control Agency will also play an active role. The agency has started the preparatory work for the coordination of control and inspection activities by Member States, with a view to having everything in place for the  2008  bluefin tuna season.
8721285 author: Lynne White:  rapporteur.  Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs. That a report of this scale has received no plenary amendments shows this is truly a report from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and one we can all be proud of. I would also like to thank the Commission for its close cooperation and the Portuguese Presidency for making social policy a priority for its Presidency.  We face a huge challenge in Europe. That challenge is one of fairness. It is about lost potential, the inability to live a life free from the charity of others, and a life free from discrimination, poverty and social exclusion.  Our objective is clear: we want to expand opportunities so that nobody, whatever their background or circumstances, is left behind. The vision of Europe must be freedom and opportunity for all, increasing opportunities and incentives to work, whilst strengthening the safety net for those who are unable to work.  In  2007  the facts are chilling:  72  million European citizens continue to live in poverty;  8   of all people in the European Union now suffer from inwork poverty. Those are truly shocking statistics. But what do they actually mean? They mean that one in six citizens is now living below the poverty line  one in six! Many people would not believe that could be possible in  2007 . Fifty years after the Treaty of Rome, after  50  years of economic growth,  10   of people belong to households where nobody has a job! By any measure, poverty remains one of the greatest social problems challenging Europe, and reducing social exclusion must be at the heart of our policies.  In some areas we are succeeding, but we must be frank: in the majority we are not. The gap between the rich and the poor in many EU Member States is increasing. The elimination of incomerelated poverty must remain a priority for Member States but, for the one in six who live in financial poverty, there are many more who are excluded from society for other reasons. We have to recognise that for many families  for many individuals even  there are problems more complicated than simply low income. Barriers to opportunity are complex. More than anything else, early intervention is crucial. Prevention, of course, is better than cure.  In the UK, we know that the daughter of a teenage mother is three times as likely to become a teenage mother herself; we know that sons with a convicted father are over four times more at risk of being convicted of a crime than those without a convicted father. Yet, in many areas, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. We must look at how other EU countries deal with these issues and learn from them. We must share best practice more effectively. Finland, for instance, has introduced a holistic sustainable approach that has been incredibly effective in reducing the number of people who are homeless. Denmark, meanwhile, is implementing new policies that improve the quality of life of longterm roughsleepers, rather than having the sole aim of integrating those individuals into mainstream society. In Belgium, people who have experienced poverty are working with social workers to help them better understand the needs of poor people.  It is not always unemployment that causes poverty: inwork poverty is a problem as well. That is why I have called for an exchange of best practice on the provision of a decent working minimum wage throughout the Member States. At least five EU Member States do not even have one. Equally, we must push all Member States to adopt a minimum living income for all.  Member States must do more to prevent exploitation of vulnerable workers as well; to make sure that disabled and older people have a way into employment; to prevent trafficking; to safeguard the rights of asylumseekers; to ensure equal access to healthcare and community services for all; to destigmatise people with mental health problems; and to promote a more constructive approach to drugs and alcohol.  These are but a few of the issues this report has addressed. Europes vision must be freedom and opportunity for all. That is why it is so important to look at setting up mechanisms at a European level so that the exchange of best practice becomes a reality.
6254659 author: Alastair MacLeod:  rapporteur.  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs very much for their good collaboration on this report.  Energy efficiency is vital for cutting carbon emissions, enhancing security of supply and boosting economic efficiency. In October  2006  the Commission produced an action plan for energy efficiency, proposing a  20  improvement in energy efficiency by  2020  and setting out  10  priority areas for action. These ranged from appliances to buildings and transport and included financial incentives, energy efficiency awareness and much more. EU Heads of State endorsed the Commissions action plan last March and energy efficiency made the headlines because Chancellor Merkel declared that inefficient incandescent light bulbs should be banned.  Now it is the Parliaments turn to assess the action plan. I hope that our report will send out a strong signal about what MEPs want to see happen on energy efficiency. The first signal that this report makes is that some of the Commissions proposals do not quite go far enough. I would like to give three examples. Firstly, the proposal to revise the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive: the Commission proposes minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and for building components, which is good. Buildings are key to cutting energy demand. Over  40  of the energy we use is consumed in buildings and  75  of the buildings standing today will still be here in  2050 , so we need to tackle energy efficiency in existing buildings as well as in new stock. But we should not just be lowering the  1   000  m 2  threshold in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive  we should be getting rid of it altogether and applying the Directive to all buildings requiring heating and cooling, regardless of size. We also need to bring forward the deadline for a passive house standard for residential and nonresidential buildings across Europe. It is not good enough just to have this as a mediumterm goal.  Secondly, on appliances, Parliaments report welcomes the proposal to put in place minimum energy performance requirements coupled with a dynamic system of energy labelling, to keep up with advances in technology. But our report calls on the Commission to come forward with a onewatt performance requirement for standby, and to carry out an analysis of the potential energy savings to be made from eliminating standby altogether. Our report also urges the Commission to set a timetable for taking completely off the market some very energyinefficient items of equipment, such as patio heaters.  Thirdly, the report calls for more help for small businesses, which are particularly affected by rising fuel prices and in need of energy efficiency. Unfortunately, both the EU and national financing schemes tend to be complex. It is fine if you are a big company, but if you are a microbusiness with a handful of employees, you do not have the capacity to access complex programmes. Small businesses need to be treated like domestic households and offered simple schemes and upfront money.  So that is the first message of the report: that we need to go a little further. The second big message is that there has been a failure by both the Commission and national governments to implement existing energy efficiency legislation. The Commissions action plan for saving  20  by  2020  is not a standalone plan. It builds very heavily on previous legislation, and the implementation of this legislation has been a disgrace. The Buildings Directive has only been properly transposed by a handful of Member States. Six months after the  30  June deadline, a third of Member States have still not submitted their national energy efficiency action plans. The Commission has not put in place all the  20  extra staff it said were necessary to deliver energy efficiency commitments and, for that reason, the timetable on the action plan has slipped.  I would, however, like to thank the Commission for responding in a very positive and constructive manner to the criticisms voiced in this report and, in particular, the exchange of letters between Commissioner Piebalgs and Ms Niebler, which has brought an update to Parliament on the situation.
7426878 author: James Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Members for their interesting comments, which demonstrate once again that we share the common objective of eliminating this appalling practice.  As I stated before, our proposal will be gradual but effective. Realistically speaking, we simply cannot bring about a discard ban overnight. However, as one speaker said, doing nothing is not an option. And, undoubtedly, during the course of this year we will be coming up, hopefully, with three legislative proposals on reducing discards for specific fisheries, apart from incentivising and encouraging Member States to come up with pilot projects, by virtue of which we could achieve the introduction of a reduction in discards or even, possibly, discard bans.  The example of Scotland, which was adopted by the Council in December, was a very laudable one.  Concerning the point that was made on positive incentives, I agree that these are important, but we need to find the right mix and the right levels, because otherwise they could be counterproductive, and we could end up with a situation whereby we encourage more catches when, for sustainability reasons, we would want to reduce them in order to reach MSY levels.  I would also like to point out that I could not agree more that our proposals must be tailormade to the specific fisheries and must contain inbuilt incentives, as I said, and support for the changes in behaviour that fishermen will have to adopt.  Indeed, already, in our TAC and Quota Regulation, we adopted incentives for fishermen to adopt more selective methods, thus avoiding discards.  In the very first intervention and in others that followed, the point was made that discards are caused by the common fisheries policy. I would like to state that this is not really correct, because the causes of discards can arise form the high grading of fish by fishermen for the purpose of getting better quality fish, which is done independently of quotas, and the catching of juveniles, which is also independent of quotas. It is only where there is exceeding of catch quotas, and again this depends, because if it is a clean fishery and the quota is exceeded, then the quota is set for purposes of sustainability.  It is, in reality, where you have a mixed catch, and you have one of the types of catch which has a low quota for sustainability reasons, and the other catches targeted, that you have discarding of fish as a result of the TAC and Quota Regulations.  These are the aspects which we would like to address in order to introduce more selective gear, so that the catches can become even cleaner  which is one of the methods whereby discarding could be effectively reduced.  I would also like to point out that, according to FAO estimates, discards within Community waters are around one million tonnes. Worldwide they are around eight million tonnes. These are very conservative estimates. When one takes into consideration that the system that we operate is producing less than one tenth of all discards  taking into account the TACs and quotas  I think that there are various other factors which contribute to discarding apart from the system operated by the common fisheries policy.  Having said that, we are actively seeking ways and means whereby we improve the management so that the TACs and quotas operate in a way whereby discards are reduced to an absolute minimum or are completely banned.  Finally, on the point raised concerning Mauritania, I would like to say that we have just signed a new memorandum of understanding with Mauritania, and this will lead to a new protocol which will guarantee for Mauritania the same amount that they have under the existing protocol but which will reflect the actual fishing possibilities in a more realistic way.  So we will be paying Mauritania to help it strengthen its fisheries infrastructure and its economy in general under the development funds, so that, in that way, Mauritania is guaranteed the full amount. But at least what we pay for fish would reflect the actual amount of fish that it is possible to catch in Mauritanian waters.
571219 author: Sarah Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, first of all, please allow me to take a little more time, because this is a very important issue for me.  First, let me commend Ms Gomes and all the other Members of Parliament involved in the preparation of this important report. Ms Gomes has visited Iraq twice since December in order to get the clearest possible picture of what is and what is not happening in the country. I have sent my two directors in charge of the area to Iraq, one of whom, Mr Toms Dupl del Moral, is here with me today. I will tell you more about that later.  Ms Gomess analysis is clear, comprehensive and above all it starts from the right place. We have no choice but to deal with the challenges Iraq faces now and in the future.  Five years after the fall of Saddam Hussein we may be entering a new phase of a gradual process. However, the process is still fragile, limited and unstable.  The security situation seems to be slightly better, partly as a consequence of the US surge, but also because of two other important factors: the activities of the Sunni Awakening Councils, armed and paid by the US, and most importantly Moqtada alSadrs ceasefire, which has now been extended for another six months. The number of deaths among Iraqi civilians still remains very high and there is great uncertainty about the sustainability of these efforts and of improvements. Turkish incursions in the north contribute to complicating the situation, no matter how calm and measured the central and the Kurdish regional governments reactions may have been  at least for now.  On the political front, the Legislative Council approved an important package of laws: the  2008  budget, the provincial powers law and a limited amnesty related to the debaathification process, thereby giving satisfaction to Sunnis, Shias and Kurds. However, with the Presidential Councils rejection of the provincial powers law, there is still uncertainty as to whether this limited progress can be consolidated.  The economic front shows a total reliance on the oil sector, difficulty in attracting foreign and even domestic investment, and lack of job creation opportunities. Collection of taxes and tariffs is very incipient and the amounts remain marginal. The capacity to spend the investments planned in the budget, while growing, is still limited. However, economic activity, including investments, seems at this stage to have more potential in the safest Kurdish area.  National reconciliation remains central in the political agenda and there are many initiatives and foreigndriven events. However, while domestic efforts to build up genuine Iraqi ownership and perspectives on the future of the country continue, a shared and clear vision is still lacking, and efforts are guided by sectarian, religious or ethnic interests, considerations or grievances. This is also what my director reported to me.  Let me take this opportunity to remind you of what we are already doing in and with Iraq and what we can set out to do under still difficult circumstances in the future. Our intervention extends over a wide range of activities covering the political, economic, assistance and humanitarian aspects.  First, the trade and cooperation agreement: it is a political endeavour, setting the basis for contractual relations between the European Union and Iraq for the first time. Our hope is that this will help Iraq to address its own reform agenda and facilitate its reintegration in the international community after years of isolation. We have just wrapped up the fourth round of talks. Rapid progress continues on areas from human rights to combating terrorism, from energy cooperation to the environment.  Secondly, the neighbours meetings, which the PresidentinOffice of the Council mentioned, could contribute very substantially to reducing interference, improving security and allowing political dialogue and reconciliation among the various factions. I have personally invested a good deal of effort to help this happen, having participated in two conferences, in Sharm el Sheikh and in Istanbul. I will continue to do so in the future if I can, to keep pressing home the need for Iraqs neighbours to take up their responsibilities. Visits to Baghdad by the SecretaryGeneral of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, and most recently even the Iranian President are to be taken as good signs in this direction.  As Ms Gomes points out in her report, the task of helping Iraq stand on its own feet cannot fall on the shoulders of the donor community or the Iraqis alone.  On the subject of assistance, I need not remind this House that the EUR  829  million of Community funds devoted to Iraq since funding started under my predecessor in  2003  were committed with the full support of the Council and the European Parliament.  We have never been naive about the difficulty of delivering an effective programme in Iraq. We did as this Parliament and all our Member States recommended, by working with the UN and its agencies, with the World Bank and the multidonor Trust Fund. Working with them was the only viable option available. The United Nations had an extremely hard time after the assassination of Sergio Vieira de Mello and a good part of its staff when its office in Baghdad was blown up. The new Special Representative, Staffan de Mistura, has taken on his job with remarkable commitment and is highly appreciated. You recently met the Deputy UN Special Representative, David Shearer, and I think you had a good exchange of views on their mission and the risks still existing.  I could mention many projects, but I shall do that when I answer your questions later on. At the moment I shall just say that I think it is important substantive work, all the more important given the very limited capacity  and I agree with Ms Gomes on this  of the Iraqi Government to deliver results. From basic needs in health and education, through assistance with democratisation, elections and human rights promotion, to humanitarian and refugee support, we have persisted with an extremely comprehensive programme, using the best available means in the most challenging circumstances.  We have tried to ensure that specific attention is paid to the needs of vulnerable groups, not least displaced Iraqis, whether inside Iraq or in the neighbouring states. Last year a substantial package of EUR  50  million was provided for refugee support. The Commission also intends to allocate EUR  20  million from its humanitarian budget line for  2008  in support of IDPsrefugees and the most vulnerable groups in Iraq. We have also started some bilateral projects, but there is no ideal solution. In fact, every option has inherent and formidable drawbacks.  As I have already mentioned  and I am coming to a conclusion  last week on my instructions, my two directors responsible for Iraq from the External Relations DG and EuropeAid visited Baghdad with their teams. They held fruitful but very frank discussions with the Iraqi authorities and other players. The mission confirmed Iraqs precarious security, the political and economic situation that I described earlier, the extreme weakness of the Iraqi institutions after Saddam Husseins years and the ensuing war, and the key role of our small delegation in Baghdad.  The Iraqi Government expressed its eagerness to work with the European Union. On this basis, we shall try to fund, alongside other bilateral and international donors, and we will help to strengthen the institutions and the capacity of the administration of a state which remains weak. We shall explore ways of taking more direct action as Parliament has asked  bearing in mind the security environment  and we would like to ensure the maximum efficiency, visibility and accountability of our assistance.  (Applause)
8431634 author: Katarina Whittacker:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very important and interesting contributions, and when we finalise our white paper on adaptation we shall take into account what has been expressed today and what the resolution of the European Parliament is recommending.  I would like to underline that, without the continued support of the European Parliament, most of our policies that are in place today would not have been adopted, and the leading role of the European Union in the world would not provide the hope that an international agreement will be achieved in Copenhagen in  2009 .  It is our main objective to have an international agreement to fight climate change, and to adapt to changing climatic conditions, in which all the countries of the world will participate and especially the United States and other big emitters, because then the fight against climate change will be effective. Of course, the European Unions efforts will not be enough, but we cannot hope to have an international agreement if we do not take active leadership regarding this.  I heard again today some doubts about science. I think this issue has more or less been dealt with. There is almost a consensus in science that climate change is anthropogenic: it is caused by human activities. There are a small number of scientists who think differently. Some people still think that the world is flat, but even in the United States that is not taken seriously any more.  Last week a report from the World Health Organisation underlined the impact on health caused by climatic conditions and changes in climate, and NASA warned us that climate change is happening faster than we thought. Therefore, relying on what science is telling us, we have to act.  Concerning cost: if we act later, we shall pay more; if we act now, we shall pay much less and we shall also avoid the irreversible impact of climate change on our planet. We have a duty to ourselves and to the next generations to leave the world in at least the same condition as we inherited it.  We also have a moral duty, which many Members stressed, towards those who have not contributed to the formation of the greenhouse phenomenon  the leastdeveloped countries in the world, which not only have a very low income per capita but also have contributed only a very small fraction to the formation of this phenomenon.  Therefore adaptation, along with efforts for mitigation, is absolutely necessary, and we have to do that by helping the leastdeveloped countries and also by taking the right measures in the European Union.  I heard various examples of what is happening right now, for example in the important issue of water. We have legislation  the Water Framework Directive  which deals with this very precious and scarce resource, but we also adopted very recently a communication on water scarcity and droughts, because this is becoming a very important and urgent problem that we have to deal with.  Again concerning the cost, a few speakers mentioned the question of auctioning and how this will affect our energyintensive industries or other sectors of the economy. I should like to clear up one misunderstanding to defuse this issue. The revenue that will be generated by auctioning will not go to the European Unions or any other coffers, but will go to the ministries of finance of the Member States which will auction the allowances. This should be clearly understood. This money could be between EUR  30  billion and EUR  50  billion every year, and we have recommended  and I hope that the European Parliament will agree  that part of it should go to adaptation policies. So we have the funding ready if we have the political will to go ahead with accepting this principle that we earmark a certain amount of this EUR  3050  billion per year to go to adaptation policies.  I would like to speak for longer, because this is a very big issue and many questions were asked, but I would like to thank you again for your contributions. We will continue to cooperate closely with you and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change in formulating our policies and working hard, especially during these two years, to achieve an international agreement in Copenhagen.
2663161 author: Philip Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I would like to reply and answer the oral question on behalf of Commissioner Mandelson, who was not able to attend today because he is in the process of deep bilateral negotiations on the Doha Round.  The US case against European support for Airbus and the European case against US subsidies to Boeing are currently at the WTO Panel stage and the European legal position has been defended. We are now expecting the interim reports in both cases in the fall or winter. The next steps will be determined by the outcome of the dispute and by the underlying interests which led to it.  On the question of how this affects the ability of the industry to compete, we would like to say that we see no reason why the pending EU and US litigation in the WTO over support to Airbus and Boeing should affect the ability of European industry to compete fairly and in public procurement competitions with the United States.  Government procurement is about providing the best equipment, at the best value for the taxpayers, in the tanker procurement. The US Air Force has determined that the plane offered by Northrop Grumman and the EADS is superior to the Boeing and is the best tanker to meet its needs. The question of support for Airbus is immaterial in this assessment. The WTO litigation and the procurement have nothing to do with each other.  On the United States Government Accountability Office reactions, we would like to say that the US Air Forces selection of the Northrop Grumman KC 45  remains in force. There is a misperception that Northrop Grumman and the EADS North America have somehow lost or that the Boeing award has been reversed. Northrop Grumman and EADS North America remain under contract, albeit under a stopwork order, which places on hold the work under contract.  The US Government Accountability Office reviewed the Air Forces evaluation process, not the capabilities of the aircraft. There is no requirement or direction from the Accountability Office to recompete the previous contract award. The Air Force and Department of Defense have indicated that the KC 45  best meets the USAFs requirements. The Accountability Office has requested the Air Force to respond regarding the steps it will take within  60  days of the  18  June announcement.  In general, the government support for aerospace meets the need that certain developments in the large civil aircraft industry require very high levels of investment. It is the Commissions view that any government support for aerospace on both sides of the Atlantic has to be balanced, in order to ensure that the conditions of competition are not distorted. If this is the case, such support can contribute to innovation, increase safety and improve environmental performance and efficiencies in air transportation. It is in the interests of airlines and consumers, as well as governments, to maintain a high level of healthy competition in the aircraft sector.  On the prospects of the bilateral agreements of  1992 , we would like to inform you that, despite several goodfaith attempts to solve the dispute amicably over the past years, the differences between the two sides  the US and the EU  have proven too big. The US has denied there are any subsidies to Boeing while at the same time demanding that the EU put an end to European support to Airbus. On this basis it has not been possible to establish a fair and balanced basis for a negotiated settlement yet.  On  18  October  2007  Boeing publicly rejected Airbuss offer to explore an amicable solution. We should also be aware that, with the current preelectoral atmosphere in the US, it may not be easy at the present time to find a balanced settlement. We therefore do not expect that this dispute can be resolved in the near future, before the WTO has ruled on both the Airbus and Boeing cases.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the honourable Member of the European Parliament for his interest in and support for this cause, as demonstrated in the oral question and resolution provided to us.
786510 author: Sebastian Bauer:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for the interesting comments and the debate that we have had. I would like to pick up on a couple of points that have been raised.  First of all you are correct to point out that there are fewer fishing opportunities under this revised protocol. This was precisely the reason behind our decision to effect a renegotiation, because we needed to ensure maximum utilisation of the fishing opportunities, whereas under the previous situation there was significant underutilisation of the fishing possibilities both with regard to small pelagics and with regard to cephalopods.  On the issue of technical requirements, for example with regard to dredges, we hope that we will find a solution quickly to this issue, and the Mauritanian authorities are very well disposed to finding a solution to the satisfaction of both sides. Regarding rest periods, this request came originally from the industry since they maintain that, after such rest periods, catches become more profitable.  On the question of setting the minimum size for octopus at  500  g, I need to make the point that we are dealing with a third country, a sovereign nation, Mauritania, and its own regulation specifies that the minimum size for octopus is  500  g. This was a line we could not cross during negotiations: one cannot ask a third country to change its legislation because it is interesting to our own fishermen to catch smallersized cephalopods. However, we do recognise that there is not one harmonised regulation on the subject in the region. There are other countries which allow catches of cephalopods of smaller size, and therefore a decision on this matter should be taken within the COPACE organisation.  On the issue of allocation keys, i.e. what is known as relative stability, as I said before the Commission is not bound to transfer relative stability from one agreement to another or from one protocol to another.  However, it is provided for in the agreement and in the protocol that, should Member States need more opportunities, and should such requests be based on science, on the state of the stock, then such requests could certainly be considered, and I would undertake to take them up with Mauritania in order to negotiate increases, as in the case for example of cephalopods, if there is a specific request to do so.  I need to make the point that with regard to cephalopods licences were utilised on  22  occasions and in the new protocol there is provision for  25 , so we are actually catering for creating a buffer, allowing for utilisation.  If the particular Member State involved maintains that they have requests in excess of  25 , as long as they give us the specific facts, we will take those up with Mauritania in order to bring about an increase, always as long as the state of the stock allows. I need to underline the fact that with regard to cephalopods we do have problems concerning the sustainability and the health of the stock.  Again on the question of this whole issue of relative stability, I would also like to point out that one cannot have ones cake and eat it. On one hand, when it comes to the allocation of cephalopods, the allocation seems not to please one particular Member State. But then when it comes to tuna where there is a significant increase of allocations for that same Member State, then that works out in the Member States favour and we have received no complaints in that regard.  Concerning the reason for the denunciation and the renegotiation of the protocol, namely that it was underutilised, again I would like to make the point made by Mrs Isler Bguin that such agreements are not only about fisheries but also about development assistance. In fact, whereas we have decreased the financial component for fishing opportunities, there is a clear undertaking on our part to increase the development component, and we are fully committed to respect this.  Therefore, in total, the financial allocation has been maintained over the fouryear term. The budgetary support to the  10 th EDF will compensate for the remaining EUR  40  million for  2009102012  at the rate of EUR  10  million per year and this means that Mauritania will be receiving a financial package which, when you take into account both what they are receiving by way of compensation for fishing opportunities  which have been reduced on the basis of what was actually being fished in Mauritanian waters  and the increase to the budgetary support through the  10 th EDF ad hoc compensation within this protocol, we end up with a situation where the total package is equivalent to the fishing package that they had under the previous financial protocol.  Finally on the issue of boarding I would like to say that a meeting of the working group will be held this Sunday, this weekend, in order to discuss this specific issue and to agree on recommendations and guidelines that should solve the issue. On the point made by Mrs Fraga at the very outset concerning participation of MEPs, the Commission considers that the same approach that is followed for the participation of MEPs in bilateral negotiations has to be followed as regards joint committees where the two parties are officially represented.  The Commission will, however, continue to cooperate with Parliament on the basis of the framework agreement that exists.
3201802 author: Sarah Green:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, firstly I am very grateful to the European Parliament for arranging this debate at such short notice.  As you are aware, yesterday the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation containing key elements of the EU package of emergency measures to address the fuel crisis. Today I am seeking your agreement to this proposal.  Unfortunately it was impossible for the Commission to adopt its proposal on  3  July as had initially been planned. The reason for that is the depth of the analysis that had to go into the proposal, to guarantee that it is a really effective instrument to address the severe problems the sector is facing.  The Committee on Fisheries held a useful discussion this morning, for which I am thankful. A number of questions could be clarified and debated and I hope to be able to take the important and useful suggestions into consideration during negotiations in the Council next week. I am looking forward to more debate with you, now hoping that this can pave the way to your favourable opinion on our proposal in the vote tomorrow.  As I explained to you only three weeks ago, the fisheries sector is facing a crisis which is structural and long lasting. For many years, the EU fleet has suffered from a vicious circle of overcapacity, overfishing and declining profitability. At the same time, fishers have been unable to benefit from reduced supply and rising retail prices for fish products. As a result, profits are decreasing, making the sector more vulnerable than others to a drastic rise in costs, such as we have seen with the price of oil.  The Commission understands the need for coordinated action at EU level to avert a severe crisis for the industry and to ensure that the problem is really tackled head on. This means not only providing the possibility of emergency relief but committing to finally addressing the underlying issue of overcapacity, which is undermining all our attempts to get the industry back on a sustainable and profitable footing.  For these reasons, the Commission has proposed an emergency package of measures to tackle the immediate social and economic hardship triggered by the dramatic rise in the price of oil, while also tackling the underlying structural problems of the European fleet. I believe that it is vital to focus aid on the fleets which are most dependent on fuel and thus most affected by the current overcapacity.  We therefore propose that Member States can immediately grant temporary cessation aid as a leadin measure to restructuring and that they can then set up Fleet Adaptation Schemes under which limitations on access to permanent cessation  scrapping  premiums will be lifted. Additional aid for temporary cessation, as well as modernisation and energy efficiency, would be available for vessels involved in such schemes. Partial decommissioning aid would be granted to operators who replace larger old vessels with smaller, more energyefficient ones.  Based on further economic analyses, possible modifications to the de minimis regime for fisheries may also be considered. We will, furthermore, propose provisions to allow for temporary reductions in employees contributions to social security payments.  A number of specific initiatives to promote the value of fish at the first point of sale are also envisaged. The Commission is planning to assist ad hoc projects in this area, in addition to the funds available under the European Fisheries Fund. Further measures are planned to encourage the shift to energysaving technologies, cushion the socioeconomic impact of the crisis, and facilitate the reprogramming and the disbursement of EFF funds.  The above measures will consist of temporary derogations to the rules of the European Fisheries Fund so as to support faster adaptation of the EU fleet to the present situation and provide temporary relief during the transitional phase.  I believe that these measures will help give an essential thrust to the industry to structurally adapt, whilst easing the transition for fishermen, vessel owners and people employed in support services during the period of adaptation. The Commission has engaged in very important and constructive discussion with the industry on this matter and the industry gives general support to our initiatives.  With regard to the official amendments that have been tabled by Parliament to the Commission proposal, we can accept the amendment referring to Recital  13  and, in fact, it should be applied to all vessels. However, the Commission cannot support the amendment to Article  18 ( 2 ) as this would make the partial decommissioning measure virtually impossible to apply in practice.  Finally, and very importantly, let me express my belief that throughout this process we can give further impetus to the common fisheries policy, in particular in the context of resource sustainability.  I am aware of the very short deadline and that this leaves the European Parliament with little time to react. However, given the exceptional situation being faced by the fisheries sector, I trust I can count on the support of Parliament to adopt the said measures as speedily as possible.
8717354 author: Christoph Green:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I want to thank Mr Parish for raising this question, because it is a question to which the Commission has given a lot of consideration and considers important, and it is indeed something which preoccupies us. The European Commission  as Mr Parish said  has asked EFSA to provide an opinion on food safety, animal health, animal welfare and the environmental implications of the use of live animal clones.  The final opinion was adopted on  15  July this year, and the Commission is now evaluating the necessary steps to be taken. This opinion refers to uncertainties in the risk assessment due to the limited number of studies available. It also refers to the fact that the health and welfare of a significant proportion of clones have been found to be adversely affected, often severely, with a fatal outcome.  The Commission is aware that, even though the efficiency of animal cloning has improved in recent years, adverse health affects on animal health and welfare still occur today. There are indications that mortality and morbidity rates in clones after birth are higher than in sexuallyreproduced animals. However, most surviving clones are normal and healthy, as determined by psychological measurements as well as by behaviour and clinical examinations.  The Commission closely follows the scientific developments in this area. In  2004  the Commission also financed a panEuropean research project called Cloning in Public, addressing ethical, legal and other societal aspects of farm animal cloning. The project was coordinated by the Danish Centre for Bioethics and Risk Assessment and aimed to promote public debate on the issue of biotechnology.  As far as the involvement of the public is concerned, in autumn  2007  the Commission launched a public consultation on the ethics of animal cloning for food supply, and in September  2007  it organised an open round table on the same topic with representatives from academia, industry, NGOs, civil society, international organisations, industry etc. In order to increase public participation, the round table was also broadcast on the internet, and its proceedings have been published.  Last but not least, the Commission has recently launched a Eurobarometer survey on consumers attitudes to cloning for food production. Its purpose is to ask the public about their opinion and their awareness regarding cloning and food derived from the offspring of cloned animals. The results will be made available very shortly.  The Commission takes ethical considerations fully into account when dealing with sensitive issues such as cloning. The Commission has given its attention to the ethics of animal cloning since  1997 , when the group of advisers to the European Commission on the ethical implications of biotechnology issued an opinion on the ethics of cloning. Due to the state of the art of technology at that time, the opinion did not address the use of cloning for food purposes. It is for this reason that the Commission asked the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, the independent advisory body to the Commission in this field, to give an opinion on the ethical aspects of animal cloning for food supply. Their opinion was published in January this year. Considering the current level of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and animal clones, the European Group on Ethics expressed doubts as to whether cloning animals for food supply is ethically justified. It advocated that at the moment there are no convincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their offspring. The Commission is currently examining the concerns expressed by the Group.  Under international rules, restrictions to imports of products must be based on legitimate concerns, not be discriminatory, and be proportionate to the objective pursued. According to global trade rules, imports of food products from third countries might be suspended if they present a serious threat to animal or public health. On the basis of the studies conducted and the opinion of EFSA, the Commission will consider whether restrictions must be imposed. I am sure this will be done very shortly.
6145210 author: Roger Finlayson:  rapporteur.  Mr President, firstly I would like to pay tribute to the shadow rapporteurs and their group advisers for their useful input on this report. I think we had some very interesting debates and we did not always agree. But at least we managed to conduct the discussions in a very civilised manner.  I would also like to thank the International Trade Committee secretariat for their input and, while I am on my thankyous, I would like to thank all the DG Trade officials for their useful advice and suggestions.  Clearly the European Union, as the largest exporter of services, has a strong interest in opening new markets for services. However, my personal interest in this subject is more focused on how services can be used as a tool to help the poorest people out of poverty.  But before we do that, let us remind ourselves of the importance of services. Services represent  75  or thereabouts (there is some debatedisputes over the exact numbers) of the EUs GDP compared to only about  2  for agriculture. In Africa, services represent  52  of GDP and rising compared to  16  for agriculture. So, given these figures, it is a real shame that so much emphasis was placed on agriculture in the DOHA development round when it is really the opening of trade and services that promises to take so many people out of poverty. That is why I was prepared to accept amendments stating that negotiations on trade and services would not only serve the interests of the EU, but the economic growth of the poorest countries.  We should not forget what development actually means: it is taking people out of poverty, and we can achieve this by encouraging entrepreneurs to create wealth and jobs.  In many of the poorest countries, entrepreneurs tell me that they are desperate to tackle poverty. But what they really need are banking services for getting that cheaper loan to be able to expand their business and employ more people and create more wealth locally; insurance services, making sure that when their life or their business is ruined and something goes wrong, they have something to fall back on; legal services, enforcing those contracts made with partners; and communications services, knowing the best prices at local markets, deciding when to go to local markets and actually get into local markets.  However, we should all recognise that where governments through no fault of their own are unable to provide basic services such as health, education and water to the poorest citizens, then entrepreneurs must have a role to fill in the gaps in service provision.  Unfortunately, trade in services only accounts for about  25  of world trade but has a potential to create so much more wealth and jobs. But let us turn to some of the contentious points in the report.  One of the points of debate has been over the socalled services of general economic interest, but we should remember that different countries define these in different ways. Some countries believe that health, education and water should only be provided by the state. Others have turned to nonstate players. In Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda, more than  40  of people in the lowest economic quintile receive their health care from private providers. Surely we should be encouraging more investment in these sectors.  In education, I urge my colleagues to look at the work of Professor James Tooley of Newcastle University. He began his research at the Londonbased Institute of Education with the belief that private education was actually an abomination. However, he soon found out, perhaps counterintuitively, that private schools could provide a better education to the poor. When a survey was conducted of state schools in India, some were simply shut. In some, teachers did not turn up and in one case a teacher made his students make tea for him all day long. So the working poor voted with their feet. They saved up to pay for private education, not in a steel and glass tower, but usually a simple room above a shop. These schools then subsidised free education for the nonworking poor.  What is wrong, I ask, with encouraging trade in these services when it helps the poorest? Now I hear some Members of this House who believe that only the state can provide these services and it should be on a monopoly basis. And even where there is state failure or where the state collects insufficient revenue to provide these services, they do not believe that nonstate players should be allowed to fill in the gap. Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to water? Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to education? Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to health care, rather than go to a private provider?  The next point of contention has been over sovereignty. Now, I agree with those who say that we should not force the opening of trade and services down the throat of our negotiating partners. But surely we should agree that where a country decides to liberalise what we may consider to be a service of general economic interest, we have no right to tell them not to liberalise their markets.  I have to say, though, I have been disappointed by some of my colleagues: some Members of this House believe that we should actually tell developing countries to close their markets. It should not be about private versus state. It should not be about local versus foreign providers. It should be about what works. Instead I believe we should all work together to bring down trade barriers that condemn the poor.  We should work together to end state monopolies that leave many of the poorest without essential services and we should be always be a friend to those entrepreneurs who want to tackle global poverty by creating wealth and jobs through increased investment in services.
10441328 author: Christoph Brown:  President of the European Court of Auditors.  Mr President, it is an honour for me to be able to take part in your debate on the Court of Auditors annual report on the  2007  financial year, which I have already presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control on  10  November.  Overall, the Courts audit opinion on the accounts is now unqualified  positive, if you wish  but the opinion on underlying transactions is broadly similar to that of last year.  On the accounts, the Court concludes that they give a fair presentation, in all material respects, of the financial position of the European Communities and cash flows at the year end. Owing to the improvements that have taken place, the qualifications expressed last year are no longer necessary.  As regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, the Court gives unqualified opinions for revenue, commitments and payments for economic and financial affairs and administrative and other expenditure.  As regards administrative and other expenditure, which accounts for EUR  8  billion in  2007 , the Court acknowledges the decisions and actions taken by the institutions to further improve financial management based on the recommendations made by the Court, including those taken by the European Parliament. The Court will assess their impact in future years.  However, for agriculture and natural resources, cohesion, research, energy and transport, external aid, development and enlargement, and education and citizenship the Court concludes that payments are still materially affected by errors, although to different degrees. Supervisory and control systems covering these areas are judged to be at best only partially effective, although in research and, at the level of the Commission, for external aid, development and enlargement, the Court notes certain improvements in the supervisory and control systems.  For cohesion which accounted for EUR  42  billion of budgetary expenditure, the Court estimates, based on the audit of a representative sample of transactions, that at least  11  of the costs claimed should not have been reimbursed. The most common reasons for errors were ineligible costs, overdeclarations of money spent and serious failures to respect procurement rules.  For agriculture and natural resources, where EUR  51  billion was spent in  2007 , the Court found that rural development continues to account for a disproportionately large part of the overall error, while the error rate for EAGF expenditure is estimated to be slightly below the materiality threshold.  But why is this situation persisting, and why are the underlying transactions in a situation broadly similar to that of last year? Well, material levels of errors persist because there is a high level of inherent risk associated with many areas of European Union spending and weaknesses related to supervision and control.  Much of the budget, including in the areas under shared management, is disbursed to millions of beneficiaries across the Union, often under complex rules and regulations, based on the selfdeclarations of those who receive the funds. These inherently risky circumstances lead to errors by them and also by those paying the funds.  To control these risks, there are several levels of supervision and control: first, at the level of beneficiaries; second, to ensure that the arrangements to check claims are designed and operating effectively, and, finally, supervision by the Commission to ensure that all the systems are working as a whole.  As most errors occur at the level of the final beneficiaries, they can often only be detected reliably by detailed controls carried out on the spot. Such checking is costly, and so, usually, only a small proportion of individual claims are covered.  Again, the Courts audit work on the  2007  financial year found that Member States are not always effective in identifying the shortcomings in the arrangements for checking individual claims. The Court also found some weaknesses in the Commissions conformity clearance in agriculture.  In many areas of the budget, mechanisms exist for recovering incorrectly made payments from beneficiaries or, where Member States have incorrectly administered expenditure schemes, disallowing some expenditure, i.e. refusing to finance it from the budget.  However, there is not yet reliable information on the impact of corrective actions, and the Court concluded that corrective actions cannot yet be considered effective in mitigating errors.  All of this said, it is fair to acknowledge that the Commission has made significant efforts since  2000  to address the weaknesses in supervision and control, mainly through developing and implementing an internal reform programme and, in  2006 , launching an action plan to improve the supervisory and control systems across the Union.  Annual activity reports and declarations, a key part of the reform programme, including those relating to cohesion and agriculture, now present a picture that is more in line with the Courts own assessments, but some reservations still appear to underestimate the problems.  Concerning its  2006  action plan, in spite of progress noted by the Commission, the Court finds that it is still too early for their impact on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions to be felt. For example,  2007  was only the first year for which Member States were required to produce an annual summary of available audits and declarations. These can, in time, as outlined in the Courts Opinion  62007 , stimulate improved management and control of European Union funds. But they do not yet provide a reliable assessment of the functioning and effectiveness of the systems.  This is the current situation. But, looking forward, we need to ask what more should be done, and which measures for the future should be considered. The Court suggests that any such measures need to take the following considerations into account.  First, the benefits from efforts to reduce errors need to be weighed against the costs.  Second, all participants in the budget process need to recognise that some risk of error is unavoidable.  Third, the appropriate level of risk for the different individual areas of the budget needs to be agreed on at the political level by the budgetdischarge authorities in the name of the citizens.  Fourth, schemes that cannot be satisfactorily implemented at an acceptable level of cost and with tolerable risk should be reconsidered.  Finally, due consideration needs to be given to simplification, not least in areas such as rural development and research, because welldesigned rules and regulations that are clear to interpret and simple to apply decrease the risk of error and enable streamlined, costeffect management and control arrangements.  The Court, therefore, encourages the Commission to conclude its analysis on the cost of controls, and on the levels of risk inherent in the different spending areas. The Court also recommends the Commission continue in its efforts to improve its monitoring and reporting, including working with Member States so that effective use of the annual summaries can be made in the annual activity reports, and allowing its followup of actions to improve recovery systems.  In addition to simplification and making use of the concept of tolerable risk, in its response to the Commission communication Reforming the Budget, Changing Europe, the Court suggests applying the principles of clarity of objectives, realism, transparency and accountability when designing arrangements for European Union spending. The Court also encourages the political authorities to explore the scope for recasting expenditure programmes in term of outputs and to critically consider the appropriate level of national, regional and local discretion in managing them.  To conclude, while acknowledging that progress is being made, the Court underlines that further improvements in the financial management of the European Union will depend on the success of ongoing and future measures to reduce risks to an acceptable level and develop costeffective systems to manage them.  In times of financial turbulence and economic instability, the role of the Court is even more important and relevant. As the external auditor of the European Union, it is our obligation to act as the independent guardian of the financial interests of the citizens of the Union. In presenting this report, it is our objective to contribute towards transparency and promote accountability, both of which are considered essential to securing the trust of European Union citizens in its institutions that keep the Union functioning and give it the direction for the future.
759801 author: Nancy Cameron:  wife of Hu Jia.  Dear friends, I am Hu Jias wife, Zeng Jinyan. Hu Jia is currently in prison and so is unable to come to the ceremony to receive his Sakharov Prize.  I do not have a passport so I cannot come to Europe either to attend the ceremony for the Sakharov Prizes  20 th anniversary. We are deeply sorry about this.  The good news is that Hu Jia was transferred on  10  October  2008  from Chaobai prison in Tianjin to the Beijing municipal prison, and that the conditions in which he is being held have improved. As for his health, he is looking a little better. He seems to be in slightly better shape than he was in Chaobai prison.  However, he had two blood tests in the space of a month and we do not know what the results were. Although we asked for them, the results of the tests have not been given to the family. This behaviour worries us. It makes us fear that his cirrhosis has got worse.  I visited Hu Jia in the Beijing municipal prison on  21  November  2008 . Before our meeting, we were both warned separately by the prison authorities that we were forbidden to talk about the fact that he had been awarded the Sakharov Prize.  So, during my visit, neither of us was able to talk about the prize. We were not able to discuss it by letter either, as all our correspondence is inspected. Even if all we do is express a view about social phenomena or if Hu Jia talks about the prison, when the prison authorities are not happy with it, our letters are confiscated or Hu Jias letters are returned to him. We very much hope to be able to communicate more normally, but for the time being, it is very hard.  At the end of October  2008  or beginning of November, I am not exactly sure which, State Security police officers told Hu Jia he had won the Sakharov Prize.  And when I saw him on  21  November, I could sense that he was very happy about it. I know that Hu Jia spoke to his mother and to the policemen about it. These are more or less his words:  Perhaps the European Parliament was thinking of the work I did in the areas of AIDS and the environment, because what I did in terms of human rights was very far from sufficient and I will need to redouble my efforts.  He also said this Sakharov Prize was very important for China and he was confident that the future would prove him right. Obviously, from my personal viewpoint, I hope he comes home as soon as possible. Hu Jia said one day that he hoped to be Chinas last prisoner of conscience but the reality is very different. Since the day of his trial, on  3  April, there have been others such as Huang Qi, Zeng Honglin and Chen Daojun who have been arrested by the authorities because they expressed their views publicly. And some of them have been tried and given prison sentences.  This shows that the situation of freedom of opinion is still absolutely appalling and that there is no reason for optimism.  Even in these circumstances, however, there are now a great many exceptional people and people of goodwill in Chinese society who are going to great lengths to find ways to make the real situation in China known, and to express deeplyfelt views, and the internet is providing them with a very interesting platform. But unfortunately, there is sometimes a very high price to be paid for this.  If the truth be told, sometimes ones courage is not enough. Sometimes the price to be paid is very, very high. There have been cases in which, after human rights activists, writers and others have used their freedom of thought, their relatives have also been harassed by the police, have lost their jobs or have been put under house arrest. And more serious still, some have even been tried and convicted.  Hu Jia had himself been illegally kidnapped several times by the police since  2004 , without any form of legal procedure. He was constantly followed and, in the end, he was given a prison sentence. And I, who am his wife, I am often harassed by the police.  Others are in the same situation, such as Chen Guangchen and his wife, Guo Feixiong and his wife, and even their child, who has been denied his right to education. Thanks to many appeals from different quarters, Guo Feixiongs children were later able to go back to school although in circumstances that are not very satisfactory.  For all these reasons, I would like to respect the desire that Hu Jia has expressed on many occasions. He has often said he would like to set up a support network to help the families of human rights activists. To provide moral support for the families, to ease their mental and life pressure to which they are subjected. So that they can be strong enough to face the pressure of the authorities in a more active and optimistic manner, and to discourage cruel revengetaking on families.  I cannot at the moment do very much but I would like to use the EUR  50   000  of Hu Jias Sakharov Prize as startup money, to establish a foundation to support the families of human rights activists and to finally realise what Hu Jia had always wanted.  Why is the human rights work done by Hu Jia so difficult?  I think this is mainly because Chinas legal system is not satisfactory. There are laws, there are all sorts of articles and regulations, some are well written, but they are not applied.  In reality, the situation of the rule of law is disastrous. The judicial system has no independence. Until  2004 , Hu Jia devoted most of his activity to the problems of AIDS and the environment. He spent a lot of the time in the field, on campaigns, where people needed him to take concrete action.  Then, from  2004  onwards, the police regularly denied him his freedom of movement and he had no other choice but to participate in human rights movements from his home, writing articles and publishing reports from the field.  I think that during all these years, the most important and most interesting thing he did was to have constantly persisted in saying the truth. He never stopped writing about the phenomena he observed. He never stopped describing, one by one, all the realities that the Chinese media cannot say. He never stopped publishing all this on websites so that the public could learn about the reality of China and understand it.  In my view, this has been his greatest contribution.  If you look at China now, you see everyone talking, but lying is very widespread. Nonetheless, there are people who continue their quest for the truth. Because the school textbooks our children study, our newspapers and broadcast media, our libraries and all these documents and files, they all resemble what you find in the novel Nineteen EightyFour. They are written in another language to describe a fictitious reality.  What is the real situation, the real China? We do not know.  That is why there is a group of thinking people, like Hu Jia, in China who have never abandoned their quest for the truth. But Hu Jia has paid a very heavy price.  Our child is now just one year old. This is a key period in her life but Hu Jia is not able to be at her side. It is very difficult for me to talk about this, but I think...  And then Hu Jia has also always been very optimistic. He said he thought China was experiencing the most open period of its history, that you had to seize the opportunity to more effectively promote a fairer, freer and more democratic society in China.  We can indeed see this in our daily life, although the Government still has very tight control over the media and over freedom of association, and perhaps even tighter control with the use of new technology. On the other hand, however, civil society also uses the new technology and the platform that the internet provides to actively promote a fairer judicial system and a more just society, and to investigate and expose the real China.  And to carry out citizen education, to educate citizens about human rights. It is a real hope: whether the Government wants it or not, and whether leading figures inside or outside China recognise it or not, China is moving at great speed towards an open and democratic society.  I would finally like to say that, whatever happens, we must maintain an active and optimistic attitude and pursue our efforts to promote the rule of law in China, to promote democracy and freedom in China.  We are full of hope of soon being able to hail the arrival of an open China. We are full of energy for China to become a country at peace.  I would like to thank our European Parliament friends from the bottom of my heart. The European Parliament has, from the outset, taken an interest in Hu Jias case and has deployed considerable efforts on behalf of freedom for Hu Jia and other Chinese human rights activists, efforts that demand respect.  It has also never stopped drawing attention to the need for freedom to become a reality for the people of China. Thank you; thank you very much.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all those friends whom I have never seen. If you had not supported us for so long, if you had not taken an interest in our fate, if you had not constantly encouraged us, I think we would never have found the courage to confront such a difficult social reality.  It helps us to keep hope and to continue our efforts.  I thank you. Thank you for all the efforts you have undertaken for Hu Jia, for me and for our family. Thank you for your efforts on behalf of human rights activists and your contribution to the progress of Chinese society.  Thank you.  (The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation.)
5359434 author: Helen Corless:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, let me first say that I understand that our colleague, Rama Yade, has experienced difficulty getting here. Yesterday, I myself had to wait five hours for my flight to Strasbourg. Maybe she is having the same difficulties, so bear with her  this is force majeure, after all.  (Interjection from the floor: Travelling circus!)  Well, five hours is not normal. I am just saying that I do not know exactly what has happened to her, but that was what happened to me, and I was very glad that I did not have an appointment yesterday, because the same thing could have happened to me too. I just wanted to express my solidarity on this point.  Second, this human rights dialogue and the report on human rights constitute one of our basic major concerns. I would just like to show you the new EU report. When I started as Commissioner, we had separate reports from the Council and the Commission and now I am very happy to show you that the Council and the Commission have drawn up this report together. The foreword is by Bernard Kouchner, Javier Solana and myself. I think it is very important to show that here we are really working together.  As I said in my introductory remarks, we are trying very hard to go forward on the path of promoting human rights. However, we also know that the glass can be half full or half empty. A lot remains to be done, and it was very moving to see so many defenders of human rights here this morning. I spoke of Elena Bonner, but I could have spoken of any of them, and of course the video of Hu Jias wife was very moving: she has shown great courage.  I would like to reply to some of the questions. I cannot answer every question on behalf of the Commission, but I shall go into as much detail as I can.  First, concerning the death penalty, let me say that I have taken up this issue very forcefully. I am totally against the death penalty, and throughout this year we have given massive support in the UN for the resolution on a moratorium in more countries. But, yes, the problem is still there: many executions are still being carried out by a small number  Iran on the one hand, unfortunately China, and there are many others. We have to go on fighting against that by raising it in every dialogue. It is most important that we do that: every person who is executed is one too many.  Let me say in this context that we were all working against the execution of Wo Weihan. Sadly, he was executed on the very day of the EU human rights dialogue with China. This was a terrible example of not listening to each other.  Second, let me say to Mr Agnoletto that human rights clauses are indeed very important. At this very moment, Member States and the Commission are currently undertaking a wideranging review of the EUs policy on standard political clauses in external agreements in general, in order to strike the right balance between key, untouchable principles of the European Union on the one hand and, on the other, the need for a certain flexibility to negotiate on various parts, because we need to try and reach agreement.  This review is ongoing. It would be a little premature for me to comment on the outcome at this stage because we are not yet at an end result, but the use of the human rights clause is one issue that is being carefully considered. But political clauses in all political agreements, and in trade and sectoral agreements of different kinds, are there and they have to be there.  My next point concerns the Human Rights Council. Mrs Andrikien, I agree that there could be many improvements and, therefore, we will have to insist on having special rapporteurs and perhaps also country resolutions; I think this could help. I also find it very positive that all countries are scrutinised every four years and that there is also involvement by civil society. I must say that, up to now, we have seen that countries have been quite seriously prepared. That is something positive, and the discussion in depth is there and should continue. We all know that things are not perfect, but we can go on and make further improvements.  Let me say a word on China and human rights. I am always, as Commissioner responsible for relations with China among other countries, very open to building a strong relationship with China based on mutual respect. However, I also have to tell you that I am concerned by what I perceive as a certain toughening of the Chinese position on human rights, as seen by the execution of Wo Weihan on the day of the human rights dialogue.  This has been confirmed by what we have heard today and in recent days, such as the suppression of demonstrations in Beijing on the  60 th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  there was a presidency statement concerning that; the blocking of foreign websites  for instance, the BBC website; and a very negative report by the United Nations Committee on Torture three weeks ago.  However, I would also like to take up the words of Zeng Jinyan, Hu Jias wife, this morning, who said that China is moving in great steps towards an open and democratic society. I think this movement is going on. There are many other things, much has been done for instance over recent years by China, for example, on labour rights. It is important that there has been some progress, but many other problems persist, particularly concerning implementation. Sometimes, even when things are written, as we have heard today, many of them still have to be implemented.  I therefore reiterate that we stand ready, for instance, to provide expertise on further legislative reforms. As President Pttering said, China is a great country. We have many common interests and need to work together, but I think that we, the European Union, should not take hasty decisions. We have to reflect on the recent negative signals sent by China on human rights that are damaging our mutual trust. I think that it is now for China to send some positive signals to rebuild this trust.  As regards Guantnamo, we have called repeatedly in the many debates held here, in which I also participated, for the closure of Guantnamo. Naturally, we also welcome Presidentelect Barack Obamas statement that he will take steps to close the detention centre quickly.  We are willing to work with the US Administration to find ways to deal with the practical issues which will arise when Guantnamo is closed, such as the resettlement of prisoners in third countries. For instance, the European Union has recently expressed its concerns regarding secret detention, and we hope that the Presidentelect will then address this issue and Member States will be able to answer. I cannot speak for the Member States as such.  On the situation in the Middle East, particularly in Gaza, I very much regret the return to violence in recent days; the five months of calm achieved by the truce were unfortunately too short, but they were very welcome. It has been very difficult to watch the return of violence. We have condemned the recent rocket attacks from Gaza but we have, at the same time, condemned the closing of the crossings.  I myself asked the Israeli Ambassador to come to my office. I clearly expressed my concerns about the question in Gaza. We could not give the fuel that we normally fund, we could not enable UNRWA to do what they are normally doing. The day before yesterday I was in New York, and we spoke with Ban Kimoon, the UN SecretaryGeneral, on that subject. President of the Council Kouchner and I wrote a letter to the Israeli authorities in order to get funding going. We are very much monitoring the situation. Unfortunately, it is not at all easy, and in all our dialogues and consultations, we always mention these things.  I would now like to say something on the coherence that has been mentioned between external and internal policies. Yes, I think it is true. This is a point that we have to take. This has been taken up with Jacques Barrot. He has tried to go forward on the question of migration in a way which pays much more attention to human rights. I think this builds up our credibility, but a lot is also within Member States competence which means it is not that easy.  I greet State Secretary, Mrs Rama Yade.  I can only say that human rights dialogues are reciprocal: that means we also tackle human rights issues in the European Union, and we have JLS experts within the different Member States.  There is also a UN Commissioner for human rights envisaging creating an office in Brussels, so we are trying to enhance the coherence between internal and external policies.  I shall stop here. I am sorry I cannot say anything on colonisation. That is a matter for the Member States. You know it very well.  (Interjection by Marios Matsakis)  I am sorry, but it is not within the competence of the Commission to enter into this question.
5888886 author: Philip White:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I would also like to start by expressing gratitude and feelings similar to those stated by Jan Andersson in his introductory comments on the importance of the EQARF recommendation with regard to the very excellent work and cooperation between the institutions. The committees and the Commission hope to come to very close firstreading agreement on two important instruments.  Firstly, I would like to show my appreciation of the work of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I would also like to mention the contribution made by Ramona Mnescu and the Committee on Culture and Education and, on the second item  because we linked together two items  that of the same committees: Culture and Education, and Employment. I should also like to mention Dumitru Oprea for the contribution of many interesting points which both Jan Andersson and Thomas Mann have already highlighted.  People and Member States have spoken a great deal about the Bologna Process but now more and more is being said about the importance of skills, vocational education and training and the Copenhagen Process. This year we had the first EuroSkills competition, which will help to increase popularity, attractiveness, quality and exchange of best practices in the very important area of VET. I would like to make some remarks on the importance of the two instruments which will be voted on in this plenary tomorrow through your reports.  On the EQARF recommendation: vocational education and training were overshadowed by reform processes in Europe, but if we really want to make our Union more competitive and socially cohesive, as outlined in the Lisbon Strategy, it must be about the importance and quality of both general education and vocational education. The rather technical nature of the first recommendation should not detract from the importance of this instrument. Quality assurance underpins every VET policy initiative. It helps to build mutual trust and to modernise VET systems by improving the effectiveness of training.  The Quality Assurance Framework is designed to continuously improve vocational education and training. It is based on a quality cycle which establishes links between the four phases: planning, implementation, evaluation and review. It includes ways in which the performance of VET can be monitored and it measures the improvement of VET at both system and provider levels. The approach to quality assurance is reflected in the general principles contained in the Annex to the  2007  recommendation on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework, so it is already part of the established EQARF.  Quality, the learning outcomes approach and the qualifications framework go hand in hand. We need these instruments in one mosaic. Quality assurance is a precondition for trust between the systems and countries in order to transfer learning outcomes as results. I think the compromises achieved in the process are very important. The Commission supports the text as proposed. Your contributions improve the text; for example, the new deadline set for designing a national approach, an explicit reference to the involvement of local and regional authorities. In explaining the socalled toolbox nature of the framework, your contribution also helped to clarify the meaning of the original text.  On the other instrument, I would just like to say that it is also necessary if we really want to promote lifelong learning and to facilitate real mobility. As I like to say, we are citizens, not tourists, in one European Union. We need this mobility for both learners and for workers so that people can take advantage of the richness offered by different European education and training systems at national or even regional levels. This is only possible if individuals learning achievements are adequately appreciated when passing from one learning context to another.  This is to be opened much more now by ECVET, the European credit transfer system for VET. The objective of ECVET is twofold: firstly, to support and promote transnational mobility and, secondly, to give access to lifelong learning to respond to the real needs of individuals, the labour market and our societies.  I do not want to say any more, but I will just assure you that this instrument is and will be compatible with the other one, the European credit system for general higher education (ECTS), and with the various qualification systems which already exist in Europe. It will be implemented according to the rules and legal instruments of each participating country.  Mr Mann stressed the voluntary participation of the Member States. This indicates the diversity of our systems, but also maturity in finding common instruments as a result of our work together and willingness to create conditions for compatibility and transferability between different systems. During this process, we could see how a bottomup approach helped to analyse and form the instruments in both cases.  In this connection, I would also like to say that the compromise achieved is acceptable and very important, not only for the conclusion but also for the satisfaction of all sensitivities or concerns. I think it even improves the text. Specifically, I appreciate the contribution on a stronger role for national and regional authorities and also on highlighting the importance of a testing period or results during the process of implementation. So the Commission supports the proposals and compromise achieved.
934175 author: Jennifer Reid:  High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  Mr President, this is the first time that I have appeared before you this year,  2009 . It is a great pleasure to be here and I hope that the good cooperation we have had in the past will continue this year.  The war in Gaza ended a month ago, on  18  January, and I think you would agree with me that it feels like yesterday. The scale of the suffering and destruction was immense and it has left us all with a bitter taste in our mouths. The humanitarian situation today remains heartbreaking. We need to find urgent solutions to get aid in and to reduce the level of suffering of the people.  At the same time, we need to do all we can to end the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians and between Israel and the Arab world. In fact, the parameters of the solution are well known, and have been known for some time. What matters now is the political will to implement it among Israelis and Palestinians, among Arabs and the wider international community.  The European vocation for peace in the Middle East remains as strong as ever. Our commitment to the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state, living side by side with Israel, is total. It is at the heart of our Middle East policy. All our actions have this strategic objective in mind. We will give our firm backing to all who want a peaceful solution to the many challenges across the Middle East region.  This House  Parliament  knows just how difficult and how intractable the situation may seem. Too often, the region has been plagued by cycles of violence, rising extremism and economic hardship. At the same time, the conditions for Europeans and Americans to work together in the search for peace in the Middle East are probably better than ever. I have just returned from Washington where I had good discussions with everybody there in the Obama administration. I think I have the assurance from them that the strong commitment that has been expressed is a reality. We are willing and ready to work with them towards achieving success in this conflict.  I think the appointment of Senator Mitchell as US envoy has given the people in the Middle East and his friends renewed hope. We know him. We have worked with him. I had the privilege of working with him in  2001  on the famous report and just recently, I have had the opportunity to work with him in the region.  I hope very much that these changes will lead to a new approach, one that provides the parties with a greater say in how they manage their affairs. We know that solutions and proposals should be locally inspired. However, at the same time, deeper international engagement remains essential.  This is why the Arab Peace Initiative is so crucial. This initiative is the collective expression of the Arab world on how they could help to end their conflict with Israel. It is their response to the issue that has held back their development and their integration into our global world. It remains, and should remain, on the table.  We have just had important elections in Israel. Of course, it is for the Israeli people, their political leaders, to decide on the composition of their new government. From our side, we hope that the new prime minister and government will be solid interlocutors for peace talks.  Needless to say, the same applies to the Palestinians. They, too, have to get their house in order, including through reconciliation. As everybody knows, we strongly encourage intraPalestinian reconciliation behind President Abbas and all the efforts by Egypt and the Arab League in that direction. This will be a key to peace, stability and development.  As I said, I know that this Parliament has been deeply preoccupied with the crisis in Gaza, and so have we all. Let me use this occasion to highlight some of the most important international efforts, which focused on trying to end the violence and easing the plight of all civilian populations.  Egypts role in resolving the situation in Gaza, and indeed with the Palestinians themselves, remains crucial. We hope their efforts will soon lead to a durable and sustainable ceasefire, to the opening of the crossings for all goods and persons, and some sort of intraPalestinian agreement. Without this, it will be difficult  not to say impossible  to rebuild Gaza.  We are looking forward to welcoming positive announcements on the ceasefire. The day before yesterday, there were good meetings, and let us hope that they will continue today and in the future so that a ceasefire may be called, without delay. As you know, Egypt will also host an important conference on reconstruction on  2  March and we expect all the international community to make a commitment there. The European Union, too, played its role. We immediately expressed our willingness to contribute in concrete ways to a durable ceasefire. We also stated our readiness to redispatch our monitors to the Rafah crossing point, in accordance with the agreement that we signed in  2005 . We are ready to operate at Rafah, or at any other crossing points where help is needed or requested.  Several European countries also expressed their readiness to help the interdiction of illegal trafficking, in particular, arms smuggling, into Gaza. The activities of the European Parliament in response to the crisis have been significant and are part and parcel of the European Unions overall reaction to the crisis.  As far as the United Nations is concerned, we can warmly commend UNRWA for its work and perseverance and underline that the European Union will continue to support all its efforts.  But it is clear that no single country or organisation can tackle the conflicts in the Middle East alone. The very nature of the difficulties demands multilateral solutions. The Quartet will have a crucial role to play in the months ahead. The new US Administration, in cooperation with us, has confirmed its intention to make full use of the Quartet.  The terrible events in Gaza should also force us to take a more strategic and longterm look at Gaza. The Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied in  1967  and, without any doubt, will be part of a Palestinian state. Gaza needs to become economically and politically viable. Gaza needs to become part of a political solution.  The immediate priority remains to secure a durable and fully respected ceasefire and to allow for the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid. We need to see the opening of the crossings for humanitarian assistance, for commercial goods and for people, on a regular and predictable basis.  As you know, the diplomatic fallout of the Gaza conflict in the wider region has been very significant: indirect talks between Syria and Israel have been suspended; Mauritania and Qatar have suspended ties with Israel; a withdrawal of the Arab Peace Initiative was threatened.  Arab divisions, as you know, have deepened. Without Arab unity it will be very difficult to make progress in Gaza and in the wider Middle East peace process. Peace in the Middle East requires a united Arab world. The upcoming Arab League summit will be crucial to restore Arab unity, in particular, behind the Arab Peace Initiative.  In the coming months, we will also have elections in Iran and in Lebanon. On  12  June, the Iranians will vote for a new President. We have repeatedly stated our deep respect for Iran and our desire to forge a completely different kind of relationship with this country. This is clearly in everyones interests, but to achieve that, we need trust and that trust must be restored.  Let me conclude by saying that  2009  will be critical for the Middle East. We are possibly at a threshold. We can choose to pursue the same policies in the same manner, knowing that they will lead to the same results  the results that we know today. On the other hand, we can try to work with energy, with determination, to adjust our policies, to adjust the way we set about achieving results.  We have to work on both crisis management and conflict resolution  there is no doubt about that. However, the time has come to focus decisively on conflict resolution. It is the only way to end this endless sequence of death and destruction.  (Applause)
7882444 author: Annette White:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, we are at a moment of transition in the Middle East. Soon, most probably, there will be a new Israeli Government. There is already a new US administration, currently defining its foreign policy priorities. And we may soon face transition in the occupied Palestinian territory. So changing dynamics can create opportunities for new engagement.  However, there is no denying that the recent conflict resulted in enormous human suffering and destruction. It has left the Middle East peace process  we have to confess  in a particularly fragile state. This House knows that only too well, and I refer to the discussions and debates that we have already had here.  This is clearly not where we wanted to be at the beginning of  2009 . But if there is, some day, to be peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the only way forward is to do all we can to get the talks back on track. This human tragedy in Gaza has had a huge impact on the region. I returned only last night from a trip to Syria and Lebanon, and I will certainly also say something about that but, in particular, let me say that what we need to do is to make clear to all Israeli leaders that the EU expects sustained commitment to the peace process and to the twostate solution.  We also need to reinforce the message to the Palestinians that a strong Palestinian Authority with effective leadership over the entire occupied Palestinian territory is essential both for the reunification of the West Bank and Gaza and to get the peace process back on track. That is why the European Union is supporting the efforts of Egypt, Turkey and others to achieve this.  With the new US administration, we need to agree a joint way forward. I spoke on the phone to Secretary Clinton to that end only last week. She agreed on the need for a lasting ceasefire and a return to the peace process, which is absolutely crucial. We also agreed that the Quartet should consult closely on these matters before the end of the month. I am glad that the American administration sees the Quartet as a very important institution for going forward on peace.  Finally, we need to step up our own engagement with the Arab League countries. The consensus for peace is weakening, not only in Israel and within the occupied Palestinian territory, but also within the Arab League, where worrying divisions are appearing.  To that end, as I just said, I have just returned from Syria and Lebanon, where I met President Assad in Syria, President Sleiman in Lebanon, and other key partners. The recent conflict has badly damaged negotiations not only on the Palestinian, but also on the Syrian, track. We therefore exchanged views on the peace process at length. I reiterated the very strong support of the European Union for the Arab peace initiative, and I urged partners to maintain their commitment to it, because it offers a serious framework for regional peace talks.  I also stressed the milestone decision taken by Syria and Lebanon to establish diplomatic relations, and pushed for completion of all steps in this process. In both countries, we discussed practical ways in which the European Union could support the process of reform. In Lebanon, I reiterated our readiness in principle to deploy an EU election observation mission, and I have already decided that an exploratory mission should go there immediately.  The European Union as a whole has been extremely active in recent weeks both on the political and practical fronts. On the political front, since I last reported to you in January, we have all pursued our intensive diplomatic activity. We have been at the forefront of calls for a ceasefire and have worked with Egypt and others to make a lasting ceasefire possible.  The Council conclusions in January indicated that the EU is developing a work plan for a lasting ceasefire. This document identifies six areas for action including humanitarian response, the prevention of smuggling to Gaza, the reopening of the Gaza crossing points, reconstruction, intraPalestinian reconciliation and the resumption of the peace process.  Much very delicate work is going on. To give but a flavour of the pace of activity we have all been involved in: for instance, I was at a working dinner of the Paris CoChairs on  15  January, the Summit meetings in Sharm elSheikh and Jerusalem on  18  January, and EU ministerial meetings with Israel on  21  January and with a group composed of Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Turkey on  25  January. In addition, Commissioner Louis Michel, who is responsible for humanitarian aid, visited Gaza on  24  and  25  January.  We are in regular contact with Quartet colleagues. We had important meetings as a troika in Moscow. I had this telephone conversation with Clinton; Javier Solana was there in Washington, and we are agreed on the need to renew the peace process. We continue our road map monitoring work, and we also deploy statebuilding assistance, including in sensitive areas such as the rule of law and border management.  The EUs action strategy for the Middle East also foresees EU support for specific final status issues, for instance, for Jerusalem, refugees and security arrangements.  In practical terms, the EU has prioritised delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. The Commission has already mobilised EUR  10  million practically overnight, and another EUR  32  million has now been committed for the coming period.  In early March, the Egyptian Government is organising an international conference in Sharm elSheikh in support of the Palestinian economy for the reconstruction of Gaza. We, as the Commission, will be a cosponsor of this event. I am delighted that I had the opportunity to discuss the pledge that the Commission intends to make with the Chairs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets at an early stage here in Parliament on  2  February. Thank you again for your support.  The problem at the moment is not only funding, but access, particularly to Gaza. We have been very vocal, both in public and in private, about the unacceptable closure of the Gaza crossings. This House will wish to join me today in calling, once again, for the crossings to be fully opened.  (Applause)  When access does improve  as I have no doubt it will  we may then have to review our financial forecast. At that point, I may need to come back to discuss this with you. I hope I will again be able to count on your support.  Honourable Members, you can count on the commitment of the Commission  and also on my personal commitment  to do everything in our power to help bring peace as swiftly as possible to one of the most troubled parts of the world. We will certainly continue to work very closely with this House.  (Applause)
3275403 author: Christoph Reid:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, it is a pleasure to be here today to talk about children and also about the report you will adopt shortly.  Let me talk for a few minutes about how we got to where we are today, and what will come in the future, and about child participation, which is most likely our biggest challenge regarding children.  Today is an important step in a long process that started several years ago internally in the Commission. We recognise that the EU needs a strategy on children. We need a strategy on how we, the European Union, will implement the commitments. We and the rest of the world have signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The first step was the Commission communication Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child in  2006 . This was followed in  2008  by the communication package on children in external actions, which outlined a comprehensive approach to children by the EU using all available instruments in external cooperation.  Let me digress for a moment, since I am convinced that some of you will be asking the question: what about the EU strategy on the rights of the child, which was announced in the abovementioned communication? I can confirm that the Commission is working on such a strategy, which will be presented under the next Commission.  During the Slovenian Presidency in May  2008 , the Council adopted conclusions on the promotion and protection of the rights of the child in the European Unions external action  the development of humanitarian dimensions.  The Committee on Development then started drafting a report. We are now at the end of this process and tomorrow, you will be voting on this excellent report.  In addition, the EUs policy on children is based on the two EU guidelines  the Guidelines on Children in Armed Conflicts and the Guidelines on the Rights of the Child  both being implemented in a number of selected priority and pilot countries. The Commission welcomes the report  which is an excellent complement to our communication  the Council conclusions and the guidelines. We will surely use it in our work on children.  Let me focus my final comments on what is probably our biggest challenge today: child participation. How do we ensure that we involve children in decisions that concern them? How do we ensure that children have access to pertinent information? How do we ensure equal access for children to express their views? We have to recognise that, amongst everything that we all agreed to in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, this might be the major challenge.  We have to admit that we are still far from achieving anything significant in the area of child participation. In the Commission, we are starting to reflect on how to design and implement proper child participation that is not just tokenism. It should be relevant, meaningful and informed child participation. We have also ensured relevant funding for child participation under the thematic programme Investing in People.  Why is this difficult for us adults? Essentially, because it questions what is fundamental to us: the way we behave.  What will the Commission do in its external action to promote this participation? The Commission will make the tools available for our delegations to consult children, but these tools will be used not only by our delegations but also by partner countries. We are also developing a tool kit, together with UNICEF, that should not only address child participation but also overall child protection, legal reform, child budgeting.  In addition to the tool kit, we are also recasting and strengthening our collaboration with UNICEF in general in order to be able to improve our support to partner countries in their efforts to ensure that children have a voice at country level.  We also cooperate closely with various NGOs to learn from them about possible formats, often involving children and having meaningful child participation. Let me be honest: it is not going to happen tomorrow. This is just the start of a long process.  Let me just make one comment on the report. The report underlines how the Commission should pay attention to child participation, but, colleagues, you will also have to do so, and I can assure you that the Commission will be happy to work with you on advancing this. We should build on the collective force of the two institutions to advance this important issue.  Let me once again express the Commissions appreciation of the report and underline that we will do our utmost to carry out these recommendations. We are counting on the continued support of Parliament in this area.  In answer to Ms Kinnocks question, I am happy to confirm that the position of the Commission has not changed. The idea of using  2009  for consultations was launched in the Commission itself and we are working to put in place the conditions for a process of consultation with children that avails itself of all existing tools.  Let me also underline that the Commission is keen to ensure a process of consultation that fully respects the rights of the child.  Finally, let me thank you, Ms Kinnock, for a very fruitful collaboration on children and childrelated issues, not only as regards this report, but also over the years. I know that I was too long, but you can never be too long when you are talking about childrens rights.
4757047 author: Michael White:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to address this partsession of the European Parliament covering, inter alia, the subject of the Commissions assessment of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs), which was presented in the Second Strategic Energy Review package in November  2008  and the earlier Commission communication of January  2008 .  A more detailed technical synthesis of the Commissions assessment of the NEEAPs will be presented in the Commissions NEEAP document this spring.  I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gyrk, on his work, as well as the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) for its valuable discussions and comments.  In the past few years, the Commission has stated very clearly that energy efficiency is the first priority of the European Union energy policy and a very important cornerstone to meeting the  2020  by  2020  targets, and National Energy Efficiency Action Plans play a central role in this respect. The Directive on energy enduse efficiency and energy services sets an obligation, as you know, for the Member States to present these, and to show how, in practice, they are going to achieve their national targets for energy efficiency.  The original deadline for their submission by the Member States was  30  June  2007  but, as you know, many Member States unfortunately were late. The last NEEAPs arrived at the Commission in June  2008 .  At this stage, the Commission has completed all the individual assessments and sent letters with the results of those assessments to all Member States. As a followup, a number of bilateral meetings took place, and a number of Member States declared they would themselves like to improve their NEEAPs in the coming few months. As has been noted by the members of the ITRE Committee, the first National Energy Efficiency Action Plans have proved to be a really useful exercise. Indeed, many Member States have, for the first time, prepared comprehensive plans of action on energy savings. Many of them confirmed that they found the crosssectoral effort needed to prepare them very useful.  Under the Energy Services Directive, NEEAPs have only a limited role. However, the Commission, in its communication of November  2008 , and in other recent statements has always encouraged Member States to broaden their role.  The Commission will prepare a new European Union Energy Savings Action Plan that will strengthen and better focus European Union actions, helping EU Member States and EU businesses and EU citizens to save energy in a costeffective way.  In your report, you urged the Commission to propose a binding target for energy savings. The current energy savings objective of  20  of primary energy saving in  2020  today represents a nonbinding target, as you know. However, the Commission believes that, with the climate and energy package, as well as the proposals in the Second Strategic Energy Review, we can reach  20 .  Mr Gyrks report also rightly indicated that financial support must be increased. Financial issues relating to energy savings were recognised by the Commission in the European Economic Recovery Plan of  26  November  2008 , and in other coordinated efforts which aim to help create jobs, which are often in small and mediumsized companies, since investments in energy efficiency, and especially in buildings, are mostly related to smallscale renovation projects.  In conclusion, I would like to recall that during the mandate of this Commission, EU leaders have given a real commitment to promoting energy efficiency. Boosting investment in energy efficiency and related new technologies offers an essential contribution to sustainable development and also to security of supply. Energy efficiency has a wider impact, far beyond energy policy. It has a positive effect on the European Union economy in general: increasing efficiency helps create new jobs, stimulates economic growth and improves competitiveness. As you rightly mentioned, that is exactly what we should be doing in these difficult and challenging times.
2045393 author: Jennifer McNabb:  on behalf of the PSE Group.  Madam President, I am very pleased indeed to have this opportunity to discuss this debate. It is only unfortunate that we are doing it on a Thursday afternoon when it is not quite as well attended as perhaps it should be.  I do think this is an important debate in the context of the current economic climate. We have already heard discussion about culture and jobs and how culture industries and people working in culture can contribute to the economy and can really help. At the precarious times we are facing now  which we have heard already in this Parliament  it is important that we discuss these matters as fully as we can.  I am here also because I do actually represent one of those big cities that the previous speaker mentioned. London, as you all know, is one of the cultural centres of the EU with  as we all have  enormous history and very much to offer. It is also the centre of, certainly the British, cultural industries. So I think I have a role here to speak for the people that I represent and to fight for those jobs which, when things get bad, are very often the first jobs to go. So I very much welcome what the Commission has said about the role of cultural industries, about how we want to preserve and to build on those and how there is an economic role for culture. I feel that, very often, that economic role is ignored, and we do not talk about it; we do not even think about it, and we relegate culture to secondclass status. That is not acceptable, particularly when culture can be so very important in our national and regional development. I hope that one of the things to come out of this debate today  that we take back to our Member States, and the Commission and the Council take back  is that we are very concerned about how this regional development happens, how we deal with this and the role that culture can play in that.  Also, as Mrs Pack has already said, there is the whole question of cultural diversity. I think one of the great strengths of the EU, and of the European Parliament, is that we all come together  now with  27  Member States  and are actually very different, in many ways: different backgrounds and cultures, and obviously different languages. That is just a start. Although the world is getting smaller and although people come together more, there are still these significant differences. We should be celebrating them, because those differences are at the very core of the things that we talk about. We all want to preserve our identities and how we feel about ourselves, and we need to do that.  In this context, I think we also need to take on board that we are getting people coming into our continent. We are getting people from other parts of the world  many of whom are now in second and third generations in some of our Member States  who come from different backgrounds again. I think we also need to take on board that they come with their own culture, tradition and languages. Although we integrate them and they learn our languages, they are still there with their own separate identities. That is an issue which has not been mentioned in this debate, which I think is an important one and one that we, I hope, can integrate, particularly when we talk about issues such as multilingualism, which we have had good debates on. It is an extremely important issue, and I think one we should perhaps give more prominence to than we have done, but in the context of a Europe which is changing. We therefore need to preserve our existing cultures and our existing diversity and actually absorb the new diversity which has come, and which is continuing to come, into our continent. For all of these reasons, I welcome the support that we are giving to culture and to cultural industries, support to small and mediumenterprises, which I think  in the current economic climate  are possibly going to be the backbone of what we will be looking at. If large corporations and large enterprises are losing people, making people redundant and laying people off, it may well be up to the smaller outfits  the SMEs  to pick up this slack and to actually go out there and create employment for those who can work in this sector.  So I hope we will all recognise just how important the role of culture is in our continent and our society and that those of us who have actually turned up for this debate will take the message back to our Member States, to the regions and to the people we represent. I know we have got a good message to say, so let us go out there and spread the word.
8243874 author: Sebastian Reid:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, debates on Russia are never easy. Russia, on the one hand, is an important global partner, but, on the other hand, it is also a big neighbour, and there I think you have two sides that do not always easily converge.  On the one hand, being a global partner, we see Russia as a real partner, as I said before. For instance, in the Middle East, in seeking a solution between Israel and Palestine and on many other of these issues. Or on Afghanistan and Pakistan, yesterday in the conference in The Hague, Russia had an important part to play; or on Iran, or on the nonproliferation issues, or on the big global issues like climate change, which was also mentioned, or now the financial and economic crisis. Everybody is being affected by that. This is true for us, but it is also true for Russia and for many other global partners. Therefore I think we have to see this very clearly, but at the same time we also have to see Russia as a great neighbour, where sometimes we do not see eye to eye in the common neighbourhood. And we have a common neighbourhood  some of you have mentioned that, be it Moldova or NagornoKarabakh or, of course, Georgia. There we have to make sure we come much closer to each other, but also speak frankly on the difficulties and the differences that exist.  One of these issues is the Eastern Partnership, and we discussed the Eastern Partnership only last week in Parliament. The chief goal of the Eastern Partnership, which is concerned with six of our neighbouring countries, is to help those countries who want to come much more into line with the European Union on certain key issues like standards of governments, freer trade and others. In these activities, I think it is important that we have these countries as partners. But at the same time we have also said, on the multilateral platform, that we are, in principle, open to third countries like Russia on an ad hoc basis, as appropriate; certainly Russia is also a full member in the Black Sea Synergy, where regional matters are handled.  So there is also a chance to work together in order to overcome some difficulties that exist. On the other hand, gas. With gas, we know  I said it clearly before and I will repeat it  we are interdependent; we know that. As we also know, the gas crisis has diminished the trust in our partners. It has underlined the importance of energy provisions in the coming EURussia and EUUkraine agreements, and they will be there.  We must step up the work to create an internal energy market, but also increase efficiency and diversify supplies. The new agreement with Russia should therefore lay down, as we always say, legally binding reciprocal commitments. And, in parallel to the new agreement and for the short term, we are working with Russia to make the early warning mechanism more efficient, as I said before. We should also foresee monitoring and conflict prevention and resolution, and this should also involve Belarus and Ukraine.  We know that Russia is a very important energy partner for us, contributing  40  of the gas we import and  20  of the gas we consume. This is, as I said before, a relationship of interdependence. Since we represent over two thirds of their export revenue  which has made a very significant contribution to Russias economic development  it is essential that there should be no repeat of the events of last January, and therefore we are working with both the Ukrainians and the Russians to prevent that.  On human rights we do not always see eye to eye. On the one hand, the EU and Russia share common international commitments, as I said, through the instruments that we have signed together at the UN, at the OECD and at the Council of Europe. These commitments reflect values and include the obligation to respect the decisions of the bodies they set up. That is particularly true for the European Court of Human Rights, but it is also evident that the EU and Russia interpret commitments differently.  The European Union and Russia have chosen the path of dialogue on these issues, and this is the right way. This means that we must also listen to the concerns the Russian side expresses sometimes with regard to some developments inside the European Union including, for instance, the issue of Russianspeaking minorities.  But it is also true, as the PresidentinOffice of the Council said, that there are clear concerns about the failure to respect human rights in the Russian Federation, and continuing cases of attacks on human rights defenders, journalists and others reflect badly on Russia.  We raise these issues regularly with the high authorities: myself with Sergey Lavrov, and President Barroso with his interlocutors. We also use our twiceyearly human rights consultations to do so as well. The discussions in the bilateral meeting between President Barroso and President Medvedev on  6  February also included an exchange on human rights.  President Medvedev himself suggested that these exchanges continue at the  2122  May summit, and we shall take him up on that. For instance, the attack on human rights activist Lev Ponomarev last night is the latest reminder of how difficult the situation for human rights defenders is in Russia. But let me say that the two strands have clearly been reflected in the mandate that the Council has given the Commission to negotiate. Both are there, and this is the content of our mandate. Therefore, I think the right way is to follow up on this mandate and, as I said, we are always ready to report on the follow up of our negotiations, as we have just been doing.
7894485 author: Marc Cameron:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for its interest in the Arctic and also say how much we appreciated your resolution on Arctic governance last October. It gave political impetus to the Commissions own work on the communication that has already been mentioned, The EU and the Arctic region, which was adopted last November.  Now, why is this so important? We share your concern that the Arctic region deserves international attention as never ever before. Scientific evidence shows that climate change is occurring much faster in the Arctic than in the rest of the world. In the past six years alone, the ice cap has lost up to half its thickness near the North Pole and may have passed a tipping point. That is a clear warning sign we would be foolish to ignore. The radical transformation of the Arctic is having an impact on its people, its landscape and its wildlife  on land and at sea.  Therefore, now is the time to act. That is why we adopted the communication, which is the first step towards an EU policy for the Arctic, laying the foundations for a more comprehensive approach. The communication focuses on three broad goals: protecting and preserving the Arctic, in full cooperation with its inhabitants; promoting the sustainable use of resources; and beefing up multilateral governance.  The proposals in the communication are the outcome of a very thorough analysis made by the Commission. This involved consultations with all main Arctic stakeholders, including both EU and nonEU Arctic states. This was all the more necessary because many EU activities and key developments of global scope, such as the integrated maritime policy or climate change, have an effect on the Arctic.  So, based on these discussions and in light of the motion for a resolution tabled for discussion today, let me stress that the Arctic region differs from the Antarctic in a number of key aspects. Unlike the Antarctic, which is a vast, uninhabited continent surrounded by an ocean, the Arctic is a maritime space, surrounded by inhabited land belonging to sovereign countries.  So the idea of establishing a binding legal regime specifically designed for the Arctic is, unfortunately, difficult, because none of the five Arctic Ocean coastal states  Denmark, Norway, Canada, Russia and the United States  is in favour of such a regime. I therefore fear that such a proposal would at this stage not only be ineffective but could prove to be detrimental to the EUs role and credibility in overall Arctic cooperation. Rather than expending efforts on that cause, the EUs interests and objectives are better served by building greater multilateral cooperation and making better use of the existing legal instruments.  Through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and other general conventions, there is already an extensive international legal framework in place. The UNCLOS is also the basis for settling disputes, including maritime delimitation. We want to see these conventions fully implemented and, very importantly, adapted to the Arctic specificities. For example, we propose a regulatory framework for sustainable fisheries management where areas and species are not yet covered by other instruments.  Secondly, we will work closely with the International Maritime Organisation, developing and enforcing solid international standards for safer Arctic navigation, respecting human safety and environmental sustainability. This means either extending existing legislation or adopting new legislation.  Thirdly, we will also defend the internationally recognised principles of freedom of navigation and the right of innocent passage. Coastal states should avoid discriminatory steps concerning navigational rules. Any measures will have to be applied in full compliance with the International Law of the Sea.  Fourthly, it is not realistic to propose an international moratorium on the extraction of Arctic resources. The bulk of the estimated reserves of minerals, oil and gas are either on the sovereign territory of the Arctic states or in their exclusive economic zones, and some of them have farreaching plans for further exploration activities. However, we insist that the extraction and use of Arctic resources must always adhere to the highest possible standards for the environment and sustainability.  We share Parliaments concerns about the urgency of action in this region, and our communication puts forward a set of coherent and specific proposals. Based on this, we look forward to continued cooperation with you as we develop an EU Arctic policy.  Let us never lose sight of our common goal, and let us work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations.
1457850 author: Nancy Bauer:  on behalf of the PSE Group.  Mr President, there are different tools to sanction environmentconscious behaviour in our societies. There are regulations, directives, resolutions. We can forbid certain materials and activities. We can have a ban on dangerous substances and subsidise green technology.  But in a market economy there are other tools as well. We can target consumers through the products they buy, recommending those products which are environmentally friendly and fit the requirement of sustainable development.  This directive takes an important step in the right direction by simplifying the passage toward getting the Ecolabel. The Socialist Group supports the report. My comrades and I have tabled many amendments to it, and those amendments are either favoured by the Committee on the Environment or their spirit is built into the compromise package. So our group will vote in favour of the report at the final vote today.  We think that the environmental effect of products must be a very important issue in the EU, and the whole idea of an Ecolabel gives a very useful orientation for consumers.  Of course the Ecolabel should be given to the most environmentally friendly products, and the information should be clear and correct. In these hard times of the economic crisis, we should respect the interests of producers as well, and I am sure that this report balances the interests of the consumers and industry.  It is very important to involve small and mediumsized enterprises in the Ecolabel process and, therefore, the cost of the authorisation cannot be too high. I, as a shadow rapporteur of the Socialist Group, pushed the report in the direction of even lower costs, and I thank the rapporteur for accepting our arguments.  For the SMEs I mentioned, it is obvious that we should have to abolish the bureaucratic difficulty of the authorisation. We have to simplify the procedure for getting the Ecolabel because, in its present form, the decision procedure is very slow and bureaucratic.  Mostly the smaller enterprises do not have enough money, time and energy for the slow process of getting an Ecolabel. It is very important to analyse the whole life cycle of a product, from production to destruction. It is not enough to judge the environmental characteristics of the readymade product; the substances of the product, the process of production, the transport of the goods and the method for its destruction or decomposition should also be studied before an Ecolabel is given.  It is obvious, at least to us Socialists, that the products which have gained an Ecolabel must not contain dangerous substances. It was a very difficult question during our debates, but finally we were able to reach a very good compromise about dangerous substances.  The main rule is that Ecolabelled products must not contain dangerous substances, but there can be some very few exceptions. Specific goods which do not have equivalent alternatives, and which have a higher overall environmental performance compared with other goods of the same category, may get exceptions. The best and most wellknown example is the energysaving light bulb, which has many environmental advantages but contains mercury.  The issue of foodstuffs has also been widely debated. In this case the criteria should be further developed. The Ecolabel has a real added environmental value. It considers the whole life cycle of the product, and the use of the Ecolabel should not cause confusion in the minds of consumers when compared with other food labels. The Commission shall adopt measures to establish specific Ecolabel criteria for each product group, including foodstuffs. Not later than three months after the final report and the draft criteria, the Commission shall consult the European Union Ecolabel board on a draft proposal on this issue.  As I have already said, the Ecolabel shall be based on environmental performance throughout the life cycle of the best products on the internal market. That is why the report allows for setting the ambition level of Ecolabel criteria on a casebycase basis between  10  and  20  of the best performing products on the market, thus ensuring that the scheme rewards only the most environmentally friendly products but offers sufficient choice to consumers.
4021102 author: Amy White:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Mr President, I have listened very attentively to the different assessments and views expressed. This is, as has been pointed out, a most important debate on a most important subject.  I think it can fairly be said that we stand united in our assessment of what has been happening, what we have seen on the television screens and, more importantly, what we have heard from the people who know even more than what can be seen on the television screens.  I would like to take issue with someone who said we have not been clear enough. If you make a comparison with what the European Union has said, and what every other significant world body of actors has said, there is no question that we are the ones that have been the most clear, the most consistent, the strongest in the words that we have used.  We would have wished those words to have more of an effect than they already have, but that is often the case. But, while words are, nevertheless, important  no question about that  we are discussing primarily what has been happening in Iran since the election on  12  June.  I think it is important also to focus on what we saw on the television screens before  12  June, because that was suddenly a somewhat different Iran from the one we were used to. There was an element within the boundaries of the regime, certainly, of vitality, an element of plurality, an obvious desire for change, for openness, for reform. Whether that represented the majority of Iranians or not is very difficult to judge from the outside, but that it was significant is testified not least by the force of the crackdown that we saw after  12  June. So in condemning what we have seen after, we should not forget what we saw before and the longterm significance of that.  I think we are united in what we say and what we think. Mr SaryuszWolski, Mr CohnBendit and Mr Mauro: virtually the same, if we look at what we are assessing. But the most difficult thing is not what we say; the most difficult thing is what we do faced with this situation. I think we must then operate along two lines.  The first one is fairly obvious. The European Union must be the clear voice for human rights and democracy wherever and under whatever circumstances. There might be other factors coming into consideration of policy as well, but it should not dilute in any way from the consistency of our defence for human rights. So we must condemn the killings, the use of the death sentence. We must call for the release of those detained. We must be clear in our call for full respect for the freedom and the rights that are there for every human being in our world.  Secondly  and I think here there might be some dissent  we must also be prepared to engage. I say that, recognising that that is a far more difficult policy than just to stand back, do nothing or try to isolate: that is easy; to engage is difficult. Mr Kelam alluded to some of the historical experience we have, with the balancing act that that entails. But the fact that we have a certain amount of historical experience in Europe  reflected not the least here  perhaps makes it possible for us to venture along that particular road.  We should never believe that just a diplomatic dialogue can sort out every issue that has been addressed here: it cannot. Other factors will come in to that particular equation. But neither should we forget that there are some issues that we have a duty to seek to resolve through diplomatic dialogue. I am thinking of the individuals employed at the British Embassy, or the French student and others, that we must deal with now in a dialogue.  I come from a country where  1  of our citizens have a background in Iran. They move back and forth. We have consular issues that are of a multitude that is difficult to fathom. We need to be prepared to engage, to help individuals in different cases, without believing that that is going to sort out everything at once.  We have the nuclear dossier that has been alluded to. There might be others who believe there are far more simple solutions to that. I do not think there is any solution if we do not engage in a true diplomatic dialogue on that. Those are other issues that we need to engage on.  This is obviously going to be more demanding and more difficult in the circumstances that we now have, there is no question about that, and I think the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week highlighted some of the difficult choices and some of the difficult judgements that we have to make in not only the coming weeks, but months  but not very much longer than that. Here we must engage  you, us in the Council and us as Europeans  with other significant international actors, not only with Americans with a new and good approach by the Obama Administration, but also engage with others  the UN Security Council, Russia, China, and with the wider world community. It is only then that we can hope to be able to start resolving not only the immediate issues, but also the other issues that need to be addressed.  I am grateful for this debate. I think it has highlighted the clear unanimity that we have when it comes to defending our values, but it has also highlighted some of the difficult choices and balancing acts that we have to engage in in the months and years ahead. We know what we want to achieve; we must also seek to achieve it. But do not think it is going to be easy. I can assure you that the Council will continue to be very much engaged with all aspects of this particular dossier.  (Applause)
7122035 author: Sebastian Whittacker:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, the public financing of OpelVauxhall by one or more European governments is the issue that I will address.  As you know, last Thursday, the Opel Trust, in which General Motors (GM) and the German authorities have equal representation, announced that it has approved the sale by GM of a majority stake in its European OpelVauxhall operations to the consortium of Magna International and Sberbank. This decision by the owners of Opel has been supported by the German Government. The German Government promised to grant public funds of up to EUR  4 . 5  billion to the new Opel, with the possible participation of other European governments.  Mr President, the Commission has kept in touch with all the Member States concerned throughout the process which led to this transaction and the Commission is also aware of the controversies regarding the respective merits of the restructuring plans presented by different bidders, including the doubt publicly expressed by certain members of the Opel Trust.  Concerning the public financing of the GMMagna transaction, we have been informed that the German Government intends to avail itself of a preexisting approved scheme under the Commissions temporary framework for State aid measures to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis.  Mr President, I intend to verify carefully whether this scheme can be used in this case and you will certainly understand that I cannot take a position at this stage since the deal is not yet finalised and, by the way, a number of aspects are still being negotiated. However, at this moment, it is quite important that I should outline to you the most relevant considerations. In particular, I have to underline that State aid granted under the temporary framework cannot be subject, de jure or de facto, to additional conditions concerning location of investments or the geographic distribution of restructuring efforts. Such conditions would create  and I am quite clear on this  unacceptable distortions in the internal markets and could trigger a subsidy race which would significantly damage the European economy at the present, very delicate moment. Moreover, if the restructuring of a European company was determined by noncommercial conditions attached to public financing, there would be a risk that a company would not be able to restore its longterm viability, and that risk to viability is all the greater due to the current weakened state of the entire European car industry. The European car industry, as we are all aware, suffers from considerable overcapacity. So a failed restructuring would result in great damage for the company and for its workers, in negative spillovers for the whole sector, and in a waste of taxpayers money. And those principles will be my guidance in my assessment in the Opel case.  I will verify whether noncommercial protectionist conditions are attached to public funding, de jure or de facto, and the Commission will examine not only the legal conditions that may be attached to a final aid package, but also the entire context in which the aid is granted. And I will be particularly interested to find out whether the German authorities have effectively linked the provision of aid to a single bidder and, if so, to find out why they regarded that bidders business plan as preferable from an industrial and commercial point of view.  In the short term, it is a sad fact that, because of the current state of overcapacity in the car industry, any plan to restore the profitability of OpelVauxhall will require job losses across the company as a whole and planned closures; all the plans to save OpelVauxhall presented by different potential investors have foreseen both plant closures and job cuts. However, a social restructuring is the only way to ensure viable and stable jobs for the future, and the Commission cannot, and should not, try to dictate where such cuts will fall, nor can it try to prevent them. We will, however, be scrutinising the process very carefully to ensure that it is based on commercial considerations designed to sustain viable jobs and not protectionist motives.
5994139 author: Sebastian Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, a large potential for new exporting opportunities lies in the Asian markets that have high growth rates but also, of course, high barriers to entry. Apart from the multilateral talks, an important way to overcome these barriers is through the leverage available to us in free trade agreement negotiations.  That is why Member States have asked the Commission to launch a new generation of trade agreements with key Asian economies. These free trade agreements should be ambitious in creating new exporting opportunities for many sectors.  With Korea, this is what we have achieved after two intensive years of negotiations. This is the most ambitious free trade agreement ever negotiated by the European Union.  There is consensus in that in two of the three main sectors of our economy, the benefits from the free trade agreement are overwhelmingly in our favour: first of all, our competitive service providers will gain massively from the agreement. For example, in areas such as telecoms, transport, construction and environmental services, doing business in Korea will be much easier in the future.  Secondly, for agricultural products, Korea will eliminate almost all of its particularly high tariffs  they average  35 ! That will give a boost to farming exports of, amongst other things, pork, wine, whisky or dairy products. We will also secure the protection of European geographical indications, such as Parma ham, Rioja or Tokay.  But the free trade agreement will also bring major benefits to European manufacturing exporters. Overall, European manufacturing exporters will save some EUR  1 . 2  billion of tariffs annually, of which EUR  800  million are saved on day one. For example, exporters of machineries would save EUR  450  million annually on annual duty payments while exporters of chemicals would save over EUR  150  million on duties.  Duty elimination will also allow our exporters to strengthen their foothold in the Korean market, and thus expand sales. Korean customers buy some EUR  25  billion worth of EU goods every year. This makes Korea one of our most important export markets in Asia.  In addition, there was a special focus on rules. The agreement includes transparency on regulation, efficient enforcement of commitments, better protection of intellectual property rights and WTOplus rules on subsidies which will all be to the benefit of all manufacturers selling in Korea.  Moreover, ambitious disciplines have been established on industrial technical barriers to trade, notably for cars, electronics and pharmaceuticals based on the regulatory model of Europe and they respond to longstanding demands by European business in these sectors. Korea will need to changes its domestic regulations to comply with these commitments, whereas no such change would be needed in Europe.  Concerning the car industry specifically, I want to signal first of all that we also have an interest in enhancing market access for European cars in Korea. Our car exporters are by far the strongest importers on the Korean market, with strong growth rates. They can develop this further since they will benefit from the combination of elimination of tariffs  EUR  2   000  saved on a car worth EUR  25   000   and the removal of technical obstacles.  The agreement negotiated includes the most ambitious disciplines for nontariff barriers ever negotiated with a third country. Korea will accept from day one that a car that conforms to international standards will be considered as complying with those Korean regulations that have been signalled by our industry as representing significant obstacles.  There are also provisions by which Korea accepts the equivalence between European and Korean environmental regulations. Indeed, even before the agreement enters into force, Korea has agreed to apply certain transitional derogations from the Korean environmental standards important for our exporters and we are monitoring very closely discussions in Korea about new regulations to limit CO 2  emissions in order to make them show that they are not an impediment to trade.  We are aware of the sensitivities of the car sector. We defended long transition periods for the liberalisation of our most sensitive car segment, namely small cars. Tariffs will only be eliminated in year five of the agreement, and that allows time for adjustment. We should remember the significant Korean investment in the car sector in Europe.  Moderately, we have changed the rules of origin by increasing the permissible limit of foreign value in Korean cars from  40  to  45 , and we agreed a bilateral safeguard clause which lets us put up tariffs in case of a surge of imports and a threat of injury to our industries.  On duty drawback, my final point, this is nothing new. Such policies are legitimate under the World Trade Organisation. Duty drawback also does not create a significant competitive disadvantage for our car producers since our tariffs on car parts are generally very low and will be further reduced. And we have negotiated a special clause that would enable us to limit duty drawback efficiently.  I underline the strength of support from European manufacturing sectors, as well as agriculture and service organisations, for this agreement. This is important, and it is a clear signal of our determination to pursue market access interest in key emerging Asian economies.
1699130 author: Helen Cameron:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I would like to say that the debate did not, in a sense, at all surprise me, because the concerns that colleagues have raised have indeed been raised over the months.  I want to pay tribute to David Martin, just to begin with, for the work that he has done in the committee. It is very important that I recognise how much the Committee on International Trade has worked with me over the months that have proceeded it, and of course I am very well aware that colleagues have not had the benefit of seeing the detail of the agreement so far. So I will try and address the concerns. But, more importantly, we will make sure that we give you more and more detail, because it is important that you look at the facts rather than the assertions that will have been made.  Let me just make some general points about the approach on this deal first. This deal was put in play in order to achieve the best for European industry  including, I would say to colleagues from the UKIP, British industry. It is absolutely in the interests of Europe, in my view, to move forward with this deal  otherwise I would not be standing here suggesting that we move forward in the way that I have.  Now, in doing so, there was a clear modus operandi, a clear approach that the Commission took which, as has been said, was supported by Parliament, by the Commission and by the Council, and that is indeed the way we have gone forward. My colleague, Mr Arif, will not mind, I think, if I say that to suggest that I would sacrifice any industry, I find alarming or perhaps a little depressing, because that is certainly not the approach that I would take.  Do I think that if you want a serious trade deal you have to recognise that actually it is a deal where both sides benefit? Yes, I do. If you want to have trade agreements, if we do believe  which I think we do  that trade is the engine that will take us out of recession, then it means you have serious, tough negotiations with industries and with countries that we care about having a deal with. Otherwise, we can just do deals all day long with countries we do not much care about, and we can open markets because we are not really interested.  Korea is a serious market. It provides real opportunities for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, other industries. We need to recognise the value and importance of doing this if we want serious trade agreements. We are, in fact, an economic superpower. I could not disagree more with my colleagues from the United Kingdom when they talk about Switzerland and try and equate that, somehow, with the relationship that we are trying to form in Europe with Korea  or maybe I just missed the point.  This is about serious negotiations to get a serious outcome and, as the details of this unfold, I hope that colleagues will look at it in the spirit that we have tried to set it up.  The car industry gave us at the beginning a list of things that they wished us to achieve. They were genuinely very concerned to keep the market in Korea open, and we have achieved all that they asked at the beginning.  The textile industry: I am confident that there is little to worry about. The textile industry safeguards that we have will indeed make sure that we retain European jobs.  I am not interested in closing down jobs or industries in Europe at all, and this deal does not do that. And those of you who think that you have evidence to prove it, I ask you to supply it to me, because the rhetoric is one thing, the reality is a different thing, and we really have got to get beyond the rhetoric and into the reality of what this deal provides.  Indeed, I would argue that what we have got before us is very important for all the industrial sectors. The question about duty drawback is, for me, a very simple one. Duty drawback is designed so that our response to it will prevent a particular problem. The question is, is it the only way of solving a problem? If there are other ways that equally solve the problem but, in fact, invite us to get a better trade agreement, then I will explore them. But I still want to solve the same problem, and I believe the mechanisms we have in place in this agreement do precisely that. It is not some thing that we hold up as being for ever enshrined as the only way of achieving what we want to achieve  to prevent, effectively, imports via the back door  and I believe we have resolved the problem in a different way.  So I am not going to make apologies  politically, economically or in any other way  to Parliament for having gone out and invested in negotiating this important trade deal. I make no apology for that, and I make no apology for putting forward to this Parliament what I believe is a serious,  21 st century free trade agreement of enormous benefit across the economy of the European Union. I especially make no apology for doing it at a time of economic crisis because, if ever there was a time when my responsibility was to provide as much support for the businesses and the workers of Europe, I believe that time is now, and that is what this deal does.  I do urge colleagues, as I said earlier on, to look at the reality of the deal. You will be lobbied  I have been lobbied  but actually, when you look at what we have achieved, I believe it is a very concrete result that will hugely benefit the economy of Europe. That, in the end, is what we set out to do, and that, in the end, is what we have achieved.
8233961 author: Roger LaCourt:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, the Commission in its role as the EUs representative in the G 20 , together with the Presidency, strongly advocates increased support to lowincome countries, particularly the poorest, as one of the critical priorities of the G 20  commitments.  In this regard, it is important that low income countries receive appropriate funding to meet the needs emerging especially from the backlash of the financial crisis. That is why we advocate the need to enhance access by poor and fragile countries, often without institutional administrative capacities, to the facilities and credits made available by the international financial institutions and other donors.  Personally, I will defend this approach at the November Development Affairs Council, and the global financial crisis will be at the centre of my political concerns during the weeks ahead. I hope I can count on your support throughout.  In this context our Vulnerability FLEX instrument is of particular relevance. The Commission has worked with the World Bank and the IMF to identify the most crisisvulnerable countries and to complement the loanbased assistance provided by these two institutions with timely and targeted grant aid under the Vulnerability FLEX.  Between  2009  and  2010 , up to EUR  500  million will be spent on those ACP countries requesting assistance to ensure priority public spending, including in the social sectors. Let me reassure you that the frontloading of budget support through the Vulnerability FLEX mechanism will not lead to a funding gap insofar as the Commission is using nonearmarked reserves.  Countries not eligible under the Vulnerability FLEX will also benefit from other measures proposed by the Commission in its April communication, for example, reallocations following ad hoc country reviews and the advanced midterm review, support under the traditional FLEX, frontloading where feasible, etc.  Concerning the targeting of the budget support, I am convinced that the flexibility inherent in this instrument already allows recipient countries to use the funds in the manner which they judge will best help them respond to economic and social problems.  In addition, the advanced midterm review of the  10 th EDF will provide a good opportunity to identify new needs and assess whether these would be better addressed through general or sectoral budget support.  The advanced mediumterm review will also provide an additional opportunity to look again at budget support profiles in each ACP country and consider amendments, reallocation or additional funds from the reserve.  Concerning the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, our role in promoting their reform is, of course, limited. The issue of voice and representation will be discussed at the IMF World Bank annual meetings in Istanbul, which Commissioner Almunia and I will attend this October. In this respect, we welcome the addition of a third seat for subSaharan African countries on the World Banks Board of Governors, and are looking with interest at proposals on the table for further reforms.  Concerning illicit financial flows, I would like to reassure Mrs Joly that I have already given instructions to the Commission services to explore ways of improving fiscal and financial governance in developing countries in order to curb illicit financial flows. This crisis has also shown that we have to strengthen the mechanisms for delivering ODA.  The international aid effectiveness agenda embodied in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action is now more important than ever. In these difficult economic times, we have a particular responsibility towards the worlds poor to make sure our development assistance is being channelled effectively.  In its  8  April communication, the Commission also underlined the useful contribution of innovative funding mechanisms as a complementary and mutually reinforcing instrument with ODA. We have urged Member States to use their full tool kit and to leverage nonODA with ODA, for example, by building on ongoing voluntary solidarity levies such as the airline ticket taxes to finance health programmes. There will be highlevel discussions on this subject, including a major conference in  2010  organised by the French, which will involve the Commission upstream.
3526460 author: Lynne Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, yes, a crisis has hit the poorest countries the hardest and there is in fact not much that we can do about it. We can only talk about the remedies to get them back on track, and obviously this will take more time than it will take in the developed world because the mechanisms to produce new economic growth are much less developed in those countries.  One of the remarks that have been made by several members is about the fact that a lot of Member States are in fact backtracking on their Official Development Assistance (ODA) engagements. The EU Member States agreed in  2005  individual minimum aid targets of  0 . 51  for EU 15  and  0 . 17  for EU 12 , for the new Member States to be reached by  2010  and respectively  0 . 7  and  0 . 33  by  2015 .  The countries that had already achieved aid levels higher than these targets promised to maintain. Based on these confirmations and higher national pledges of some Member States, the EU should collectively reach  0 . 56  of ODA by  2010 .  I believe that the crisis should not be an excuse to water down donors aid promises, and I will insist on remaining committed to delivering the promised aid levels, both for EU Member States as well as other donors.  In  2008 , the EU ODA has increased by around EUR  4  billion to a level of  0 . 40  of ODA and the collective EU ODA is forecast to continue increasing.  On the basis of the information gathered from Member States, we foresee the EU collective ODA increasing to EUR  53 . 4  billion in  2009 , which represents  0 . 44 , and EUR  58 . 7  billion, representing  0 . 48 , in  2010 .  This also means that, without additional steps by Member States to fulfil their individual targets, the collective targets for  2010  will not be achieved. The forecasted trend of a continuing increase in EU ODA relies on those Member States that are trying to respect their commitments, but efforts are required by all Member States, and I will continue to insist on that with the respective Member Sates. It is their responsibility. This is an engagement that they have taken up, and the crisis should not be an excuse to water down their engagements. I would even say, to the contrary.  Several Members have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institutions. This is a target that I can fully subscribe to. The G 20  has set out a precise timetable for governance reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions urging them to accelerate the implementation of their own plans for reform which predate the London Summit. Some deliverables are expected as early as April next year and I am confident that solutions can be found on outstanding issues.  Given the current momentum in IMF reform created by the G 20 , the Commission underlines the importance of advancing the second phase of reform at the World Bank with a view to concluding it by spring  2010 .  The London Summit of  2  April  2009  will go down in the history of the G 20  as one where development issues were handled in their own right and in the presence of developing countries representatives. In preparation for the next G 20 , these last months have seen intense activity by the institution tasked with following up.  In August, the IMF Board of Governors approved a USD  250  billion general allocation of IMF special drawing rights, of which USD  18  billion will go to low income countries, and the IMF will be called to account in Pittsburgh on other measures for low income countries. So this is, I think, a positive evolution.  Louis Michel, my predecessor, has also insisted on the flexibility, claiming that the budgetary support mechanism is the most flexible we have, and this is obviously true but, of course, this also means that we need a counterpart with the developing countries and we need to be in a position to have political dialogue with them and also monitoring mechanisms, so it presupposes a minimum cooperation on their behalf, but, once that is in place, I also believe that, especially, sectoral budgetary support is a very adequate procedure.  I do not quite understand why this resolution that has been introduced by the Committee on Development and refers to the G 20  meeting of Pittsburgh is not being voted on before the G 20  meeting. I do not grasp that. There will probably be one or another technical explanation for that but I think it gives the wrong signal from this newly elected Parliament that we are going to debate such a resolution after the G 20  meeting in Pittsburgh, which is due to happen, if I remember correctly, from  22  to  24  September, before our next meeting in Strasbourg in October.  This is not within my discretion but I must say that, together with Members who have advocated this, I very much deplore that we have not been able to vote upon this resolution during this partsession.
4051735 author: Mary Green:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Peterle for his excellent report, and also the resolution, which gives a very good analysis of the situation in Tajikistan and makes recommendations which I can support.  Since the EU Strategy for Central Asia was adopted in June  2007 , our relationships with all the countries of Central Asia have been deepening to our mutual benefit. The rhythm of contacts between us has gathered pace, and there is now a shared understanding of the benefits of greater cooperation on security matters, border management and controls, education, governance and energy diversification. The strategy is succeeding in forging a new kind of partnership with the five Central Asian republics.  Clearly, though, this overarching strategy is underpinned by individual and differentiated bilateral relations that reflect the varying aspirations and orientations of the countries concerned. As you all know, our cooperation with Tajikistan is currently still governed by the trade and cooperation agreement concluded with the USSR in  1989  and endorsed by Tajikistan in  1994 . This agreement does not fully reflect our ambitions under the Central Asia Strategy any more, nor does it serve to support the kind of relationship we now seek with Tajikistan.  Your assent to the new EUTajikistan Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which is before you for debate today, would therefore represent a major step forward, allowing us to widen and deepen our cooperation with this country.  Todays Tajikistan is confronted, as has been said already, by major economic and social challenges. It is important  and in Europeans own interests  that Tajikistan should succeed in tackling its difficulties. This is a country which shares a nearly  1   500  km border with Afghanistan, and which lies close to the Swat Valley in Pakistan. It is a territory vulnerable to spillover from these conflict areas and to infiltration by Islamic militants.  Tajikistan is also key to efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs to Europe from Afghanistan. Greater cooperation with the European Union can therefore play a part in helping to prevent the spread of instability.  A key element in Tajikistans vulnerabilities is its weak economy. The poorest of the Central Asian republics has been badly hit by a substantial decrease in prices for aluminium and cotton due to the global downturn. This, taken together with a  34  drop in remittances in the first half of  2009 , gives rise to concern that poverty levels may be rising, and that a precarious socioeconomic situation could provoke social unrest.  I believe that we are now on the right track with Tajikistan, supporting and encouraging indispensable reforms. This has also been the focus of EU Special Representative Morels frequent visits and of my own visit in spring  2008 . There is progress, but clearly more needs to be done. The Government has made it clear that, in addition to greater trade and cooperation, it is willing to implement measures to improve social welfare, health, education, tackle corruption and improve human rights.  It is to be welcomed that President Rahmon has created the post of an ombudsman. The ombudsman will be an important interlocutor for us in the next round of the EUTajikistan human rights dialogue that you mentioned, on  23  September. Judiciary reform is still making slow progress, but we hope the recommendations of a recent human rights civil society seminar in Dushanbe will be taken into account by the government, particularly in reform of the legal profession and the new criminal procedure code in Tajikistan.  I am, of course, very well aware of your concerns on democracy and human rights in Tajikistan and I can therefore assure you that the Commission will take these concerns fully into account in our dialogues with this country.  As to the economic reforms, we see progress, for example, on the drafting of a cotton debt resolution mechanism, which hopefully will pave the way for wider agricultural reforms and the implementation of Freedom to Farm, crucial to tackling poverty in the country.  The European Parliaments assent to the PCA today will help us to continue to work with Tajikistan on a whole range of political and economic reforms, with a special focus on democracy and human rights, and also to ensure their thorough implementation. The reform effort is already underpinned by a relatively large amount of bilateral assistance from the Commission. Indeed, it is EUR  66  million for the period  2007  to  2010  which will even rise to EUR  70  million over the three years  2011  and  2013 .  Our aid will focus on sector support for social protection and health, public finance management reform and technical assistance for private sector development. This process will be supported by our delegation in Dushanbe. It is my intention that, before the end of this year, our regionalised office there should become a fullyfledged delegation to encourage the reform process and facilitate full implementation of the PCA. In particular, I hope it will help us to maintain a thorough assessment of progress in the key areas I have mentioned which we will then measure against clear benchmarks.
5959509 author: Michael Whittacker:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Mr President, I am very grateful to be here today and to have the opportunity to address the European Parliament so soon after the positive result in the referendum in Ireland. I pay tribute to Brian Cowen and his associates; I also say to all of those who have been engaged in the campaign, whatever their party or background, who contributed to this successful outcome: thank you for all your efforts. This was a good decision for Ireland; it is a good decision for Europe.  I think that we can say that Europe has listened to the criticism; I know that the legal guarantees offered by the European Council were decisive in the referendum campaign. I can also say that the French and the Czech Presidencies made efforts that were crucial to find a way to meet the concerns of the Irish people. I think we should also say that it was very positive to have the very strong majority that was shown in the referendum, a convincing majority of  67 . 1  and with a high turnout, as high as  59 . So, all of this is very good news for Europe.  And, of course, I do not have to explain to this Parliament the need to put the Lisbon Treaty in place. It will allow you to be more democratic, to be more efficient, and to be more transparent. It will, in fact, increase the influence of the EU in the international arena and make us stronger in meeting global challenges, and I know that you in this Parliament will also be given a more significant role in the overall decisionmaking process. I welcome this development. Therefore, it is very important to put this Lisbon Treaty into force.  The European Council is united in its wish for the Treaty to enter into force by the end of this year and the end of the Swedish Presidency. With the number of countries that have ratified it  we are now at  24  with full ratification  country number  25  might actually be Poland, given the signals that we are now getting from the Polish President. I spoke on Saturday, after the referendum result from Ireland was known, with the Taoiseach Brian Cowen, who said they would need a couple of weeks to secure full parliamentary ratification, and therefore we can also say that country number  26  will finally be Ireland. That leaves us just the Czech Republic to have the full  27  ratifications. To that end, we have had a meeting with the three institutions here in Brussels today: the Presidency, the head of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, and the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek. The Czech Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, was also with us and we tried to asses this situation. You might know that  17  senators have appealed to the Constitutional Court in the Czech Republic with a complaint concerning the Lisbon Treaty, to see if it is in accordance with the Czech Constitution. Jan Fischer told us that this is an independent court which is now working quickly to take the decision whether or not to bring up this petition. We do not foresee today an exact date when they will give this decision, and we are, of course, awaiting that signal. We hope to see it in just a week or a couple of weeks. That is the message from the Czech Republic today: an independent court taking a decision in maybe a weeks time, or it may be two weeks before we know how they will proceed.  As President of the European Council, I am responsible for moving the work of the Union forward. I strongly feel that we have no time to lose. Therefore, I have decided that while awaiting the clarifications in the Czech Republic, firstly we will continue the preparations for the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and secondly, when there is clarity on when the Lisbon Treaty will come into force, when there is clarity, I will begin consultations on the nominations of the new President of the European Council and the High Representative and SecretaryGeneral of the Council. Preparing this will not only be a matter for the Presidency: this is a matter for three institutions at the same time. I will therefore say that it is very important for us to work closely and constructively together with the Commission and the European Parliament in this process. I will again renew my offer to this Parliament to cooperate when we are making our efforts to get the Lisbon Treaty finally in place.  Let us also remember that despite these institutional matters, this Swedish Presidency  and this autumn  is, of course, very much influenced by the need to move on climate change, the need to move on the financial crisis, the worry in Europe that we need a policy for job creation  a lot of important matters that need to be addressed. That sums up for us the need to be active, to put in place the Lisbon Treaty, as I have just said, and to stay active as a Presidency on these very important matters for our voters.
643316 author: Lynne Bauer:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, the Irish people took a very important and historic decision last weekend: a very important decision for Ireland; a very important decision for Europe. The Irish people, by a resounding majority, recognised the importance of the Lisbon Treaty, a Treaty that offers a more democratic and effective Europe, a Treaty that gives us the right platform to deliver the modern, successful European Union our citizens wish to see.  The Treaty now has the democratic endorsement of all  27  Member States. All the Member States of the European Union, by parliament or by popular vote, have approved the Treaty.  This is indeed a major achievement. It shows how the enlarged Europe is able to share a vision for our future and a determination to move forward. It was decided democratically. Now what we need is the ratification procedures to be concluded.  I am pleased to see that President Kaczyski of Poland will be signing very soon. As he has always said to me, he will be ready to do it when the Irish have voted yes. This is indeed very good news.  Of course, we have to see the completion of the process in the Czech Republic. We need to respect the constitutional proceedings in that country, as we have done in other countries, but once these procedures are concluded, I see no reason why proceedings cannot be concluded swiftly.  This is important for Europe as a whole, but it is particularly important for the Commission. I want to see the new Commission in place, a Commission in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, and I want to see it in office as quickly as possible. A long period with a caretaker Commission is in nobodys interest. I am ready to start the formation of the next Commission as soon as the Council is ready to clarify the legal basis definitively, and also to nominate the High Representative who will become VicePresident of the Commission.  I appreciate all the efforts made by the Swedish Presidency, and personally by Prime Minister Reinfeldt, to reach a swift conclusion to all these processes. The initiative that Prime Minister Reinfeldt took today at a meeting with me and with you, President Buzek, and the video conference with Prime Minister Fischer, was a very good and useful initiative.  I also know that this Parliament has worked tirelessly to promote the Lisbon Treaty. Parliament and Commission have worked hand in hand to explain why it is the right treaty for Europe. I am proud of the role that the Commission played in giving the Irish people the information they needed to make up their minds.  Now that we have a real probability of having the Lisbon Treaty finally ratified and the whole process completed, we can turn our attention to the work to implement the Treaty. I would like to take this occasion to highlight four areas where we are working hard to ensure that we can hit the ground running when the Treaty comes into force.  One of the most important and the most complex has to be the innovations regarding the European External Action Service. We have been working hard to think through some of the practical details of how we can make the European External Action Service a real success. This work will now accelerate and, in the same spirit as the remarks made just now by the Swedish Presidency, I want to state the European Commissions determination to work with Parliament to achieve that objective.  I know that Elmar Brok has been leading on this subject here in Parliament. I understand that you will debate this at the next plenary. This is excellent timing since this will take place shortly before the same question is discussed at the European Council. I think that report is an excellent basis for discussions between our institutions, and I welcome the strong Community spirit that inspires the report. This is exactly the spirit that I will uphold in the preparation for the important innovation that is the European External Service.  Another point is comitology. It is an important aspect of how the European Union does its business. The Treaty of Lisbon introduces new rules making the system more rational and transparent. We need to fix exactly how the new system should work. But let me be clear: many of these decisions are of great political importance and deserve proper democratic scrutiny and real political ownership. So we need to maintain the strong role played by Parliament today.  Another important democratic element is the new mechanisms to allow national parliaments a direct say on subsidiarity. We need to put these mechanisms in the broader context of the excellent relations with national parliaments built up by the Commission, and indeed the European Parliament, over the last few years.  Finally, I would like to mention the European Citizens Initiative. This is one of the most striking innovations on the Treatys democratic agenda and one on which this Parliament has already worked in detail. Margot Wallstrm has been leading our work in developing a green paper to launch a consultation as soon as possible, with the goal of seeing this opportunity in citizens hands within a year of entry into force.  When I spoke to this Parliament last month, I set out what I saw as the greatest challenges and the great opportunities facing Europe today. With the Lisbon Treaty, we will have the right springboard to help us make those goals a reality, and I am sure that with this constructive partnership between our institutions, we will make it a success. That is the commitment of the European Commission.
1703466 author: Nancy White:  on behalf of the ALDE Group.  Mr President, last Friday was a really historic step:  67  of the votes. You can change all the constitutions in Europe with a twothirds majority; I think a twothirds majority is also necessary in Sweden.  We have to thank Brian Cowen. I also especially thank Pat Cox, who did a great job, and all proLisbon Irish MEPs because they conducted a tremendous campaign in favour of the Treaty. So I am happy. The reason is that we started this whole exercise in the aftermath of the Nice Treaty, with a declaration in Laeken, and it has taken eight years  so I promise not to restart this whole process, Mr President.  With this Irish yes, all the citizens of Europe, directly or indirectly, by a referendum or by their parliaments, have said yes to the Lisbon Treaty. That was also a message to the Eurosceptics who were always saying no  the people are against Europe, against the European institutions. Sixtyseven per cent of the Irish population: what we saw on Friday is a clear message to the Eurosceptics.  We have to ask everyone to take his or her responsibility so the Lisbon Treaty can enter into force as quickly as possible. Now is the time to bring this process finally to an end. With this Irish yes, we know that the Lisbon Treaty will be brought into effect; we know that, because it was the last hurdle. However, we do not know when it will come into effect, and I think that is the problem we have to discuss this afternoon. What do we do in the meantime?  We know that we have to wait until the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic has spoken. As you said yesterday in Le Monde, in the worst case scenario, we still have a few months to wait and I think that nobody in this House can tolerate the fact that the Union will be a lame duck in the months to come. We can accept that the Commission will be dealing with current affairs because after  31  October, it should be dealing with current affairs. We need action and we need action urgently. Therefore, Mr Reinfeldt, President of the Council, my invitation to you is to initiate, as fast as possible, the procedure for the nomination of the Commission.  Three weeks ago, we voted for the President of the Commission with the argument that the current crisis does not allow us to postpone a decision. That was your argument. So the same argument applies now to the nomination of the Commission. It is not necessary to wait: a new Commission is possible with the present treaty, with the present status for the High Representative and then, once the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, you can smoothly install a High Representative with another statute and a President of the Council. There is really no reason to wait to proceed with the Commission.  This was also the aim of the President of the Commission if I understood him correctly when he spoke a few minutes ago. I fear that I hear you saying No, I am waiting; I am waiting because I want a global package, a global package including the President of the Council. I say that is not a problem: prepare your global package. Prepare it now, and the decision on the Council President can be as political as the decision that you took on Mr Barroso the first time. You presented him as a candidate by a political decision, not a formal decision, because we asked to formalise it afterwards. You can do exactly the same with the President of the Council and then, once the Treaty is ratified, you can formalise the whole package. Then you change the statute of the High Representative: he becomes VicePresident of the Commission. At the same time, the political decision that you take on the President of the Council now can be put into practice; you can then formalise it.  That is the best way, the best pressure that you can put on those other countries that have to sign: formalise it, because they know that we want to go forward. And we still do not have to wait for several weeks and months. In any case, you have said that there is no time to waste. I agree with you: there is no time to waste with this current economic and financial crisis.  Put the Commission together now, as fast as possible. Convince your colleagues in the Council and take your decision on the High Representative on the basis of the present Treaty. Pick one of the candidates  I have seen there are enough candidates  for the President of the Council and go forward with it.
6575844 author: Marc Corless:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, I will just make some comments on the comments made by the group leaders, and I thank all of them for their contributions. These institutional issues of transitions between two treaties are very difficult from a legal and political point of view, and they require wisdom from all institutions. Of course, we would like to have the new Treaty approved as soon as possible. The majority of Members of this Parliament want it, all the governments want it, and the Commission certainly wants it.  The point is, as the Prime Minister has just pointed out, that the Treaty will not be approved before the end of the mandate of this Commission. The Commissions mandate lasts until the end of this month, so we will inevitably have a period where the Commission is a caretaker Commission. That is why I think Parliament took the right decision some time ago in already deciding on the President of the Commission, because that gives the President of the Commission the authority, the political authority, to represent the Commission in very important international obligations. That was a wise decision of the European Parliament.  The important point now is to see how to deal with this transition. Today we have discussed this in the Commission, and our opinion in the College is that we should, if possible, already bring in the new Commission under the Lisbon Treaty. That is our opinion because this is the Treaty we want; this is the Treaty which gives you, Parliament, more rights in terms of the formation of the Commission itself. For instance, the High Representative will be VicePresident of the Commission, and so you will vote on the High Representative. That will not happen if we implement the Nice Treaty, and so it is our opinion that we should, if possible, bring in the new Commission under the Lisbon rules. But that, of course, is a question of wisdom and of timing as well. We have, in the past, namely in the first Commission that I took part in, also started with a prolongation of the previous Commission for three weeks.  So the question is: how long does it take? And that is why I stated very quickly  and Prime Minister Reinfeldt knows what I think about it  that it is one thing to wait for some weeks and another thing to be waiting we do not know until when. That is a question of judgment, political judgment, and I hope the European Council will take the right decisions based on the information we get from our Czech partners. This is the question which has to be decided in the European Council at the end of this month.  Certainly we do not want  I think it is in nobodys interests  to have a Commission that is without full legal competences. It is not in the interests of the Commission and I am sure it is also not in the interests of the European Parliament. That is why I have said I am ready: I am ready to start the formation of the new Commission as soon as we have the legal clarity and the European Council starts the process. For that, I need the Council to take some decisions. I need the European Council to propose a High Representative because the High Representative, according to the Lisbon Treaty, has to be approved by the President of the Commission as VicePresident of the Commission.  Regarding some comments, I want to underline certain points, and to reassure some Members of Parliament. Some of you said that there will be a President of Europe. I am sorry: there will not be a President of Europe. If we have the Lisbon Treaty, there will be a President of the European Council: it is different. There is a President of Parliament, there is a President of the Commission, and there will be a President of the European Council. It is important to underline that point because sometimes, I think there are ideas about certain drives institutionnelles, and I will not accept, and the European Commission will not accept, the idea that the President of the European Council is the President of Europe, because it is not in the Treaties.  (Applause)  It is not in the Treaties and we will have to respect the Treaties. We have to respect the institutions. There is a President of the European Parliament; there is President of the Commission. If we have Lisbon, there will be a President of the European Council.  It is very important to understand that all our decisions have to be taken in the framework of the current treaties. That is why I now believe that, as soon as the Czechs verify their situation, we should move forward. That is why I think we should work on those points I made before, from the Citizens Initiative to the External Services, with that spirit of cooperation between all institutions so that, when the decisions are formally taken, we can implement with determination everything that the Lisbon Treaty brings, which I believe is more accountability, more democracy and more efficiency for our Union.
8787870 author: Annette White:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, it has been an interesting debate, which I am sure, to some extent, repeats the discussions that have been held in Ireland and elsewhere.  Could I just start with some facts. It is the Member States governments who decide on the method for ratification. There is no way that the EU institutions can force a Member State to choose either a referendum or a parliamentary ratification. I think it is very important to say this. It is interesting that those who speak very strongly in favour of independent nation states are also the ones who would be willing to impose a referendum on all other Member States, which I find a bit strange.  Now Ireland decided to carry out a second referendum. Let us be very honest; this always carries a political risk, but it was the Irish Government which decided that they were willing to do so. And why did they do that?  Incidentally, it is not unusual to repeat referenda: that has been done previously on domestic issues, and in certain Member States you can come back several times on a domestic issue too, so let us be intellectually honest about this whole procedure.  I think we have heard a very good analysis from the Irish MEPs themselves, from Mr Kelly, from Mary MacDonald, from Mr De Rossa: they offered an explanation on why there was a change among the Irish population, on why they moved towards a yes vote, and I think we have had good answers.  I think some MEPs have a very strange way of looking at democracy as very static and absolute. They maybe prefer to forget that this is a discussion about a reform. It is a process that started in Laeken many years ago and has involved different democratic bodies and discussions over the years to try to find a common way of taking decisions in a more modern, more democratic and efficient way. Member States and their leaders have, of course, invested a lot of time and energy in this procedure and this is why it is not static: it cannot be compared with a football match. I am sorry, you cannot count scores in the same way as in a football match, because we also have to listen to each other.  And this is what was done. The concerns of the Irish people were listened to and they did it themselves in Ireland. Why do we have to explain? The Irish themselves, their national parliament, debated in a subcommittee the reasons why there was a no vote  because this came as a surprise to many there. So they looked at the reasons.  I was there myself. I was at the fashion fair in Dublin, I was at the fish market in Cork, I was at the public meeting in Donegal, and what many people said first of all was: Well, we have not actually read the full text of the Treaty, it is a very complex legal text and it is difficult to understand exactly what this is all about.  Some said they were very afraid that what was on the posters might be true, that the EU will decide on a minimum wage which is EUR  1 . 48 : can that really be true? Or is it true that the EU will impose conscription to a European army and send very young people to Afghanistan in a European army: can this be true? What kind of statements are these? Should I believe in them? So there were a lot of worries and a lot of real concerns and mainly, I would say, a lack of information and a need for their concerns to be taken seriously.  This is what happened. Civil society also engaged, as I think Mr Kelly explained very well. I am not ashamed of the fact that we made a citizens summary of the Lisbon Treaty which was then published in the big newspapers  uncontested by anybody I may add  so that citizens could themselves read a summary in understandable language of the full Treaty, so that they could judge by themselves what was in there, what was true or not.  I think the legal guarantees helped, because then it was clarified that they did not have to worry about neutrality or abortion or any of the other concerns. So this was clarified and they got legal guarantees and they got a Commissioner  and thank you, Ireland, because it means that there will be a Swedish Commissioner also from now on, also a German one, and one from Greece etc., so I think we also have to thank the Irish for setting that straight.  Of course, we do not debate these things in a political vacuum. The reality will also influence how we think about these issues, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I think we should always, in the analysis that follows after a referendum, think very carefully about any fear factors on both sides, because fear is a very strong emotion and it might be misused. So I think that the debate that will follow in Ireland should also address how to avoid using or misusing any fear factor. But the reality showed that the Irish people believe that they have a place in the centre of Europe, and that they will be helped by belonging fully to Europe and not being questioned about whether this is true or not.  I also hope that the Commission can continue to play this role of providing factual objective information, but the debate will go on because, remember, the upside of a referendum is that you have to engage with citizens. You have to provide information and a debate and a discussion. The downside is that it also divides the population. You are forced to say yes or no and that can stay for a long time in the hearts and minds of the Irish as well. We have a duty, an obligation democratically, to also take the concerns of the no side seriously, to continue the debate and make sure that the EU issues are integrated into the normal political debate, including by civil society in Ireland from now on, and in the rest of Europe in the same way. This is part of the reason why we did not have a higher voter turnout: that it is not part of the daily discussions about politics in each and every Member State.  That has to be done and I hope that there will be a Commissioner responsible for both citizenship and communication from now on, and hopefully under the new Lisbon Treaty.
4402004 author: Katarina Finlayson:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Mr President, we move from one item to the next. This is a very serious and important subject which the honourable Members have raised and chosen to put on the agenda.  On Monday,  28  September, more than  100  people were killed in Conakry, Guinea, when members of the Guinean security forces shot into crowds of demonstrators. Guinean citizens had gathered in a stadium in the capital to demonstrate against the presumed intention of the Guinean military interim leader, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, to run for President. The final death toll is still unknown, as the soldiers also collected the bodies rather than allow them to be counted at public morgues. At this stage, we do not know the real dimension of these tragic events. The number of injured people is said to be at least  1   200 , and eye witnesses have reported that soldiers raped women on the streets of Conakry.  During the violent repression, several opposition leaders were wounded and temporarily arrested. The number of protestors still under detention is also unknown; the houses of opposition leaders were ransacked and shops looted by uniformed men. In a TV statement the following day, Captain Camara expressed his condolences with the families of those killed and visited some of the injured. He proclaimed two days of national mourning and pledged to investigate the violence. He distanced himself from the killings by saying that he was not in control of the elements of the military responsible for the atrocities.  The European Union immediately and forcefully condemned these brutal and shocking events. A Presidency declaration, a statement by High Representative Solana and a statement by EU Commissioner De Gucht were issued the following day. We will have to insist on the liberation of the arrested prisoners and a thorough investigation of the events.  The violence in Guinea received worldwide condemnation. The UN Security Council was briefed last Wednesday on the situation in the country. The African Union condemned the events and decided to prepare a report on possible measures to be taken. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called for a full international inquiry into the matter. Parliament, as you know, condemned the unconstitutional change of power, and in its resolution of  15  January  2009 , called for respect for human rights and a rapid return to constitutional order. The EU decided to open consultations under Article  96  of the Cotonou Agreement, and EU development aid  apart from humanitarian aid and support for democratic transition  was frozen.  We have not been alone. Our international partners have acted in line with us. The African Union and ECOWAS decided to suspend Guinea until it established a democratically elected parliament or government. An international contact group on Guinea cochaired by the African Union and ECOWAS, and with participation by the European Union, was put into place. In March, the military junta agreed with the opposition to have elections before the end of  2009 , which gave reasonable hope for a peaceful and democratic transition. Captain Camara gave his assurances that none of the coup leaders would stand for political office. A national transitional council was to guide the transition process and prepare the necessary modification of the constitution in order to help elections.  What can we do, then, to prevent further violence, and how can we help the people of Guinea in their legitimate desire for democracy, the rule of law, peace and development? Well, there are three main areas of action. First of all, we should maintain and reinforce political pressure on the regime in Conakry, notably in the context of the international group. Captain Camaras decision not to run could allow calm to return. The nomination of the President of Burkina Faso, Mr Blaise Compaor, as facilitator in the crisis on behalf of ECOWAS and the International Contact Group, is a very positive sign, and the European Union has welcomed this appointment via the Presidency. We hope that his mediation will contribute to a secure, peaceful and lasting solution to the situation in Guinea.  Secondly, the option of targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for violence could be further explored. We will need to coordinate this approach with the African Union and other international and bilateral partners. The upcoming EUAfrican Ministerial Troika in Addis Ababa and the meeting on Guinea on  12  October in Abuja will be important in this respect.  Thirdly, we should continue to provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population and support the democratic transition process. The latter will nevertheless depend on the credible willingness of the transitional authorities of Guinea to reengage in a peaceful and constructive dialogue with a clear commitment to refraining from further violence and to respecting the human rights and political freedoms of its citizens. We will spare no efforts to help the people of Guinea in this critical moment and we are determined to support a return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections. We encourage all stakeholders in Guinea to refrain from violence and to make a peaceful and democratic transition.
824044 author: Helen Reid:  rapporteur.  Madam President, the positive result of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty brings us one step closer to that moment in time when the European Parliament will not only be consulted by the Council, but will have codecision powers on matters which are now under the third pillar.  The question then is: why is the Council so keen to adopt legislation a few months before that date when, moreover, that legislation does not represent a step forward in establishing a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice? The truth is that this proposal does not help prevent any conflicts of jurisdiction, and does not provide for any settlement when such situations arise. This could be done, for example, by reducing multiple jurisdiction and by allocating jurisdiction to Member States, as was done through various regulations on civil law, with the obligation to mutually recognise the decisions that followed from that allocation of jurisdiction. Instead, this Framework Decision is limited to a duty of Member States to inform one another and to enter into direct consultation in order to reach consensus on any effective solution aimed at avoiding the adverse consequences arriving from parallel proceedings.  That is why I was not surprised when, during the exchange of views in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs a few weeks ago, the Commission  although supporting the current proposal  mentioned it would come up with a new proposal at a later stage. That is also why I am not surprised by what the Commissioner has said this evening. I thank the Commission for being so honest about the proposal, but have to say that I consider this proposal and the entire procedure for its adoption a good example of how we should not legislate within the European Union. I strongly believe that what is important is to protect our citizens rights and not just to tick boxes. By the way, the Council is not present today, although the Presidency was one of the initiators of the proposal. I have to stress that within the European Parliament, we took our work very seriously. We worked in good faith during the last mandate and this one, and would hope to be sending a message on our views on having more effective legislation.  What I welcome about this proposal is that the current text explicitly refers to the principle of ne bis in idem. This was due to the exchange of views we had with the Council and the Commission, as the original text proposed did not mention it at all. The report I drafted pays particular attention to three aspects.  Firstly, I believe that the protection of persons formally charged must receive the highest attention and consistent procedural safeguards have to be provided for. These should include the right of the formally charged person to receive enough information for him or her to have a basis upon which to challenge any solution which does not appear to be reasonable. Secondly, with regard to the details concerning the person formally charged, which national authorities exchange through the notifications, I support the idea that it is important to ensure an adequate level of data protection and that it should be specified in this Framework Decision what kind of personal data is exchanged.  Last but not least, I strongly believe that the involvement of Eurojust in the decision on the choice of jurisdiction is of the utmost importance. In my opinion, Eurojust should be involved from the earliest stage because of its coordinating role and because of its more and more relevant tasks. I am among those who consider that we created this Agency not only to show that we are concerned with combating transborder crime, but because we need strong instruments. Eurojust has already proved in the years since its establishment that it deserves our trust. That is why I am surprised by the reluctance shown by the Council and by some colleagues in the European Parliament. Having said that, I would like to call on the European Commission to present at the earliest opportunity a proposal completing this Framework Decision on the conflicts of jurisdiction. I will finish by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the way they worked on this report.
306010 author: Annette MacLeod:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, freedom of expression and freedom of information represent a foundation of a free, democratic and pluralistic society. That is my firm belief as a former journalist and it is also the firm belief of the European Union. That is why all the EU institutions  Parliament, the Council and the Commission  have signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article  11  of which states that: Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.  I would like to recall that the EU Charter also states, in Article  51 ( 1 ), where and when those fundamental rights apply. I quote again: The provisions of this charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States, but only when they are implementing Union law.  Within the EUs sphere of competence, which we have to respect, the European Commission has always stood up for freedom of the media, freedom of expression, freedom of information and freedom of the press, whether within the EU or in our external relations with third countries. I recall, in particular, the important role played by the EUs Television without Frontiers Directive which, since  1989 , has made sure that citizens in all EU Member States are free to receive, without restrictions, broadcasts from other EU countries; an EU directive which has substantially contributed to the free flow of information across borders and to a more pluralistic media landscape in all Member States. In this context, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having helped the Commission to get a modernised version of this directive which extends the freedom of information across borders, beyond broadcasting, to other audiovisual services and, particularly, those transmitted by Internet.  This directive needs to be implemented by all EU Member States by the end of the year and will make important contributions to a pluralistic landscape when it also comes to the online environment. Let me also recall three other very important elements of this directive.  Firstly, the promotion of independent TV productions. There is a rule in the directive that broadcasters need to reserve at least  10  of their transmission time or  10  of their programming budget to European works created by producers who are independent from the broadcasters.  Secondly, the directive foresees in its modernised version the right of journalists and news organisations to access short extracts across the EU for the purpose of short reporting.  Thirdly, and this is of utmost importance, there is a reference in the new directive to the need to have independent media authorities at national level. This is a reference which was proposed by the Commission and which could only be adopted in the end thanks to strong support by the European Parliament. Thus, for the broadcasting sector, the modernised Television Without Frontiers Directive can be seen as a charter for freedom of crossborder information in the EU.  Now let me recall another important aspect in the EUs field of competence where this institution can act and has acted for the benefit of media pluralism. I mean radio spectrum policy. You all know that there cannot be broadcasting without access to radio spectrum, and it is the EU policy to ensure that all players on the market get nondiscriminatory access to radio spectrum. National authorities are thus not entitled to freeze, by means of spectrum allocation, the competitive situation on the media market for the benefit of the operators already active on that market. The European Court of Justice, by the way, has confirmed this important principle, which directly results from the freedom to provide services, in its Centro Europa judgment. The Commission welcomed that ruling as a contribution to fair competition and as an important foundation for strengthening media pluralism. On that basis, the Commission has repeatedly acted against Member States where the system of spectrum management has appeared to be in contradiction with this principle.  By way of example, I would like to recall the  2006  infringement proceedings on radio spectrum allocation in Italy, which my colleague Neelie Kroes and I opened. Under the pressure of this procedure, the Italian authorities are now changing their approach. The result of this will be a substantial market opening and a win for media pluralism. Spectrum policy is therefore a clear example of an area where the EU can act within its field of competences in order to enhance competition for the resources on which broadcasters depend, and thereby strengthen media pluralism.  Concerning the written press, the competences of the EU are substantially more limited. The written press is one of those prime examples of national, or even regional, competences and its situation very often reflects the varying cultural traditions in our different Member States. There is thus no EU legislation specifically on the written press, nor can there be legislation under the treaties as they stand. Nevertheless, in the EU institutions and, in particular, the European Commission, we have always flanked the development of the written press across the EU. I recall that in my capacity as EU Media Commissioner, I had numerous meetings with editorsinchief from all around Europe to discuss the current issues relating to media freedom and media pluralism.  In June  2009 , this led to the European Charter on Freedom of the Press, drafted by journalists across Europe. I fully endorsed that charter when the final outcome of this work was handed over to me. The Charter on the Freedom of the Press initiated by the European journalist community is an important reaffirmation of the basic values enshrined in fundamental legal texts such as the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is also a reminder for all policymakers in their field of competence that, in order to have effective freedom of the press, public authorities do indeed have a role to play: they must be ready to protect freedom of expression and foster its development. The charter is therefore an important step towards reinforcing these basic values and rights, allowing journalists to invoke them against governments or against political public authorities whenever they feel that the freedom of their work is unjustifiably threatened.  The honourable Members will see that strong political commitment is being shown by the EUs institutions, and particularly by the Commission, to fundamental rights and freedom of information, of expression and of the media. We are using our competences to uphold those rights and freedoms in our work, on the basis of the Treaties, and will continue to do so.  However, let me also touch on another important aspect, namely the fact that fundamental rights apply to EU policies does not make the EU competent for all matters relating to fundamental rights in one Member State or another. Let us not forget that the Member States have constitutions, many of them with long traditions, and that in all Member States, there are courts, appeal courts and constitutional courts which ensure that fundamental rights are respected and enforced whenever national authorities act. We had an example of this as recently as yesterday in Italy.  This is the result of the fact that we have a division of labour, because Europe is not a superstate, but is comprised of  27  sovereign Member States and will continue to operate like this under the new Lisbon Treaty too.  I would therefore call on you not to make use of the EU institutions to solve problems which should, under our Treaties, be solved at national level. We should not claim a role that we do not have, and we will not have it under the Lisbon Treaty either. Let us concentrate here on applying effectively the rules, principles, rights and freedoms in areas where the EU is competent. This can lead to very important progress, and I have mentioned several concrete examples of this in my speech.  Let me add another example of where we could act. Paul Rbig, a Member of this House, recently proposed in a budgetary amendment a new EU programme called Erasmus for Journalists. Such a programme would, in difficult times for the written press, allow journalists to work for a limited time with editorial staff in other Member States. It would also allow journalists to discover the political, economic and social situation in other Member States and to write about it. It would allow journalists to compare the situation across Europe and to present that to the readers, including the situation with regard to freedom of the press. That is why I encourage the European Parliament to look very favourably on these proposals, which certainly have the support of the EU Media Commissioner.
3545988 author: James Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I think that this debate was very important because it made very clear that there is a strong agreement in this House, a strong agreement that the freedom of the press does not have an if or a when, it is the basis of our European Union. We have to defend it, it is a fundamental value, we have to speak up when it is not honoured and we have to act if there is a problem to be solved.  (The President requested silence in the Chamber)  There is also an agreement in this House that the freedom of the media is a problem to be looked at in all Member States. Many of you have not been in this House before so I will just recall the action of the European journalists to set up a European Charter on Freedom of the Press. That was drawn up in order to help mainly the journalists in the new Member States and they had asked for this help from the journalistic community.  I just want to recall this, because it has been said in this House that there are problems with public television in many of our Member States. I recall having gone to one of those Member States  it was Hungary  to reinforce the case for saving public television, and I think that that should be done in all Member States when there is a problem.  It is for this reason that we have voted in the new Television Without Frontiers Directive, with the help of the Parliament, for the establishment of independent media authorities in all of our Member States. I can assure this House that whenever there is a problem in establishing these independent media authorities, the Commission will act.  Now where there is a disagreement in this House is on how to bring together EU competences with media policies. I think that many Members did not hear my introductory statements where I quoted from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is very clear. I also quoted Article  51 ( 1 ) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also states very clearly when the charter is to be implemented and the rules for implementing the charter. So I think that everybody can read this and recall it.  Unfortunately, nobody is listening now, although this is very important.  (The President again requested silence)  In my introductory speech, I also underlined the very clear actions, the concrete examples of where the EU can act and has acted, and I underlined the problems which have to be solved at national level. The constitutional court of Italy, which acted yesterday, has clearly shown what that means.  Now there have been several clear demands by this House and I would like to reply to these if the House would permit and listen.  (The President once more requested silence)  There is the demand by this House to go for the media pluralism approach which has been promised. The work on media pluralism has already made substantial progress and we have published the second step with the risk indicators on media pluralism. Maybe many parliamentarians have not seen these. They are on the Internet; they can be looked at and they are a very important element in being able to conduct this objective work on media pluralism which Parliament has called for.  I must say that I was very disappointed because we had a public workshop on this and not a single parliamentarian turned up to participate in the workshop. Well, the risk indicators have been published now and they can be looked at. They will be the basis for our future work.  Second question: why does the Commission not activate Article  7  of the EU Treaty in the case of Italy? First of all, Article  7  is a very exceptional provision. So far, it has never been activated by the EU institutions. This clause would apply only if there were a complete breakdown of national jurisdictional orders and fundamental rights systems in a given Member State. I do not think that we have reached such a situation in any of our Member States. But  and it is very interesting  the article states that the European Parliament itself has the possibility to activate Article  7  of the EU Treaty. So I call on the European Parliament, if it really thinks there is sufficient proof, to activate Article  7  of the EU Treaty.  Third question: many parliamentarians from all political parties  and I think there is relative unanimity in this House  have asked for an EU directive on media pluralism and media concentration.  (The President once more requested silence)  This is a fundamental question that has to be discussed in depth. You might recall that the European Commission started to work on the draft for such a directive in the  1990 s and you will also recall that all Member States, without exception, were against such a directive at that time because it was considered to be outside the competences of the EU.  Now, maybe the situation has changed today and there will be a large majority of Member States thinking this can enter into the competences of the EU. Of course, it would be possible to arrive at such a very generous interpretation of the Treaty, to allow the EU to tackle the matter. But, before even starting to think about this, the Commission would need to have the strong support of the whole European Parliament. And I would like the European Parliament to identify clearly which internal market problems it wants to be tackled with such a directive.  You know that I personally am not the kind of Commissioner who has a problem in regulating. I have, in the last five years, regulated when it was necessary. But to do this we need clear evidence about the questions we want to answer. Would legislation solve the problems you all have in mind today? Could we justify it under existing EU competences? Is there a clear crossborder dimension? Is there a clear internal market dimension because  remember  the legislation which we have already put on the table was all on the internal market legal basis.  All this would need to be clarified before we could start a legislative process. So I invite Parliament to discuss this seriously and I invite Parliament to respond to this question in an owninitiative report adopted by a majority of Members. Then the Commission will take that a step forward.  In the meantime, the Commission has done its homework by establishing the risk indicators that will help us to analyse this whole problem in all Member States on an objective basis. I think, in the end, that is what the Parliament wants. That is also what the other institution wants, because we do not want political usage of our basic freedoms. We want these freedoms to be a right; we want these freedoms to be a basic value and to be treated as such.  (Applause)
6076155 author: Roger Finlayson:  on behalf of the ALDE Group.  Mr President, our colleague, Mr Coelho, has yet again justified his middle name: Carlos Schengen Coelho. He is our resident expert on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and we are very grateful for his work and his expertise. He has done very good forensic reports on these proposals and they highlight what an awful muddle the European Union is in regarding monitoring and evaluation.  It certainly makes no sense to me that fitness to join the Schengen zone should lie exclusively in the hands of the Member States in any case, irrespective of any arcane split between pre and postSchengen accession. We are told in the Commission proposal for the regulation that as evaluation before putting into effect is fundamental for Member States in order to gain mutual trust, it seems reasonable for this to remain the responsibility of Member States. But we do not leave it to Member States to evaluate the Balkan countries, for which this evening the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will vote on their fitness for visa waiver, for visafree travel  it is the Commission which does the assessment and evaluation, so there is no consistency at all in saying that it should be in the hands of the Member States to judge other states.  To be honest, I do not grasp this peculiar split between evaluation of putting into effect measures necessary to join Schengen which, according to the Commission, has to remain intergovernmental, and checking the implementation of the Schengen acquis. Certainly, it appears that the Member States do not do a very good job because we learn from the proposal for a decision that in recent years, Member States have not seen the need to carry out evaluations on the spot concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters and drugs. Data protection has also not always been subject to onsite evaluations. I think there are many people not only in this House but beyond who would think that issues to do with criminal cooperation, drugs, tackling drug smuggling and protection of privacy are rather important matters to have onthespot inspections about. So I entirely support the conclusions of Carlos Coelho that we need to bring all this together, to have a consolidation of the procedures by which this evaluation is done, to consolidate the task between the first and the third pillar  and I hope that soon the phrase third pillar will be consigned to history and I never have to say it again  to have one simple, effective, efficient and transparent evaluation and to ensure that the transparency includes accountability to the European Parliament.  It is most strange that at this juncture, on the eve of what I am now convinced will be the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty  and I did my bit in the UK House of Lords last year, by the way  the Commission should put forward this extremely muddled and senseless set of proposals. I support the rejection and I request the Commission to come back with a better proposal that takes account of the Lisbon Treaty, takes account of codecision, takes account of simplicity and effectiveness in monitoring and is consistent with the Commissions and Parliaments responsibilities in other areas.  It begs the whole question of the way peer review is done in this European Union of the  27  Member States. As I say, that bears looking at, including in the human rights area, because we do not seem to have any clear principles and structures and simply adopt different things in different areas. Much as I love the Member States, I am afraid they often adopt a practice of Ill scratch your back and you scratch mine, which means they do not criticise each other, so actually they are not good people to evaluate each other. The Commission, when it works at its best, is the one to do it.  As I have a few seconds left, I would like to challenge Mr Bradbourn from the ECR Group on an issue of free movement. He called for a global ban on socalled naked body scanners. It would have helped if he had been at the vote last year when his colleagues opposed a ban on the use of these body scanners without a fundamental review of human rights. His colleagues voted against that ban. Mr Bradbourn was not even present at the vote, so it is a bit rich for him to go on about it now.
10354059 author: Lynne LaCourt:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, let me first of all thank you for giving me the opportunity to express the Commissions views on this sensitive issue.  You are already aware that there will be no ambitious deal in Copenhagen if the concerns of the developing countries are not taken into account, not only those of emerging countries, but also very much the concerns of the most vulnerable and the poorest developing countries.  Nevertheless, reaching a good deal in Copenhagen is in our common interest. Developing countries are the most vulnerable countries to climate change. The EU is the first donor in the world and a leader in the fight against climate change. We have to combine our efforts. There is no place for NorthSouth confrontation when you are dealing with climate change.  I would even go further and say that no other alliance can be as determining and effective as the one engaging the most vulnerable countries and the ones who have put on the negotiating table the most ambitious proposals to fight this plague  that is to say, Europe.  Our general approach towards the most vulnerable countries, followed up to now through the Global Climate Change Alliance, is made up of three parallel strands, which are interlinked and are mutually reinforcing.  First, building political alliances through reinforced dialogue on climate change. Three joint political declarations have been signed respectively with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, plus one with the ACP group as a whole.  Second, promoting sound policies and strategies linking climate change and development. I am of the opinion that climate resilience and lowcarbon policies must be integrated into wider developments and the poverty reduction strategies of our partners. There can only be a single development strategy, which incorporates climate concerns pursuing the objectives of sustainable development and poverty reduction. It is not a matter of choosing one or the other: both are essential.  In this spirit, we already support the implementation of the existing national adaptation programmes of action of LDCs in  15  eligible countries.  Third, encouraging adequate EU contribution to finance climate actions, in particular, for adaptation, which is the priority concern for those countries that are most vulnerable to climate change impact, but who barely contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.  We are only  50  days away from Copenhagen. Expectations are very high. And we are worried because the negotiations are dangerously close to deadlock at the moment. It is now the time for putting offers on the table. That is what Europe has done, and that is what we expect our partners to do as well.  Firstly, we have made offers in terms of commitments. The EU has already put on the table ambitious targets and commitments  so far, the second most ambitious on the table of negotiations. We have already guaranteed a unilateral  20  emission reduction by  2020 , and we are committed to increase to  30  if comparable efforts are made by others according to their responsibilities and capabilities.  Second, offers in terms of financing. We are all conscious that a deal on financing will be crucial to achieving an agreement in Copenhagen. To move forward in the negotiations, the EC issued in midSeptember its own proposals on finance.  One of them is the need for shortterm international public funding for climate to be scaled up for the period  20102012  to respond as a priority to urgent needs identified in the most vulnerable developing countries and, in particular, LDCs, SIDs, and African countries as defined in the Bali Action Plan.  Another one is the readiness of the EU to take on its fair share of the estimated financing requirements, public funding contributions being based on preferred criteria of ability to pay and responsibility for emissions. This may lead to an EU contribution between EUR  2  billion and EUR  15  billion annually in  2020 . These proposals will be discussed by the European Council at the end of October and will hopefully be the basis for a fullyfledged EU negotiation position on finance.  But action by the EU alone is not enough. We strongly hope that other developed countries will follow our paths as the pressure grows before Copenhagen. We count on developing countries as well. They have to take the opportunity offered by climate financing to fully integrate adaptation into their development strategies and to move gradually to lowcarbon development paths for the longer term.  Although the focus has been, up to now, on adaptation for the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries, there is some ground to promote the design of lowcarbon development paths (i.e. mitigation), which are compatible with poverty reduction objectives in those countries.  A specific focus on mechanisms to avoid deforestation and promote sustainable management of forests is crucial. Indeed, the fight against tropical deforestation is the largest immediate mitigation challenge for the LDCs, and they can be beneficiaries, through mechanisms such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation schemes, of its international financing.  Similarly, ensuring in the future a more balanced distribution of the CDM (clean development mechanisms) investments in favour of the LDCs should also be part of the current reflection on the reform of this mechanism.  Finally, a word on the delivery channels for climate funding. We as the Commission are not in favour of creating new funds. New funding for climate should use existing and potentially improved delivery channels, promoting a decentralised bottomup governance structure in support of countryowned actions.
10003961 author: Jennifer Bauer:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to you today before you finalise your first reading of the  2010  draft budget with Thursdays vote.  I would like, first of all, to thank Parliament for restoring the preliminary draft budget in many areas.  The Commission very much welcomes Parliaments focus on using the budget as a tool to overcome the current crisis by enhancing economic growth, competitiveness, cohesion and job protection.  The Commission also welcomes the inclusion, in Parliaments first reading, of the Amending Letter requesting increased spending, notably for Palestine, climate change and accompanying measures in favour of ACP countries.  Turning to the core issues of the present budget procedure, the Commission has fully understood that Parliament regards the financing of the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan as a priority. Let me tell you that this is a priority for the Commission too. From that point of view, I understand the logic behind the European Parliaments socalled asterisk amendment on the Recovery Plan going beyond the current expenditure ceiling.  Next week, the Commission will present a package to address the needs related to the Recovery Plan with a view to reaching an agreed solution at the November conciliation.  At this stage, the Commission has not yet identified all the sources of financing corresponding to the full amount for the energy projects required by the recovery Plan in  2010 . However, the Commission will endeavour to identify all possible availabilities with a view to closing any outstanding gap in time for the November conciliation.  The Commission is concerned about the current difficulties in the dairy sector and we have taken due note of Parliaments proposal to create a special Milk Fund and of the stance taken by the ministers of agriculture. In line with the proposal made yesterday by my colleague, Marianne Fischer Boel, next weeks Amending Letter to the  2010  budget will propose that EUR  280  million be dedicated to help address the immediate consequences of the crisis for milk producers.  This new proposal has an impact on the initially envisaged financing of the gap for the EERP but, as I said, the Commission will deploy all efforts to eventually find the necessary resources in time for the conciliation meeting.  Now I would like to draw your attention to a number of issues where Parliaments first reading gives rise to concerns.  The European Parliament is proposing an overall increase of nearly  10  in the level of payments compared to  2009 , which is some  4  above the level proposed by the Commission. While I share the wish of the European Parliament to support economic growth through the EU programmes, we should also take into account the amount of payments that can be reasonably executed without undermining sound financial management. The Commission has no reason at this stage to depart from the estimates made in its preliminary draft budget.  Concerning the administrative support lines of spending programmes, the socalled BA lines, I understand the wish of the European Parliament to take a quite restrictive approach in the current circumstances. But it is also important to provide the appropriate administrative means for managing growing financial envelopes of programmes if we want this budget to be adequately executed. The Commission hopes there will be the opportunity to redress this issue in the second reading.  Parliament has also voted a number of reserves which, if maintained in the final budget, will have an adverse effect on budget execution. The reserve on salaries, if maintained in the course of the year, would have an adverse effect on recruitment of new officials in  2010  to replace personnel leaving the Commission.  Let me conclude by assuring you that, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, the Commission will give its position on the amendments adopted by Parliament in early November through the socalled letter on executability and I hope Parliament can take it into account in its second reading.  The Commission will continue to act as honest broker and will do its utmost to help pave the way for a successful outcome to this budget procedure, bearing in mind that the financing of the second tranche of the EERP represents a real challenge for which all efforts should be heading in the same direction. I count on your support for achieving a satisfactory and balanced result there.
4875236 author: Lynne White:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, having listened carefully to the discussion here tonight, I think you might get the impression from some speeches that this is the first step we are taking to help the dairy sector within the European Union. Nothing could be more wrong. I am quite sure that at least some of you know what has been going on since January this year when we started on the public and private storage, we started intervention, and we started export refunds. We have been taking lots of different measures over the summer so I think we should devise a special study to tell the new Members of this Parliament exactly what has been going on since last January.  On the specific points on the two proposals here today, I have to repeat again that the buyup scheme is not a new scheme. It is already there for Member States to use if they want to help specific dairy farmers out of business. It is an offer, and that is why I do not want to make it compulsory; it is a possibility for helping farmers out of business. The quota they buy out can be kept in the national reserve and distributed at a later stage if Member States so wish. This was one part of the discussion.  The other part, which has aroused by far the most interest today, is Article  186 . The reason for introducing dairy farming into Article  186  is the fact that we need to be able to react fast. By the way, I do not see any reason why dairy farming should not be part of Article  186 , as areas specifically within the meat sector are already there. And, in general, those who fear that the Commission will get a blank cheque and do whatever they want should keep in mind that Article  186  is normally by nature a very positive scheme where it is possible to try to help people who are in difficulties by reacting very fast. So it is not a blank cheque. It will be discussed, as you probably know, in the Management Committee.  I have listened to your ideas concerning a more limited period of three or four years. I think it would disqualify dairy farmers  but of course I have listened to what you say.  Then I think there are lots of mistaken ideas going round. This EUR  280  million is not for restructuring. It simply offers a possibility of paying out very quickly as soon as we have the formalities in place, with the acceptance from the Ecofin meeting in November and the signing of the budget for  2010 . This means we can act immediately, which would not be the case if we do not have Article  186  in place. So it is not restructuring. As I said before, it gives Member States the possibility of paying the most needy from this national budget.  How should it be distributed? I have clearly said it has to be on the basis of production. I can hear that there may be other ideas but if we start discussing internally how to distribute, then I think it would take at least to the end of next year because there would be so many great ideas we would never be able to find a common line on this issue.  I will reply to some of the specific questions. I would like to say that producer organisations are an excellent option. It is actually necessary. I have said that clearly in plenary before, specifically when discussing the fruit and vegetable scheme. If farmers spend their time and efforts competing against each other instead of competing with the strong retail sector, I know who the winners and the losers will be. Therefore I say: do work together to be a much stronger body in the whole food chain.  I completely agree with you that we have a global problem, that we have one billion people starving, not being able to get what they need to eat every day. That is why I was hurt to see European farmers spreading milk all over the fields in a situation where we are facing starvation problems globally. That is not the best image for European agriculture.  I have to say that I am very impressed at the way in which two Members, Mr Bov and Mr Husling, managed to gear their speaking time. I noticed very carefully how it was done. I do not know if it is a new procedure of the House that one speaker can substitute for another who then goes in to speak under catchtheeye. It was quite smart, I would say.  (Applause)
6378930 author: Claire Cameron:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, I broadly agree with the lines expressed by Cecilia Malmstrm on behalf of the European Council. Let me highlight two main issues: the Lisbon Treaty and all institutional matters on the one hand, and the fight against climate change and the prospects for Copenhagen, on the other.  First of all, I think this European Council should be able to take the final decisions to see the Treaty of Lisbon pass into force. For many years, we have known that the ratification of a new Treaty is not an easy business. We have had many setbacks and some disappointments, but every time the overriding case for the Treaty has won through  the compelling case for a democratic and effective Europe. I am confident that this will continue to be the case in jumping this final hurdle to seeing the Treaty enter into force after the strong support given to the Lisbon Treaty by the people of Ireland.  After the conclusion of the ratification process in Poland, we can now say that all Member States have democratically approved the Lisbon Treaty. We only need to see the process of ratification completed in the Czech Republic. Of course, the constitutional procedures under way in the Czech Republic must be respected, so too must be the need to respond to the democratic will to see the Treaty enter into force. That democratic will was clearly shown by the Parliament of the Czech Republic, so I hope that no artificial obstacles and no artificial delays will now cause more difficulties before full ratification.  I have already set out to this Parliament the importance of minimising delays in the nomination of the European Commission. However, we must do all we can to have a Lisbon Treaty Commission as these are critical times for Europe. We need to be able to push ahead with an agenda this Parliament supported when it elected me President for a new term. To achieve this and to have the institutions working properly, we do need ratification of the Lisbon Treaty if we want a strong, coherent and effective European Union. So, I again make it clear that the European Council must assume its responsibilities and there must be a recognition of urgency and a realisation that there will be a real cost to Europe as long as the European institutions cannot work properly.  At the same time, it is right to push ahead now with the work on implementation and to be ready for the entry into force of the Treaty. I know that this Parliament is fully committed to this work. I am pleased to be cooperating with you to ensure that the benefits of the Treaty will come into play as quickly as possible. There are many areas in which this Parliament has already begun its work and has made a major contribution, crystallising ideas in areas like the European citizens initiative. I know that this afternoon, you will be debating Elmar Broks report on the European External Action Service. The report starts from exactly the right basis to ensure that the service, like the rest of the Treatys innovations, makes our Community system even stronger and better performing.  I know there have been concerns from the outset that the EAS will be some kind of intergovernmental body floating outside the European Union system, but the service should be firmly anchored in the European Union system. It should inevitably work very closely with all the institutions, the Commission first and foremost. The decisions it prepares will be taken by the Commission or by the Council in CFSP matters. In fact, I am convinced that its success will depend on this to ensure that the European Unions external action is more than the sum of its institutional parts. If it can work with the democratic underpinning of this Parliament, the Councils connection with national administrations and the Commissions expertise and European vision, that service can truly become a powerful tool for the European Union to achieve its goals on the global stage. A communautaire European external service, a service based on the Community method, will be a strong service for Europe and a strong tool for a united Europe projecting its influence in the world.  At the same time, the European Council must take forward an active policy agenda. It must maintain the momentum of our work to address the economic crisis, mainly its impact on unemployment. We must carry forward the work we agreed at the G 20 . We must do everything we can to see that the proposals made by the European Commission on financial supervision enter into force as soon as possible. We must push on with our programme to address energy security.  The most important issue in policy terms in the Council will be Copenhagen. A successful outcome at Copenhagen remains a primary concern for Europeans and a major task for the global community. There are less than  50  days to go to Copenhagen. Progress in the negotiations remains slow. It falls again to the European Union to show leadership and to keep up the momentum. The targets we have put on the table have provided an inspiration for others to step up their actions, but we all know that to galvanise real global action, we need to take a further step. We need to help developing countries with concrete ideas on finance, as the European Commission proposed last month. We estimate that by  2020 , developing countries will need an additional EUR  100  billion or so a year. Domestic finance, namely from the large emerging economies  developing but emerging economies  and the carbon market should cover a large part of this, but largescale international public finance should also be forthcoming, with the European Union paying its fair share.  The Copenhagen agenda is not just about climate change. This is, of course, the main target, but the climate is also a question of a development, and we should not forget that very important dimension. This will be a major commitment, especially at a time when public budgets are already under pressure, but we all know that the longer we wait, the higher the costs will be. The task for the European Council is again to find creative solutions, to show that the European Union is united behind the need to fight climate change.  First, Copenhagen must show that the drive to cut emissions is on its way; second, it must show that we are prepared to help those ready to take that step. This is the best way to make the case for the kind of active Europe that the Lisbon Treaty brings  driving ahead with an agenda that shows that the European Union brings concrete benefits for its citizens.  To have an ambitious agenda, we need to have an effective institutional framework, and I come back to my first point. The Lisbon Treaty is the first Treaty of the enlarged Europe. This generation, particularly among our friends in central and eastern Europe, remembers well when Europe was divided, but we are not here for ever. Institutions will last, so we need to have institutions for the enlarged Europe. The Lisbon Treaty is the Treaty for the Europe of the  21 st century, with strong institutions which are able to deliver concrete results in the Europe of  27  and more members in the future. Institutions alone, however, are not enough. We need a strong political will to achieve our goals, and I hope that the European Council at the end of this month will show that will for a strong ambitious outcome at Copenhagen.  (Applause)
9341031 author: Lynne Brown:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, first of all, thank you very much for this lively and interesting debate. It is very clear that the sense of urgency about the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty is tangible in this House and in this debate. As you will understand, the Commission, like Parliament, is eagerly awaiting the entry into force of this new Treaty.  We all know that the political process of approval has now been concluded in all Member States. It is, of course, for each Member State to finalise the ratification process and, in so doing, they have to respect their internal procedures, but it is also clear that no individual Member State acts in a vacuum. Their decisions or delays will have an impact on all.  We of course hope that the Czech Republic will very soon be in a position to ratify the Treaty. I would also like to remind everybody here about the loyal cooperation that is one of the principles and main features of the European Union. I think it is of crucial importance that Member States can trust each other on the commitments made.  May I also comment on the fact that many of the Members of Parliament here have made a distinction or a divide between reality  with unemployment and an economic crisis  on the one hand, and the text of the Lisbon Treaty on the other, but of course, the whole idea is that the text of the Lisbon Treaty is there to deal with the context and that we will be better equipped to take effective decisions on immigration or asylum policy, on energy security, etc. This is the whole idea, and we have to link them instead of dividing them, but we hope that we will very soon come to the end of this eternal debate on institutional issues and be able to use these new effective instruments.  The Commission is now working actively to prepare for implementation when the Treaty enters into force. I know that this afternoon, you will be devoting a specific debate to the External Action Service. This is therefore not the time to enter into a full discussion on that issue. But I would say that we are facing a real challenge here.  It is a challenge to draw together the different players in the field of external relations, and the overall aim has to be to achieve a diplomatic synergy. A certain degree of creative thinking is necessary while respecting the interinstitutional balance.  We also need the Service to be fully accountable to this House  to the European Parliament. I strongly believe that the settingup of the External Action Service can be a success if Council, Parliament and the Commission work closely together. We must also respect the fact that it is for the High Representative and VicePresident of the Commission to make a proposal in agreement with the Commission.  On another important issue, the European Citizens Initiative, the Commission intends to launch a Green Paper in midNovember. We intend to hold a broad consultation with citizens, civil society and all stakeholders in order to launch the legislative proposals very soon after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.  The consequences of the economic and financial crisis will appear high up on the Council agenda. We heard this particular theme evoked often during the debate. I agree with those who said that there is no room for complacency. It is true that the policies in response to the crisis are starting to bear some fruit  financial markets are starting to consolidate and confidence is improving  but we are far from full recovery and the consequences of unemployment are, and will remain, very severe. Political efforts must also continue to support active labour market policies.  The Commission of course  and I say this in response to some of the questions raised during the debate  stands by its budget proposal. We hope that Parliament will also confirm our ambitions by your vote. As President Barroso said yesterday in the Question Hour, what has been done so far is not enough.  The employment situation is such that we all need to do more at European, but also at national, level. Unemployment is our first concern today and we hope that we can count on the European Parliament in continuing work on this, and also to put pressure on the Council, and at national level, to approve our proposal on easing the management of the structural funds, because that could definitely help.  Another issue raised concerned the administrative burden. This Thursday, the Commission will adopt a very farreaching Communication on administrative burden reduction. That Communication will set out what has been achieved so far and what still remains to be done. It also builds on the important work done by the Stoiber Group. According to this particular report, the picture is very positive, and the proposal for how to deal with the administrative burden reduction is on the table. Unfortunately the majority of these proposals are pending before the Council, so again we hope that the European Parliament will help us to put pressure on the Member States to actually move forward on these issues.  I would also like to say something about financial market supervision which has, of course, regularly appeared on the Commission agenda over recent months. A complete new supervisory framework must be set up at EU level, and we are pleased to see that some progress has been achieved. There is broad agreement in the Council on the Commission proposal on the Systemic Risk Board for macroprudential supervision. We hope Parliament will give its support to this. Much more effort is needed when it comes to the supervisory authorities for microprudential supervision and, again, we count on the will of both Council and Parliament to arrive at an ambitious and efficient solution as soon as possible.  Finally, let me say something about the topic which also features at the top of the Swedish Presidencys agenda, namely climate change, because we only have a few weeks to go to the Copenhagen conference. I think several of you have touched upon what will be the core issue which will determine success or failure. I would call it climate justice, because this is about the relation between developing and developed countries and the will to present a credible proposal for the financing of both mitigation and adaptation measures and the way we also show our willingness to lead the way.  The Commission  and it is the only body to have done this  has presented a proposal for financing. It has been criticised by many as not being enough. I am sure it will not be enough, but it is the first step, and hopefully it will also make the others come up with their own efforts and put something on the table that we will be able to negotiate in Copenhagen. We will, of course, continue to be fully active and not lower our level of ambition, but instead encourage all other parties and partners to take a full part and take a seat at the table  including the United States, for the first time  so that we can respond to all the concerns of citizens.  I can assure you that we have no intention of lowering our ambitions, but instead will make sure that we work proactively for a good deal in Copenhagen.
5092653 author: Katarina Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, we are, I hope, on the very last lap of the process of bringing the Treaty of Lisbon into force, completing a process which has taken eight years of discussions and negotiations. After the decisive result of the Irish referendum, we all hope that the Czech ratification can finally follow very soon. If we achieve this on the  20 th anniversary of the reunification of Europe, it will be a great day for Europe and its citizens  not least because we will be able to focus all our attention on the pressing challenges and policy concerns that lie ahead of us.  As we reach the final stages, allow me to congratulate Parliament, and particularly the Constitutional Affairs Committee, with Elmar Brok as rapporteur, on delivering its opinion on the key element of the Lisbon Treaty which is the External European Action Service. The creation of the EEAS offers the European Union and all its component institutions the chance to achieve what we have long hoped for: to have a common voice in the world and to strengthen the EUs influence in the world.  Mr Broks report recognises this great potential. Together with this important debate and many other consultations with Parliament representatives, it provides vital input to our work with the Swedish Presidency, but also with the Member States and the Council Secretariat, over the coming months. I am happy to confirm that the Commission strongly supports Parliaments overall approach. I agree with the principles of transparency, democracy and coherence that you have just mentioned. It is obviously important that all the institutions work together to help the newlyappointed High Representative VicePresident in his or her task of preparing the decision on the creation of an EEAS  a decision which, as you know, requires the consent of the Commission and the consultation of Parliament.  Firstly, let me mention the status of the EEAS. Indeed it will be sui generis as there is no model to follow. We are building something new. It will neither be intergovernmental nor purely based on the Community method, but we must ensure that the new system has a genuinely European approach inspired by and grounded in the strengths of Community policies, as again was mentioned. The key question for us all is what the EEAS should be able to deliver. This should be our objective. By bringing together the various actors in the field of external relations, we can ensure that our relations with the outside world are clear, coherent and driven by a single set of policy goals. It must carry authority as the core of EU external policy, the place where policy is developed and coordinated. It must also be seen to be such, both from inside and from outside the European Union, and the EEAS will only be effective if it works well with other institutions and fully respects the interinstitutional balance.  This is why I think it is very important that the EEAS should be set up in a way which allows it to work very closely with the Commission and the Council and to respect the need to be fully accountable to the European Parliament. For the Parliament, the bringing together of external action responsibilities into a single service will, I believe, mean a step change in Parliaments capacity to fulfil its role of scrutinising Union policy. Like the service itself, the way in which Parliament relates to the service and to the High Representative VicePresident will also, in a way, have to be sui generis.  The creation of the EEAS will require a variety of decisions, probably including changes to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations, both of which require a Commission proposal and adoption through codecision.  The High Representative VicePresident needs the authority to manage the service, but the service also needs to serve the EU system as a whole  most obviously, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council, as well as the other Commissioners with a role in external relations. It must be able to offer its assistance, both in Brussels and in third countries, to the European Parliament and to its official delegations which travel abroad.  The close involvement of the Member States in the new service is one of its key innovations. The COREPER ambassadors are looking at how best to ensure that highquality Member States diplomats can be brought into the service early. We in the Commission are examining how this may be done pending the modification of the Staff Regulations, and appointment to the service should be through selection procedures based on merit, with appropriate account being taken of the need for a geographic and gender balance. This very much meets the wishes expressed in the report.  We also believe that all members of the EEAS, whether officials of the EU institutions or Member States officials on temporary contracts, should enjoy the same rights. They will be equal in every sense.  As for the scope of the service, it needs to have a comprehensive overview of the Unions relations with the rest of the world, so it needs geographical desks as well as horizontal services to cover questions such as CFSP and CSDP, human rights and relations with UN bodies. The aim is to prevent duplication and to ensure that all those responsible for delivering EU external policy work effectively together, and the Commission will also continue to have services responsible for trade, development policy, aid implementation, humanitarian aid and enlargement. It will also, of course, continue to drive the external aspects of the Unions key internal policies, and a central question in the current debate is how to manage the programming of external assistance.  I can assure Parliament that the EUs development policy, including poverty eradication, will be a central part of the Commissions external activities. The High Representative VicePresident and the Commissioner for Development will work extremely closely together on this. The fact that the new High Representative will also be a VicePresident of the Commission, responsible for coordinating all of the EUs external action, will help. The service will also be responsible for the administration of delegations, though the people inside delegations will come, as now, from different services  not just the EEAS, but also the Commission services and maybe other institutions and bodies of the European Union.  From the entry into force of the Treaty, Commission delegations will become EU delegations. This will give them new responsibilities, but it will not diminish their role in representing the full range of Commission activities. The EU delegations should be responsible for representation, coordination and negotiation as from the day the Treaty comes into force. In most places, this procedure will go quite smoothly. However, in some, where the workload is particularly heavy, it will be necessary to organise a form of burdensharing, not only with the rotating Presidency but also with other Member States.  The creation of an entirely new external service is a major undertaking. It will, as your report says, evolve over time. We will learn together. Our first aim must be that during the period between the entry into force of the Treaty and the coming into being of the EEAS, the effective delivery of the EUs external policies is maintained. We and the Council Secretariat will work together with the High Representative VicePresident to ensure that there is no gap. But we need to look further. We will be bringing together officials and diplomats from the different institutions and all the Member States. As we know, a common foreign policy is not just the sum of  27  national policies. We need people within the EEAS who, while not losing their distinctive national ties, think European. We therefore need to create an EU diplomatic culture and an EU esprit de corps. For this, training is essential.  The report raises the promising idea of the creation of a European diplomatic academy. In the meantime, we can make good use of the Member States diplomatic academies. I very recently attended the  10 th anniversary of the European diplomatic programme, which has anticipated and shown the way. It is worth remarking that since the  1970 s, the Commission has already organised training seminars for more than  5   700  diplomats. One of the tasks of the EEAS will be to establish a training strategy to ensure that all members, whatever their background, will be equipped to carry out their tasks. Heads of delegations, in particular, will have to be able not only to carry out their political role, but also to handle all the Commission activities that are such a substantial part of a delegations mandate.  Mr Broks report also raises the question of whether consular services might be covered by the EEAS. The Commission is open to this idea even if it may take some time to develop. These are matters for the future. For the present, it is a challenge for us to ensure that the EEAS functions well and in the interests of all: the European citizens, the Member States and the European Union. The Commission supports the creation of the EEAS, wants it to succeed, and will contribute in every way possible to ensure that it does so. This report shows that Parliament will do the same.  I am sorry to have been a little long, but I think this is such an important matter. Please forgive me, Mr President.
5430865 author: Christoph Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, in my remarks, I shall touch upon the forthcoming EUUS Summit that will be an important milestone in our transatlantic partnership, as well as addressing certain EUUS aspects, particularly on climate change negotiations under way and also some critical GLS issues.  The change in the US Administration in January has had a very significant impact on EUUS relations, and our partnership has got off to a good start. I would say we have reenergised our relations and I am convinced that the Lisbon Treaty, once in force, will also contribute towards the further strengthening of this vital relationship by providing the European Union with an even stronger foreign policy identity. That is also what our friends in Washington expect.  But let us be also clear. Our aspiration for a true partnership of equals with the United States also means that Europeans must be willing and able to deliver. I would say that it is a dual momentum, internal and external, that makes the summit in Washington so important.  The first formal summit with President Obama took place after our informal meeting in Prague this spring. Now the preparations for the Washington Summit are in full swing. We are working with the US side on delivering tangible results in priority areas. The global economy and climate change are likely to be the two major areas of focus of the summit discussion, in addition to a number of key foreign policy challenges.  On the economy, the focus in Washington will be on joint efforts to combat the economic and financial crisis and securing a sustainable global economic recovery to secure jobs and create growth. We will move further on governance issues for the global economy, notably on financial regulation and a timely followup to the G 20  Pittsburgh Summit. The Commission will also emphasise our joint interest in countering protectionist tendencies and we will call on the US to renew efforts to bring the Doha Round to a successful end.  Secondly, on climate change, we as the European Union will encourage the US to go to the Copenhagen conference with ambitious objectives to reach a sound global agreement, and we will also engage with the US to make progress on establishing a capandtrade system across the Atlantic.  Thirdly, on foreign policy, we will, of course, also discuss with the US how to meet urgent foreign policy challenges. Here we will focus on how to cooperate further and more closely on the Middle East peace process, on the challenges posed by the nuclear ambitions of Iran, and on ways in which we can assure the renewal of the compact in Afghanistan, which is at the basis of our concerted efforts there. I will have a separate foreign policy meeting with Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Bildt to discuss these matters in greater detail.  Furthermore, I expect the summit also to adopt a declaration on nonproliferation and disarmament, taking forward EUUS cooperation in many of the areas identified by President Obama in his speeches in Prague and New York. This initiative, which carries strategic importance in itself, is indicative of the renewed US commitment towards effective multilateralism, which the European Union has every intention of supporting and consolidating.  Last but not least, a further major summit outcome will be the creation of a new EUUS Energy Council which will have its first meeting on  4  November. On the EU side, the Council will be chaired by myself, my colleagues, Commissioners Piebalgs and Potonik, and the Presidency, and on the US side by Secretary Clinton and Secretary Chu. The Council will look at global energy security, energy markets and product regulation, at new technologies and research. In short, it will provide added value in a policy field, the importance of which is obvious.  Now there is also a new Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). That will be complementary to the Energy Council, which we will reenergise as well. The TEC meets in Washington next Tuesday  so before the Energy Council  and its outcome will obviously feed into the summit talks as well.  A promising area in our transatlantic cooperation is what we call upstream cooperation. We will discuss policy approaches early on, so that we will avoid divergent regulation down the road. It goes without saying that we need such cooperation more than ever. The needed coherent response to the financial crisis is the best example for it. We will also explore whether we can intensify this forum of cooperation for nanomaterial health carerelated information.  Upon a US initiative, we also intend to launch closer cooperation in the area of innovation. Both sides recognise that enhancing the innovative potential of our industries and our workforces is essential for the creation of jobs and growth and therefore for a successful emergence of the coming crisis. And the Commission, of course, will also repeat our European concerns on some critical issues such as securing trade, potential distortions of competition from State aid and procurement policy in the US.  Finally, we as the Commission have also, from the very beginning, strongly relied on the European Parliaments support for the TEC process, and we are grateful for this. So rest assured that we will very much support the initiatives by the European Parliaments delegations for relations with the USA to strengthen parliamentary involvement in TEC matters on both sides of the Atlantic.  We would like to consolidate the TECs role as a bilateral forum to address both daytoday and strategic issues regarding transatlantic trade and investment. And importantly, the TEC will have reached out to the transatlantic legislators dialogue and civil society stakeholders, too, so clearly we need the expertise and political thrust of legislators to tap the full potential of the transatlantic market place.  My colleague has already mentioned that GLS will also be very important. There will be a Troika meeting on GLS affairs on  27  and  28  October in Washington, in the framework of our cooperation on justice, freedom and security. VicePresident Barrot will represent the Commission. We are in the final stages of preparing a statement that will aim to renew our transatlantic partnership in these areas. In the Washington meeting, there will be the opportunity formally to exchange the instruments of ratification of the extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements so that they can enter into force in early  2010 . These agreements will strengthen our efforts in fighting crime in todays globalised world.  On another critical matter close to the hearts of the citizens, we certainly need to make further progress, as was mentioned. We will reiterate the call for visafree travel to the US for all EU citizens; we will express our concern over the prospect of a fee for the electronic system for travel authorisation as the de facto new tourist tax; and we will once again remind the US of the need to lift the restrictions on travellers with HIVAIDS under the US visa waiver programme, as you have mentioned.  Finally, a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will be travelling to Washington around the time of the ministerial meeting, so we trust they will also be able to convey the same messages. VicePresident Barrot is also ready to meet the Committee on Civil Liberties delegation while in Washington.
3203166 author: Katarina MacLeod:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I would first of all agree with James Elles about a greater strategic dialogue with a great strategic partner. This is the objective that we have.  As I said before, it is about cooperating for global recovery, so financial and economic questions will be very high on our agenda. We have been one of the driving forces behind the activation of the G 20  Summit process which was raised, as you know, to leaders level last November on the initiative of President Barroso and President Sarkozy, but we are not the only ones that are needed.  The Pittsburgh G 20  Summit has also been a success in providing a platform for flexible macroeconomic coordination as we also seek exit strategies to gradually pare back our respective policies of immediate crisis response.  The IMF and the World Bank agree that this will require different approaches from each party depending on the respective economic situation. Given the current global economic situation, the leaders will naturally also discuss possible ways out of the crisis, of boosting growth and creating jobs, and the question of the regulation of financial markets will be particularly important.  We think it is necessary to ensure the rapid establishment of a globally coordinated system of macroprudential supervision based upon close cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board.  On banking, we need to deploy the London and Pittsburgh commitments for better and more capital and stricter prudential rules consistently among financial centres. We need to intensify our work towards effective global convergence policies on crisis management and systemically important financial institutions.  We should also achieve a single set of highquality global accounting standards on financial instruments by the end of  2010  and, hopefully, complete convergence by June  2011 .  On climate change, we had a very first exchange on climate change with President Obama in Prague. I was personally present and we pressured the United States to do more on climate change, but we also know that President Obama has a very important health care issue in Congress and the Senate. I therefore think that we will have to put even more pressure on him to redouble the efforts to find committed, binding regulations for Copenhagen, in the light of his preoccupation with the domestic agenda.  With regard to the TEC, this is a very important new mechanism, or reenergised mechanism, to work on all matters regarding the free market and market barriers. We want to eliminate these, which is the ultimate objective of the TEC. This was clearly stated in the TEC framework agreement of  30  April  2007 . Of course, I am aware of the different ideas that have been raised recently  such as reaching a unified transatlantic market by  2015  through the elimination of existing obstacles to economic integration: the socalled Milln Mon report. We no doubt need to work on the right balance between ambition and realism, which is why we are working on mediumterm priority tasks for the TEC.  On the question of barriers, we already know that you, Parliament, want to have a study, and we welcome your support for this study. It would be important in guiding future work for the TEC. The study has not yet been finalised, but is under way, and there are still a number of technical issues to be cleared up before it is totally ready for publication. Commissioner Ashton here will deal with this, and I will certainly convey Parliaments interest.  Let me also say, because this was mentioned, that the Energy Council will not overlap with the TEC. The agendas will complement each other. It is clear that security issues will go to the Energy Council, whereas regulatory issues go to the TECH. The focus of the Energy Council is on new technologies and energy security.  A very brief word on SWIFT and some GLS questions that have been mentioned. The SWIFT agreement is needed as it sets out specific safeguards on data. That is clear and the mutual legal assistance agreement would also really like to go there.  It should also be known that this mutual legal assistance agreement is at the heart of the SWIFT agreement, and any US request is subject to the authorisation of an EU judicial authority within that framework, so we have to keep working on it.  On the ESTA, we issued a preliminary assessment which concluded that, based on the interim final rule, ESTA is not tantamount to the Schengen visa application process as defined in the European Commissions common consular instructions. We will, however, prepare a final assessment once the final rule on ESTA has been published, and this evaluation will also address the question of the ESTA fee if the fee is really put into place. You can imagine that we do not want it.  A last answer on terrorism. In our work on the summit, we are discussing with the US how to move towards closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism, especially in the light of the plans to close Guantnamo.  The need to ensure respect for fundamental rights is essential. The conclusion of the mutual legal assistance treaties will also help us in this respect. We will therefore also cooperate on how to prevent radicalism, including misuse of the Internet.  You can see that there is an enormous range of issues. We have spoken about all the political issues before, but I agree with the Council President that although this will be an important summit, it will only be one meeting of a few hours. Not everything will be solved in one meeting, but it will be a very good restart or rebeginning.
4549969 author: Christoph Bush:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Mr President, it is my pleasure to be back here again and to report to you on the results of what proved to be a very complicated and challenging European Council meeting.  Let me explain the situation on the eve of the European Council. We were in constant contact with Prague and other capitals. How would we solve the Czech request regarding the Charter of Fundamental Rights? There were many different views, and there were calls for various exemptions and special considerations from several other Member States.  In contrast, we got a clearer message on climate change  the other main subject for the meeting. The message from a number of Member States was that they were not ready to commit to figures on climate financing, i.e. how to finance adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries.  Given these circumstances, I am satisfied with the outcome of the meeting. Let me point out the highlights.  Our objective at the European Council was  as Decembers Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen approaches  to continue to lead the way on climate change. Let there be no illusions. The negotiations were both lengthy and difficult, but in the end, our discussions led to an endorsement by the European Council of the Commissions estimate of EUR  100  billion annually by  2020 , and it estimated that the level of international public support should lie in the range of EUR  22  billion to EUR  50  billion by the same year.  The year  2020  is only  10  years away. We need to act quicker than that, and so the Council noted that, in addition to this, we need global financing of EUR  5  billion each year from  2010  to  2012 .  A final figure will be determined in the light of the Copenhagen conference. The EU and the Member States are ready to contribute their fair share, if other key players make comparable efforts. I am very pleased that at this European Council, we were able to reach agreement on a strong mandate on this.  A few days ago, I returned from talks with Prime Minister Singh at the EUIndia Summit in New Delhi, and earlier last week, I held talks with President Obama at the EUUS Summit in Washington.  Thanks to the agreement at the European Council, the EU was able to negotiate from a very strong position. Our unity gave us the credibility to encourage others. We were able to present our commitments. We were able to express our expectations. And we were once again able to lead the way on an issue that is crucial to all citizens.  Last weeks meeting was also about the economic and financial situation. Although there are signs of improvement in the world economy, the European Council stressed that there is no room for complacency. Next year, all but one of the Member States risk exceeding the  3  deficit ceiling, and our collective GDP has shrunk by  4 . 7  since the beginning of  2008 . Both of these are strong reasons why we should not withdraw supporting measures until we have secured our recovery. In the meantime, we need to reinforce confidence and continue work on our exit strategies.  At the European Council, we made significant progress on strengthening financial supervision. We reached broad agreement on the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board.  The Presidency will now begin to discuss the proposals with this Parliament. We want to reach agreement on a package for a new supervisory structure. We want to make sure that we do not suffer a repeat of the financial crisis we have just experienced.  With all this in place and on its way, we must focus on safeguarding jobs. Over five million Europeans have already lost their jobs, and far too many will still face unemployment. It is up to us to change this trend.  When I presented the priorities of the Swedish Presidency to you on  15  July, I said that the EU must emerge strengthened from the crisis. I told you that handling the economic and financial crisis was one of our most important tasks. It still is. For this reason, we intend to return to these important issues at the European Council meeting in December.  Another important outcome of this meeting was the adoption of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region  a strategy that is based on an initiative from this Parliament. Our ambition with the strategy is to address the urgent environmental challenges related to the Baltic Sea, and to contribute to the economic success of the region. I am convinced that this initiative will also have a positive effect on other parts of Europe, pulling regions together and making a positive contribution to the competitiveness of the EU as a whole.  We also discussed justice and home affairs. We welcomed the progress made in implementing measures concerning illegal migration in the Mediterranean, and we called for work in a number of specific areas.  I know that you also want to discuss institutional matters this afternoon. They were, of course, an important element of the discussions.  Indeed, one of the key issues was to ensure the rapid entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which is crucial if we want to be able to confront the challenges that lie ahead together.  The consultations were many and they were very complicated, but in the end, we managed to gain acceptance for the request made by the Czech Republic.  With this agreement in place, President Vclav Klaus was prepared to sign the treaty, and  as you all noted  he finally did so a week ago. The final instrument of ratification is now being deposited by the Czech Republic with the Italian authorities. This means that the Lisbon Treaty will enter into force on  1  December. I know that the vast majority of you here today share my satisfaction and relief that finally, this long chapter of preparations for institutional reform is coming to an end.  The European Council also assessed other treaty preparations. It agreed on guidelines for the European External Action Service and it invited the future High Representative to present a proposal for the organisation and running of the Service.  Now to the question of names. We need to fill the positions created by the Lisbon Treaty. We need, together with you, to appoint a new Commission. I plan to convene a meeting of Heads of States or Government on  19  November in order to nominate the President of the European Council, the High Representative and the SecretaryGeneral of the Council.  Let me stress that the nomination of the High Representative will have to take place before the new Commission is appointed, and that this should be preceded by appropriate contacts with this Parliament. As you know, since this person will also be VicePresident of the next Commission, he or she will also be subject to the Parliaments vote of approval.  I will not speculate on who these persons will be, but I would like to say that it is not just the name that is important, but also what they will be doing and how they will do it.  Last weeks European Council enabled us to make significant progress, not just on one key issue, but on several issues that are vital for the future of Europe and vital for the future of our planet.  I am grateful to my colleagues for their constructive attitude towards the challenges we face together. Nevertheless, you and I know that much remains to be done. I can promise you that the coming weeks will be very busy. I look forward to continuing our close cooperation with this Parliament on many of the important issues.  The Copenhagen meeting is actually now only  25  days away. The economic crisis is far from over, but we have a solid mandate going into the climate negotiations. We are determined to continue to work together to generate new sources of growth and higher employment.  I am grateful for the continuing support from this Parliament. I look forward to responding to your comments.
10213340 author: Annette Cameron:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, let me complement Prime Minister Reinfeldts assessment of the European Council by commenting on two aspects, one on policy and one on institutional issues.  As regards policy, the key deliverable was the very important agreement on our action on climate change. We all know these are difficult issues. When there is so much at stake, the road will never be easy. Frankly, the European Council result exceeded my initial expectations. We got the approval of the numbers the Commission proposed, accompanied by strong conditionality.  The message is clear: the European Union is ready for Copenhagen and ready to follow our action to cut emissions with a powerful offer on climate finance, just as the Commission proposed in September, both in the longer term and in fast start funding.  If we want developing countries to come to the table with serious commitments on mitigation, then we need developed countries to put money on the table. Our assessment is that by  2020 , developing countries will need around an additional EUR  100  billion a year to tackle climate change and this was fully backed by the European Council, as is the likely share of public international finance in that figure, and agreement that the European Union will pay its fair share.  It is equally clear: other partners must show that they can match the seriousness of our intent. Our policy is not about the European Union forging ahead in the vague hope that others will follow. It is about using our leverage to bring about the maximum possible in terms of a global effort to cut emissions.  When I was in Washington and New Delhi last week, I was reminded just how far these two partners have come in the past year or so. The same is true of others, like China. Of course, we will continue to respect the important requirement of common but differential responsibility for climate change but, as I have said many times recently, we are all in this together, and we in the European Union will continue to push for real contributions from all the other players. We need to keep focused on the end goal  ambitious, serious, verifiable cuts in emissions to ensure that we keep within our target of limiting temperature increase to less than  2  C.  So what are the prospects for Copenhagen? It now seems to be likely that Copenhagen will not see agreement to the fullyfledged treaty that we have pushed for and will continue to push for. But that is not a reason to accept anything less than a decisive breakthrough in these negotiations. In the end, it is content that matters more than form. In my view, we should try to arrive at a fully operational agreement, based on real political commitments, that comes rapidly into force, and which brings all the major players on board for both emission reductions and finance. And we should continue to fight on for final agreement to a treaty  a binding treaty. To make that happen, we need to join all our forces in the weeks remaining to Copenhagen.  We have just shown that we can, by decisive joint action, agree on a treaty that has proven elusive for a very long time. That was the other major result of the European Council: it lifted the last political hurdle to the final ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. Now we can look forward with confidence because, as Prime Minister Reinfeldt said, the Lisbon Treaty will be in place at the start of next month. In fact, the Commission is working on its implementation. Today, the Commission has launched a consultation on the Citizens Initiative as a first, concrete step.  I would like to pay tribute to Prime Minister Reinfeldt for his sure touch in bringing this ship into port. The Swedish Presidency has done very remarkable work in bringing this final consensus to the European Council. But now we have to complete the task of transition. The focus is, of course, very much on the filling of the new posts.  It is not for me to comment on the candidates for the Presidency of the European Council but, as Commission President and looking at the institutional matters, I very much hope that Heads of State or Government will select the personality that can provide effective leadership to the European Council  a President with a strong European commitment that can give consistency over time to European Council activity, both internally, so that priorities can be set over a longer timeframe and not just for six months, and externally, so that on common foreign and security policy, we send coherent messages to our international partners.  I am committed to working in tandem with this President of the European Council because that partnership will make all the difference. We need to pull together at the level of Heads of State or Government the common foreign and security policy on which the President of the European Council will represent the European Union at this level. We also have to put together all Community competences  from the economy to trade, from enlargement to development, from energy to justice  where the European Commission President represents the European Union according to the treaty. I am committed to making this partnership work in the interests of a strong and effective European Union at home and globally.  That is obviously also true for the High Representative. Here, I confess to a particular interest because that High Representative will also be one of the European Commission VicePresidents. On a very pragmatic level, because the nomination of the VicePresidentHigh Representative, and the other proposals by Member States for the Commission, will allow me to pass to the phase of finalising the next College and attributing portfolios. On a political level, because I am convinced that this High RepresentativeVicePresident, supported by a strong External Action Service bringing together European expertise in intergovernmental diplomacy with our Community competences, can mean a real step change in the effectiveness of our external action.  This brings me to the Commission as a whole. I want a Commission composed of competent and committed Europeans, a Commission that is ready to take all its right of initiative. I am working in my final discussions with Member States to ensure that this is the case. I have asked Member States to come forward with names, including women. Then it will be for me to decide on portfolios. Portfolios are not attributed to countries but to persons that are committed to our European project.  I also want to have a Commission with a strong democratic mandate. That is why I am determined to give full respect to the hearings process in this Parliament. The delays due to the treaty have given us a common challenge. We must not delay the arrival of a new Commission, but we cannot shortcut the hearings. I look forward to discussing how to handle this issue in the Conference of Presidents next week.  The Lisbon Treaty will enable us to deliver better on citizens expectations  but whether we use the opportunities it offers will be, first and foremost, a matter of political will. The treaty gives us the capacity to act but we need the willingness to act together.  That brings me back to the beginning of our afternoon. The Europe represented here today  a Europe united in freedom and solidarity  would not have been possible without the commitment and the dedication of people who made extraordinary things happen  20  years ago. We need to rekindle this flame. We need to have the spirit of  1989 . If we show the same dedication and commitment, I am sure we will succeed.
5908651 author: Christoph LaCourt:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Mr President, I thank the honourable Members very much for their many valuable comments and questions.  As someone stated, it has taken quite a while to get  27  Member States to ratify. We have been discussing this treaty for many years, and I am always surprised to find that I then get questions on how quickly we can stop living after that constitution, because I must base my work on the treaties. It has been defined there that the decisive bodies for the Council President are the Prime Ministers and Heads of State of Europe. That is actually what has been put into the treaties.  Added to that, a problem which is obvious to me is that most of the people that are mentioned are current Prime Ministers of different European countries. It is actually a tense matter to portray oneself as a candidate for a job you might not get, sending a signal to the people that you are leaving the country and then coming home again and saying, Well, I am still here! I think we should respect that this is a factor when it comes to this issue.  On the High Representative, you will have much more transparency, much more discussion, because that will be part of the Commission, part of a decision taken after hearings inside Parliament. Although, to answer Mr Swoboda, it is clear in the treaty coming into force on  1  December that the High Representative goes directly into his or her new job, but has to be part of the Commission approved by Parliament.  This is, of course, complicated but, just to state the obvious as I said the last time, it was never meant to be the way it has now turned out. This was supposed to already be in place before the Swedish Presidency. It is a much lengthier process than anyone could foresee.  On the issue of balancing, because this is something that I also hear, I have just today had the first round of consultations with my  26  colleagues. The problem is that it is a lot of balancing for only two persons. You mentioned geography and gender, but the number one balancing that I am listening to is between CentreLeft and CentreRight. There is a lot of balancing to do, and I would have liked more positions to be able to satisfy all the criteria that have been mentioned here. To say the obvious, it is not that we are not trying to find the best possible balance.  As I said, this will be next Thursday at our summit meeting with an early dinner to meet all your requests for as quick a process as possible. That is what we have been trying to do. There were comments on who is taking this decision. It takes a little while just to consult everyone. We are now EU 27 . Full consultation with my colleagues involves two days work  this is fantastic, but it takes time.  On climate, I agree with Rebecca Harms that Europe is not doing enough. I also want to remind you that we have foreseen a situation where we need to increase our efforts in Europe within legally binding targets, but there is a need for conditionality. This reflects the views of many of my colleagues. They are very precise that, if we should go even further in Europe, we also need the same kind of commitments from other parts of the world.  I welcome country or nationbased decisions which have gone further. We have many examples of that. My country for instance, Sweden, has taken a national target of a  40  reduction until  2020 , and this is true for Germany as well.  We need to do more  and we are not the ones asking to dilute the decision we need to take in Copenhagen  but a lot of work needs to be done to get others to move. As I said, I am back from my travels to India and the United States, and am going to China later in this month, and we need leadership agreement to get this going. That is the tough thing with this. It is a global challenge in a world where we do not have the kind of global leadership or decision taking that we have in the European Union. It is therefore much tougher to deliver but, at the same time, we need to do it.  The European Union, as you know, only accounts for  13  of global emissions. We cannot solve this on our own: we also need commitment from others, especially the major emitters, and they are the ones who seem to be raising their hands and saying we want to be outside of the agreement. That is not possible, as we could never then deliver on the  2  C target.  Finally, during the Swedish Presidency, we will now try to push through the better supervision of the financial market that is needed to get better functioning financial markets for the future.  We will also start discussions that will continue into the Spanish Presidency on competitiveness, on how to get better functioning labour markets, and on how to get out of the crisis once we see clear signs of recovery. This, then, is a balance between learning from the problems we had and creating betterfunctioning financial markets, but also the discussions and the decisions needed to get better competitiveness and betterfunctioning labour markets here in Europe.
5951625 author: Roger Reid:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, I would like to comment briefly on some of the issues that were directly put during the debate.  First of all, regarding climate change, let us be clear. The European Union is committed to a binding treaty. We have been committed to the Kyoto Protocol and have ratified it. All of our Member States have ratified Kyoto, and we are in favour of a binding treaty for the future. If there is anyone who does not want a binding treaty, it is not the European Union.  But the reality is that some of our most important partners are simply not ready for it, so there are two possibilities. One is to insist on something that we know is not going to work, another is to try to have the most advanced and ambitious outcome at Copenhagen. I believe it is still possible, and we will fight for it. To have the most ambitious possible agreement at Copenhagen and  at least for the European Commission, and I am sure the Heads of State or Government agree  we will remain committed to a binding treaty that sets clear targets for the developed countries and clear actions for the developing countries, including the fastgrowing, big emerging economies that also have a responsibility to share. We also need to provide funding to the developing countries  especially the poorest and the least developed countries  because we know very well that, without that support, they will not be able to make the adaptation and mitigation efforts that are needed.  (FR) With regard to the institutional question, let us be totally honest with ourselves. We are now on the eve of the entry into force of a new system that is extremely demanding.  Most of us have fought hard to have this treaty, over many years, at least nine years! After Nice, we wanted a more ambitious treaty, and now we must implement it. It is complex, because our Union is complex  it is a Union of Member States, a Union of citizens.  The most important thing, however, is precisely respect for the treaties. We are a Community based on the rule of law, and the day that we fail to honour our commitment to show full respect for the treaty will definitely be the day that we fail in our duties.  That is why it is crucial in this transition  and when the new treaty is implemented  that respect be shown for the treaties and for the powers of each institution: the powers of Parliament, of course, the powers of the Council, and the powers of the Commission.  I myself am one of those who believe that Europe stands still when one institution uses its power and its authority against the others. I believe that it is a mistake to act in that way. I believe that institutional jealousy is a characteristic shared by mediocre individuals. On the contrary, I believe that we will be stronger if we strengthen one another. I believe that it is entirely in our interests to have a strong European Parliament  and the Treaty of Lisbon gives it increased powers  but also to have a European Council with a consistent and coherent leadership over time, and a strong Commission.  Moreover, in accordance with the treaties, and I cite the Treaty of Lisbon  because we talk about it all the time, but we need to read it sometimes too  Article  17  of which states that it is the Commission that shall promote the general interest of the Union and take appropriate initiatives to that end. It shall ensure the application of the treaties, and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them. In other words, it is the Commissions job to verify whether or not the treaties have been applied, including during this transition. This is a power that the treaty gives to the Commission and which the Commission will, of course, exercise within the scope of its responsibilities.  That being said, it is important to work on a partnership basis in order to strengthen the European institutions. If we do not have institutions that work, what will happen? The Member States  especially some Member States  will tend to take their own decisions outside of the institutions. Is that what we want? I do not think so. We want decisions to be taken within the institutional framework, within the framework of a Community based on the rule of law, and this is what I would like to say to you very frankly and very sincerely: let us mutually strengthen our institutions.  We have heard today the extraordinary plea made by Vclav Havel. It is extraordinary, but as Jean Monnet said, nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions. We now need to put in place strong institutions, and that can only be done in this spirit of partnership. That is why, among other things, I wish to thank you for your suggestions concerning the organisation and structure of the Commission. Like you, I am very attached to the Community method and to the treaty, which provides for a clear division of responsibilities. Under the treaty, the responsibility for the organisation of the Commission falls to its President, and I have no intention of renouncing it.  Therefore, when I present the Commission, I will do what all modest authors do: I will thank all those who advised me, while assuming full responsibility for the final product. Today, I have heard some good and interesting suggestions, but the crucial point to understand is this: each of us must exercise his or her responsibilities coherently with the other institutions, while showing, of course, the greatest possible consideration for the European general interest.
5160382 author: Annette Bauer:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, just a year ago, we reviewed EURussian relations and decided that the European Union should  despite our major differences with Russia over the conflict in Georgia  pursue cooperation with this major neighbour, including on the negotiation of the new agreement. We also concluded that we should base our relations on the assessment of our own selfinterest. The Stockholm Summit next week will therefore focus on areas  as has been said already  where there is mutual interest, for example, climate change and energy, and the global economic crisis.  The financial crisis has hit Russia hard, and this is precisely the kind of policy area in which the European Union also has a clear interest in seeking a common policy approach. The G 20  commitments were an important step in the right direction. I think it is important that they are now upheld by all partners. It is crucial, too, that Russia does not succumb to the temptations of protectionism. A tendency to protectionist practices is already hurting EU businesses.  Clearly, we believe that the best way forward is to work together in a rulesbased multilateral format. The summit will be an opportunity to again stress the importance of Russias WTO accession. Russias intention to complete negotiations in parallel with Belarus and Kazakhstan, with which it is planning a customs union, still leaves many questions unanswered. At the same time, we hope to get a better understanding of Russias new approach at the summit. This is important, not least in the context of the ongoing negotiations for the new agreement which are being held by the Commission and which must contain clear, legally binding provisions on trade and investment and also on energy.  The summit should also provide definitive clarity as to the conditions concerning bilateral trade from  1  January  2010  onwards under the new common external tariff system of the customs union.  Turning to climate change, my colleague has already said that the summit should underline the leading roles that Russia and the European Union can play together in achieving results at the Copenhagen meeting. Russia has the scope to make a very substantial contribution, given its enormous scope for emissions reductions through improvements in energy efficiency. We will therefore be calling on Russia to commit itself to more ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, comparable with the targets we have set ourselves in the EU.  On energy security, work continues on an enhanced early warning mechanism. We regret Russias withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), but we recall that the principles of the ECT were affirmed under Russias presidency of the G 8 , for instance, in the St Petersburg Declaration. These should therefore form the basis of our work on energy security under the new EURussia agreement. While we should be ready to discuss Russias wish for a wider debate on international energy security architecture, I think we will also want, above all, to establish the essentials of our bilateral energy relationship.  While we work well with Russia on many aspects of international relations, we need to make more progress in our cooperation in the common neighbourhood. We will therefore continue to explain our view that the political and economic stability encouraged by the Eastern Partnership is, finally, in the interests of all parties. We will continue to encourage Russia to work constructively for the resolution of the outstanding issues and conflicts, be they in Transnistria or NagornoKarabakh, and also through the Geneva process.  President Medvedevs proposal for a wider discussion of EuroAtlantic security has led to a new process of talks under the aegis of the OSCE. I think it is now important that this debate does not distract us from the immediate task of resolving todays frozen conflicts. The EURussia strategic partnership must  as was said before  be based on common commitments in the area of human rights and democracy. Russia has entered into commitments as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and these have to be upheld.  I think it is also crucial that we go further and work together on all the different issues. We know that the relationship between Russia and the EU is complex, but full of opportunities, and also has a vast potential. We will therefore pursue our principled course of critical, but also constructive, engagement with our neighbour, confident that Russia, too, knows its interests lie in maintaining a real strategic partnership with us.
6200850 author: Jennifer MacLeod:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, Russia is a strategic partner on the one hand but also a neighbour, and as a neighbour, it is more complicated. However, especially at a time of economic uncertainty, I think it is all the more important to ensure that the relationship between Europe and Russia works as effectively as possible to deliver security, stability and prosperity for our citizens and also for Russias citizens. We must therefore redouble our efforts to find common ground on issues where our views differ  for instance on human rights questions or on questions on the common neighbourhood  but also to keep the door open for dialogue and debate that respects our differences but also respects our common commitments. This is, so to say, the general line.  Now let me say a few very specific things. Russias WTO accession is, and remains, a key objective for us. In so saying, it is time to resolve several issues that remain outstanding in this trade relationship. Some of these, such as the Transnistrian overflight charges, have been on our agenda for many years. They have always been mentioned at the many summits I have been on. Others, such as the proposed decree limiting the transport of containers by road, are more recent, and I personally  and all the Commission services  raise these issues whenever we talk to Russia. Indeed, we just had a permanent partnership council, but of course, we could again do so.  The second item I want to mention is energy. The European Union and Russia are, as I said, also important partners in the energy field. The relation is one of interdependence, which offers both sides a strong motivation to put our energy relations on a predictable and also on a concrete basis. Ensuring an unhindered and uninterrupted energy supply to the European Union, thus preventing and overcoming emergency situations, is therefore of the utmost importance. This is what we aim to achieve with, for instance, the Early Warning Mechanism on which we are working and where it is important that we work with the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation. We have discussed this issue and I do hope that we can move on.  On Ukraine and, especially, the transit of gas, we at the Commission have been working with the Ukrainian authorities, but also with the international financial institutions, on a loan package that would address both payment difficulties for the storage of gas from Russia and the reform and modernisation of the Ukrainian gas sector.  An agreement was reached at the end of July, thus paving the way for financial assistance by the international financial institutions based on the implementation of a number of conditionalities. We hope that it will really work, and we also have to make sure that there is a very clear and transparent legal basis for the energy relationship. This is what we are aiming for, particularly in our new agreement.  With regard to human rights, I did speak about human rights. We have spoken about human rights whenever we have been at the summit. I would like to say a few words on the death penalty, because this is, of course, not acceptable for us according to our community of values. Yes, the constitutional court in Russia is debating this issue at the moment, but we were told that there are indications that the court will conclude that Russia is bound by its signature of Protocol  6  of the European Convention on Human Rights and thus, will most probably not apply the death penalty. Let us hope that this will indeed be true.  As I mentioned before, Russia itself has, as a member of the UN, as a member of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, entered into very important commitments on human rights. These are always discussed in our EURussia human rights consultations. As these just took place in Stockholm on  5  November, I did not go into any details, but everybody who is informed knows about that.  My last point is indeed a positive one: youth cooperation in science and technology. Yes, as Mr Fleckenstein mentioned, stimulating exchanges and cooperation between young people from the European Union and from Russia is a key concern for us and we are making our programmes available for this purpose. These have proven beneficial within the European Union itself, for instance, TEMPUS and Erasmus Mundus, and this is also an avenue we should continue to explore.  In this context again, we are launching the negotiation of Russias association to the European Community Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development. That is also an area of enormous economic potential.  I think again that the scope of our relationship is enormous. There is a lot to be discussed and we do not always see eye to eye with Russia, but we can always debate on every issue, and this is what we do.
2934762 author: Claire Green:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for putting forward this timely oral question, particularly also on behalf of my colleague, Charlie McCreevy, on the state of the implementation of the Services Directive.  It is a little less than two months before the implementation deadline, and it is a good time to look back on the work that has been done so far and to take stock of where things are today.  The Services Directive is one of the most important initiatives adopted in recent years. It has a great potential to remove barriers to trade in the internal market and to modernise our public administrations, and proper implementation becomes even more pressing in the current economic context. We know that very well and the European Parliament, and in particular, its Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, have not only played a key role in making its adoption possible but the Commission also particularly appreciated your continued interest in monitoring the work done by the Member States to implement the directive.  For our part, the Commission has delivered on its commitment to facilitate the implementation process. This was already mentioned. We have taken Member States requests for technical assistance seriously and we have deployed unprecedented efforts and resources to support their work. More than  80  bilateral meetings with all the Member States were held and expert groups met in Brussels over  30  times during the last three years.  But the Commission cannot carry out the implementation at national level. This is the role of Member States, and transposing the Services Directive has been a challenging task for them.  It has been challenging because it involved the carrying out of several largescale projects, such as the settingup of points of single contact and the review and simplification of legislation relating to services. It has been challenging also because it involved intensive coordination between all levels of the administration, be it at national, regional or local level.  So where do things stand today? And will Member States deliver?  Just over half of Member States seem to be in a position to achieve the implementation of the Services Directive by the end of  2009  deadline or in the beginning of  2010 . Some Member States might be late. This is not entirely satisfactory, in particular, for citizens and businesses wanting to make use of their rights in the internal market. Although the situation is not unusual compared to other internal market directives, it gives some reason for concern.  But it must also be taken into account that, perhaps more than for any other directive, Member States needed to address a huge amount of difficult legal and practical issues. And given this, the result that we hope to achieve by the beginning of next year may actually be considered as quite good.  Let me now reply in more detail to your question.  So, almost all Member States have completed the process of screening their national legislation. Some are still working on it. The extent to which the screening has contributed to an effective transposition of the directive is, of course, also somewhat difficult to assess at this stage. The transposition deadline has not yet expired, and Member States have not yet submitted their legislative changes to the Commission.  But it is clear that an ambitious and thorough process of screening is crucial to ensure the internal market friendliness of national legislation in each and every Member State. And it is also crucial for the competitiveness of our services sector in general.  As regards the points of single contact, it seems clear that most Member States will at least have basic, practical, pointofsinglecontact solutions in place by the end of  2009 . These will, again, not be totally perfect, but they should form a solid basis. Member States should continue developing and upgrading the points of single contact which, in the long run, should become fullyfledged egovernment centres.  In this context, the Commission agrees with the importance of providing additional information and procedures through the points of single contact, such as those related to workers rights and taxation. Businesses and consumers need to be aware of the applicable rules. But as you know, this is not mandatory under the directive.  We expect, as the points of single contact consolidate and develop, this information will also be provided. Indeed, some Member States are already planning to do so.  As regards the implementation of the directive in the area of social services  to the extent that they are covered by it  this does not seem to have raised particular problems. The directive itself contains mechanisms to ensure the specificities of these services are taken into account.  Finally, I think it is clear that stakeholders have played a vital role throughout the implementation process. They have followed Member States efforts closely and have been involved in implementation in different ways, and we will ensure that stakeholders are consulted next year during the evaluation of the results of the implementation.  So we need to find a method to ensure that this consultation is targeted and very concrete.  Finally, many Member States have had open consultation on the draft implementing legislation during the legislative process. Some stakeholder organisations have even organised regular surveys with their members on the state of implementation. Let us say it is important to be realistic and honest at this stage of the process. A lot still remains to be done in the area of implementation, and those Member States who are behind schedule need to make extra efforts.  I remain convinced, however, that the glass is more than half full. But we had better keep filling it and quickly.
8200884 author: Claire Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, as has been said before, we have discussed all the questions surrounding all the different social and other aspects of this directive. I do not think we should reopen this discussion now, but we do have to look to the Member States to see how they have implemented or will implement the directive. On the basis of the already available information, it does seem that a majority of Member States will have completed the implementation either by the end of the year or maybe the beginning of  2010 .  So I think one can also say that most Member States will at least have set up the basic single contact point and will therefore be ready to comply with their administrative cooperation agreements and obligations.  In some cases, however, there might be delays as far as the changes in the legal framework are concerned.  With regard to the review process, some Member States have taken the opportunity of the review to simplify laws and procedures and have made a considerable number of changes. Other Member States have enacted only a few amendments, and the number of changes made of course depends on several factors including the existing regulatory framework and also the internal organisation of Member States: in federal states, it is more complicated than for others.  Of course, this also depends on the willingness of a Member State to simplify laws and procedures.  With regard to the question of proper implementation, my colleague, Charlie McCreevy, has, on many occasions, drawn the attention of members of the Member States governments to the importance of the work on implementation, and he and his staff have followed and monitored the implementation process very closely.  Indeed, as I said before, during the last three years, more than  80  bilateral meetings with all the Member States were held, and expert groups met in Brussels over  30  times. So we have been very active on that. And we will continue to follow Member States work and will also continue to provide technical assistance if desired by the Member States. But in the end, it is also clearly the Member States responsibility to do the work and also allocate the necessary resources.  As regards next year, I think it will be crucial to ensure that the process of mutual evaluation provided for in the directive is used in a constructive way. We will also have to assess the quality of implementation of the legislation, as was asked, monitor the functioning of the single contact points and then also get feedback from businesses and from consumers.  Last but not least, we may also need to resort to other enforcement mechanisms  sometimes maybe to infringement cases, but it is too early now to say that.  On the small and mediumsized enterprises, of course, we are of the same opinion as you. They are the backbone of the EU economy and their concerns are at the heart of the Services Directive.  So this directive will benefit all businesses, but SMEs will benefit most, and at the present time, SMEs very often decide to stay at home because of all the legal complexities and also because of the absence of transparent information. Therefore, the Services Directive will do away with many of these complexities and  we all think  give a boost to them.  To the Commissions knowledge, no Member State is using the implementation of the Services Directive to reduce workers rights. I would like to say that very clearly. Workers rights as such are not affected or dealt with by the Services Directive. Indeed, this was clearly a result of the practical and political compromise reached by both Parliament and the Council.  Finally, I would like to reiterate that Parliament has been a key partner throughout the history of the Services Directive. Over the past three years, the Commission has found it important to keep you involved in the implementation process and informed about our work with the Member States and, as was mentioned earlier, this will remain a key action to making the internal market work better, to deliver the growth and jobs we need. Proper implementation is therefore the most pressing issue, especially in the current difficult economic crisis.
6232978 author: Annette White:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I am happy to have the opportunity today to address you in plenary session on the proposal for a regulation on origin marking. This is a proposal which honourable Members may recall the Parliament has been a strong supporter of since its adoption by the College as long ago as December  2005 . I particularly recall your resolution of July  2006  and the written declaration of September  2007 . I was privileged to discuss this issue last month in Strasbourg with a group of MEPs who stressed to me the need to move rapidly to adopt this regulation.  I think honourable Members would agree that it is of fundamental importance that trade policy not only strengthens the opportunities that open markets can offer but also addresses the concerns globalisation generates not just for consumers, but also, and perhaps particularly, for small enterprises.  Origin marking should therefore be considered in that spirit. In the  2007  declaration, you emphasised the right of European consumers to have clear and immediate information about their purchases. That is precisely what this regulation is about. It aims to allow EU consumers to be fully aware of the country of origin of the products that they purchase.  The Commission has proposed a compulsory indication of the country of origin of certain products imported into the European Union from third countries. Not all products are covered  we focused on those of real interest, following a broad consultation with consumers and with industry.  Origin marking, I might add, is fully in line with the current WTO rules and principles and something that exists almost everywhere in the world. Imports into the United States, into Canada, China and Japan are subject to country of origin marking. As a matter of fact, most products that you can currently purchase in shops in the European Union already bear the country of origin mark, as most legal systems currently require it. This means, of course, that for the vast majority of businesses, an obligation to mark products exported to the European Union will entail no additional cost.  Since  2006 , discussions have been held in Council in order to reach an agreement on the Commission proposal. A number of Member States remain to be convinced. They are worried that the administrative burden and the costs of an origin marking scheme may outweigh the benefits.  We have taken due note of those concerns, and we have recently presented concrete options that we believe address those issues. This is not a new formal proposal; it is an attempt to find common ground and reach a compromise. A Commission options paper was discussed with the Member States in the Article  133  Committee on  23  October  2009 .  First of all, the Commission asked the Member States to consider the option of narrowing the product coverage  so as to include only endconsumer goods. The original list contained some intermediate products, such as raw skin and certain textiles, that are not of direct interest to the consumer. The Commission suggests now to include only those goods that consumers can find in retail stores.  Secondly, the Commission suggested that the scheme be launched on a pilot project basis. Any continuation would be subject to an evaluation of the impact the proposed scheme had. This would allow for an assessment of the impact on cost and on price  it may also, of course, give some indication of how we could modify the product coverage of the regulation.  I am pleased to say that the Member States have received our options paper with interest. Although not all doubts have been resolved and several Member States have maintained their opposition in principle to this proposal, they are ready to study the issue further and the work will continue over the next few weeks at both experts meetings level and in the Article  133  Committee. I sincerely hope this will clear the way for a compromise solution.  As honourable Members know, the new Article  207  of the Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament new and increased authority on legislative measures in the field of trade policy  and the made in regulation could be one of the first to appear on honourable Members desks.  I am therefore very interested in keeping you closely involved in the further discussions on this important subject, and look forward to our brief debate now.
3296081 author: Philip Whittacker:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to what is an important debate on this issue.  If I might begin with Ms Muscardinis particular points  the feeling that this has dragged on for some time. In my time as a Commissioner, I have been very conscious of talking with Member States about the issues that they are most concerned with and have tried to react when I could see an issue of importance. But, as other Members have said, the reality of political life is that I have to get any proposal through the Council. That means  when it is clear that there is not a solid majority for a particular idea  thinking again about what it is that might make the difference between failing to get something through, where clearly there is a very strong set of views, and success.  It seemed to me that we had the opportunity, by refining what we were describing in order to address the concerns that Member States had, to promote this yet again, because it still rests within the Commission. Especially when a Commission is coming to the end of its life and is now, of course, beyond  some might say  the end of its life, it is important to reflect back on what has not yet been completed.  I cannot give time guarantees; I would like to, but I am in the hands of the Council inevitably on that. But I do make my commitment to carry on with this, because there is a strength of feeling. I will come on to what I think and why I think that is so important.  A number of honourable Members have raised the particular issues about consumers and the opportunity that this would afford for transparency and clarity  to give information to consumers. I think even Adam Smith was quoted in that. It is important that, if you are going to have free trade in the world, you also have to have clarity and transparency for consumers to make the kinds of choices that go alongside free trade. Those concepts go hand in hand, and I would agree with that. Therefore, I think that those honourable Members who raised that point actually get to the heart of what this is trying to do.  It is not about protectionism. This happens all over the world. For most of the countries from which one would buy the kind of products we have listed, you already know where you buy from. As a consumer myself, it matters to me to know where the product is made. I think for many consumers this has been an important part of the way in which they interact with the market. The opportunity to say that we will make sure that we have that transparency, I would argue, is very important. We should not be frightened of it, because, if we are frightened of it, there is something wrong. The point about openness and free trade and transparency is that you face that and actually deal with it appropriately.  Specifically, Mr Schlyter asked me about the expanding of the list. Well, it is subject to further discussion: there is not a final list at all. We have simply tried to put forward what we believe is a realistic list but are very comfortable in actually discussing that further.  I think that it is only right that I also address the concerns that have been raised about whether we are being ambitious enough. Mr Arif said that we should not water this down. Of course  but I am not trying to water down; I am trying to be realistic. If, in the end, I have a proposal that I simply do not have the capacity to put through the Council, I think it is beholden on me to look again and ask whether there are there things we could do, not to water down but to recognise the legitimate concerns and see whether we can put this through, perhaps in a pilot model or a more narrow model in order to test that what I say is true and in order that we can then hopefully broaden out later, because we have actually got an understanding of what it is we are trying to do.  We are looking at the whole Euromed issues as well. That is part of the discussion, as you know, that is currently going on. I also take the point about what we are trying to do in terms of protection of jobs. Honourable Members will know that I have made much about the difference between protectionism and support for industry, support for jobs and consumers and so on. We have got to be clear that trade is not about ignoring all of those things. They go hand in hand.  Mr Fjellner, I have got to deal with your particular point, because you described what I was doing as an improper way of acting. I am not quite sure how parliamentary it is in the European Parliament to describe somebody as behaving improperly, but let me assure that I am not seeking in any way to do that. It is not about any link to anything. What I tried to do while I was talking to Member States about all of these aspects of trade was to pick up, either by the work I had been doing  and specifically, talking to small businesses across Europe, where I have a great concern that they should have real opportunities so that more than  3  of them will start trading beyond the European Union  issues that are either left over  things that we have not resolved one way or the other  or indeed where countries feel particularly strongly.  This is not the only issue, by any means, but it did occur to me that this is an opportunity to try and bring this back. It is about the level playing field. It is about clarity and transparency for consumers. It is about saying that we need to move forward. I hope Parliament will engage with this and help refine this further so that we actually have something extremely positive to take back.  Very finally, I was asked specifically about the question of made in the European Union. We did consult industry and consumers on that. It did not find favour. There was a concern that that would be expensive. It was not what was being looked for and so we have not pursued that.
4589287 author: Mary Merx:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, today is the culmination of what has been a very long, and very often intense, legislative process, and the efforts shown by all sides in the negotiations have produced results which were worth waiting for. I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the committee chairs, the President and the members of the Conciliation Committee, and all the individual Members of Parliament who have brought their commitment and expertise to bear.  With the adoption of the reform package as it now stands, the Union will have a regulatory framework that is fit to meet the challenges of a rapidly developing digital economy based on fair prices for all to get telephone and internet connections, while preparing the ground for investments in highspeed networks delivering highquality, innovative services.  These rules, these reforms, will make the European Union a global leader in the regulation of electronic communications, not just by improving the mechanism to move towards a competitive single market, but also by putting the rights of the citizens at the heart of a regulatory policy.  The compromise reached in conciliation lays down for the first time in EU law the fundamental rights of internet users against measures that could limit their internet access. This is a very important internet freedom provision. It makes clear that the internet, which is becoming more and more central to our daily lives, should be subject to the same safeguards for our fundamental rights as other areas of activity. Prior, fair procedures, with the presumption of innocence and the right to privacy, followed by the right to effective and timely judicial review: those are the rules which have been put into the new reform package.  At the same time, the reform package enshrines the vision of an open and mutual internet as an objective of regulatory policy. The EU approach is a very pragmatic one. It has, by the way, already been hailed on other continents as an important trendsetter.  The protection of consumers against loss of personal data and against spam has also been strengthened, particularly by requiring operators to notify consumers in case of personal data breaches and by strengthening the principle of user consent when it comes to use of cookies. Amongst other major gains for consumers is the right to change their fixed or mobile operator in one working day while keeping their old phone number.  Thanks to Parliament, the new provisions on radio spectrum will bring lower prices and encourage the introduction of new services, thereby helping to bridge the digital divide. Parliament will have a key role in setting the strategic direction for spectrum policy at European level through the new multiannual radio spectrum policy programme. The reforms will also permit investment by operators in the nextgeneration networks. They will strengthen the incentives to invest efficiently in new infrastructure by taking account of the investment risks, while ensuring that competition is not stifled.  At institutional level, the body of European regulators, the famous BEREC, offers the opportunity for the  27  national regulators to contribute to the functioning of the single market in a more transparent and effective manner. The strengthened oversight of remedies by the Commission, supported by BEREC, will consolidate the single market by improving the consistency and the quality of implementation of the framework across Europe and ensure that operators have a level playing field.  Let us not forget the important agreement reached on Article  19  of the framework directive, which gives the Commission enhanced harmonisation powers covering general regulatory approaches, including in relation to remedies. This gives the Commission a central role, in cooperation with BEREC, to ensure that the Telecoms Regulation is applied consistently in the single market in the interests of citizens and businesses.  I already presented to you my declarations at the May plenary, saying that the Commission will build on the reforms by consulting widely next year on the scope of the future universal service and a wider application of the principles relating to data breach notification. I reaffirm these commitments today, adjusted of course only to the time that has elapsed since then.  The Commission will also do its part to ensure that the new tools are put to good use when needed. I have indicated that the Commission will monitor the impact of market and technological developments on net freedoms and report to the European Parliament and the Council before the end of  2010  on whether additional guidance is required. The Commission will also invoke its existing competition law powers to deal with any anticompetitive practices that may emerge.  I believe that the confidence and the legal certainty provided by these reforms will be critical in helping the ecommunications sector to contribute to Europes economic recovery. I would therefore commend Parliament for its support for the package and urge Members to vote in favour of its adoption.  (Applause)
5447268 author: Michael Reid:  deputising for the rapporteur.  Mr President, for once in my life, that was good timing! Can I take this opportunity first of all to apologise for my colleague, Timothy Kirkhope, who is unable to be here. What I am about to do is to read the wise wisdom of all his words that he has thought out and put on paper. I will read his views as rapporteur to you. He is the rapporteur of the two reports of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.  Firstly, I would like to focus on Timothys report on the draft Council Decision adopting the rules on the confidentiality of Europol information. The rules to be established are to apply security measures to all information which is processed by, or through, Europol: in other words, a common standard for protection of information that passes through communication channels between Europol and the national units of Member States.  Along with his fellow rapporteurs for the Europol package, they have endured a frustrating time negotiating the timescale and legality of the draft Council Decisions. Following President Klauss signature and therefore the Treaty of Lisbon becoming a reality, the negotiations with the Council and Commission have become obsolete. This report, along with his colleagues reports, calls for a rejection of the Council text.  He would like to make it clear that he supports the aim of the Council Decision, as we are in favour of better exchange of information, and recognise the benefits Europol brings to Member States regarding law enforcement and crime fighting.  We would like to keep Europols remit and scope small and specific and thereby make the agency as efficient and effective as possible. We also need to recognise that sovereign states have their role to play in that they control their national police forces and security services. However, without prejudice to the overall support of the European Police Office, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and its effects on police cooperation, the rapporteur, and his fellow rapporteurs in the LIBE Committee, feel that there should be no amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision until such measures can be adopted under the new legal framework provided by the Treaty of Lisbon.  We therefore call on the Council to withdraw its proposal and, as stated in the report, call on the Commission or the Council to make a declaration in plenary on a proposal for a new Europol decision, which shall be submitted six months following the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.  Now I would like to turn to the second report on the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain for the adoption of a Council framework decision on accreditation of forensic laboratory activities. This is an initiative of Sweden and Spain on ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body in order to combat crime through closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities in the Member States. Over the last couple of years, information exchange in the area of judicial and lawenforcement cooperation has become a high priority for the European Union and its Member States in the crimeprevention and crimefighting potential.  The purpose of this draft framework decision is to ensure that the results of laboratory activities in one Member State are recognised as being equivalent to the results of laboratory activities in other Member States, thereby guaranteeing legal certainty to the suspects and improved judicial cooperation where evidence of one Member State is used in proceedings in another Member State.  This purpose is achieved by ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body to comply with international standards. The framework decision would apply to laboratory activities relating to DNA and fingerprints, and each Member State ensures that the results of the accredited laboratory activities carried out in other Member States are recognised as equivalent to the results of the accredited domestic laboratory activities. However, it will, of course, always remain the responsibility of each individual judicial authority to assess any evidence, forensic or not, in accordance with its own national law.  Again, I would like to stress that we support the aims of the Councils framework decision. However, again, there are problems regarding the legal basis of this initiative with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The report therefore calls for a rejection of the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain. The legal clarity regarding LIBE reports is unclear in light of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. This report will be submitted at a later date under a legal basis that is clear. We would suggest that this would allow this important subject to be examined in more detail, as, again, the timetable imposed was very short and did not afford Parliament the time it would have wanted on such an important subject.
2300544 author: Katarina Bush:  rapporteur.  Mr President, thank you firstly for your tolerance and for your presence.  When I first stood for the European Parliament in  1984 , I remarked to one of my then colleagues, Ken Collins, a Scottish Member, that I was wondering whether I was doing the wrong thing, because Parliament did not seem to have much teeth when it came to legislative matters. Ken said to me that it was true that Parliament did not have a lot of teeth, but, if you asked any mother of a young baby, you would know that you can make a big impression with your gums.  This Parliament did make a big impression with its gums in terms of using the right to be consulted on legislation. Since then, we have had the Single European Act, which took the European Parliament from being a baby to infanthood, Maastricht which took us through puberty, the Nice and the Amsterdam Treaties, which took us into adulthood, and now the Lisbon Treaty, which I believe takes this Parliament into the full rights of an adult Parliament, comparable to any other democratic institution in the European Union.  I am honoured to have the opportunity to present a report adjusting our Rules of Procedure to take into account the new powers we have as a result of the Lisbon Treaty.  I am honoured, but to be honest, I am also slightly disappointed, because this report should really be called the Corbett report. My colleague, Richard Corbett, did all the hard work on this report before the elections. He made it very easy for me in terms of the Lisbon aspects of the report. Although we have had controversy over the nonLisbon aspects of the report, Richard Corbett did an excellent job in terms of the Lisbon aspects and I really only had to pick up the baton.  The report prepares us for the new powers we get on trade policy, where we now have full assent along with the Council on all trade matters, and our new powers in terms of agriculture and fishing, where we now have codecision. It also refines our role in the appointment of the European Commission, establishes a new relationship between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, and paves the way for new Members of this Parliament.  Most of these issues have been dealt with, as I have said, without controversy. Let me just briefly mention where we have some disagreements between the groups, though I should say in passing that the political groups have shown excellent cooperation over this matter. All the major shadows and coordinators have been very supportive, but there are one or two issues that we have not been able to resolve.  Firstly, who should chair our delegation to COSAC? Should it be the Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs or should it be a vicepresident of Parliament, as is presently the situation? My own view is that it should be a vicepresident; the committee has decided that it should be the Chair. In the end, the plenary will decide, but I make the point that COSAC is about more than interinstitutional relations. It also deals with policy matters and that is why historically, we have had a vicepresident chairing the delegation.  In terms of our relationship with the national parliaments, we have had some disagreement in the committee on how much detail we should go into, and how much the rules should prescribe that relationship. I have managed to reach a compromise with Mr Brok, who has been very accommodating in this matter, which lays down some detail but which still leaves enough room for the President of Parliament to negotiate with his counterparts in the national parliaments the exact modalities of how we will cooperate with the national parliaments.  A third issue where there has been some controversy is how to deal with the principle of subsidiarity. We have settled quite easily the role that the committees will play in this matter, and there is consensus around that. The only point that has emerged is what happens if a committee says no, there is no breach of subsidiarity and the legislation should go ahead. Should there be a safety valve for Members of the European Parliament to raise the matter on the floor of this House? I have put down an amendment, and others have put down similar amendments, suggesting that if one tenth of the Members of the European Parliament reckon there is an issue of subsidiarity, then that matter should be debated on the floor of the House. I think that is a sensible safety valve.  The last issue that I want to mention is the issue of observers, and whether we should have observers in advance of the  18  new Members taking their seats. My view is that we absolutely should. However, the crucial issue  and, again, there is consensus in the committee on this  is whether these observers should be people who would otherwise have been elected to Parliament. That is critical for our credibility. If we allow the Member States simply to appoint anyone to take the role of observer  and we do have rumours that some Member States want to appoint national parliamentarians  I think that would be entirely unacceptable.  I conclude by saying that I am pleased that this Parliament, by its vote this week, will have in place on  1  December, from the minute the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, a set of rules allowing us to exercise our new powers immediately. That is to the credit of the people who worked in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs before the summer, and I again repeat my thanks to Richard Corbett for all the efforts that he made in this regard.  (Applause)
8995422 author: Amy White:  on behalf of the EFD Group.  Mr President, you are all very downbeat this morning. I thought this was going to be a big, proud moment! It has taken you eight and a half years of bullying, of lying, of ignoring democratic referendums. Eight and a half years it has taken you to get this treaty through, and on  1  December you will have it.  Of course, the architect of all of this, Giscard, wanted, from this constitutional treaty, for the European Union to have a big, global voice, but I am afraid the leaders have suffered from a collective loss of nerve. They have decided that they want their faces to be up on the global stage, not somebody from the European Union, and so we have got appointed a couple of political pygmies.  The Kissinger question of who to call in Europe has not really been answered, has it? I guess the answer can only be Mr Barroso, because he is the only one that anybody in the world has ever heard of and is probably the big winner out of these posts. No wonder, Sir, you look so happy this morning.  And we have a new president of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy. It does not exactly trip off the tongue, does it? I cannot see him stopping the traffic in Beijing or Washington; I doubt anybody in Brussels would even recognise who he is. And yet he is going to be paid a salary that is bigger than Obamas, which tells you all you need to know about this European political class and how they look after themselves.  But at least he is an elected politician, unlike Baroness Cathy Ashton, who really is the true representation of the modernday political class. In some ways she is ideal, is she not? She has never had a proper job, and she has never been elected to anything in her life. So I guess she is perfect for this European Union.  (The President asked the speaker to conclude)  She has never been elected to anything and no one knows who she is! Even the Prime Minister was talking about Baroness Ashdown as opposed to Ashton. I mean, no one has ever heard of her. She is even less wellknown than Herman Van Rompuy! I mean, that takes some doing, does it not?  She has risen without trace. She is part of this postdemocratic age. She married well: she married an adviser, friend and supporter of Tony Blair and got put in the House of Lords. When she was in the House of Lords, she was given one big job, and that job was to get the Lisbon Treaty through the House of Lords and to do so pretending that it was entirely different to the EU Constitution. So she is good at keeping a straight face, and she vigorously crushed any attempt in the House of Lords for the British people to have a referendum.  So here she is: never stood for public office, never had a proper job, and here she gets one of the top jobs in the Union. Her appointment is an embarrassment for Britain.  (Interjection from the floor)  Well, at least I have been elected, Sir, unlike her! She has not been elected, and the people do not have the power to remove her.  But just hear the next bit. There is something rather more serious than that. Cathy Ashton was an active member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. In fact, she was the treasurer of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during a period of time when CND took very large donations and refused to reveal the source. What is known is that these donations were obtained by a man called Will Howard, who was a member of the Communist Party in Great Britain. Will Baroness Ashton deny that, while she was treasurer, she took funds from organisations that were opposed to Westernstyle capitalism and democracy? That question must be asked.  And are we really happy that somebody who will be in charge of our overseas security policy was an activist a few years ago in an outfit like CND? If we really think that, frankly, we need our bumps felt! I do not think she is a fit and proper person to do this job. She has no experience and she must answer those questions. Did she take money from enemies of the West? That question must be answered.  Well, we have our two pygmies. We will have the bland leading the bland, but I am not celebrating because they will press on with political union and, whilst our leaders may have saved face for the moment for themselves on the international stage, they have all betrayed their national democracies. The European state is here. We are about to get an avalanche of new laws because of this Lisbon Treaty and there is no question in my mind that there has to be a full, free, fair referendum in the United Kingdom to decide whether we stay part of this Union or not. I hope and pray that we vote to leave, but either way the people simply must be asked.  (The speaker agreed to take a bluecard question under Rule  149 ( 8 ))
2770907 author: Jennifer Green:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, there was this concrete issue on SWIFT and I want to clarify the position on that matter because I think it is extremely important. It also has to do with the Stockholm Programme.  The SWIFT Programme is, indeed, a very valuable instrument for Member States in their fight against terrorism. It has allowed Member States authorities to prevent terrorist attacks in Europe. We are not talking about theoretical cases. We are talking about actual cases.  The draft European UnionUnited States agreement, which is currently being discussed, is an interim arrangement with a maximum duration of  12  months. It is needed in order to legally replace the existing one after the move of the data storage out of the United States.  If the interim agreement is adopted before  1  December and the legal basis is changed, it will avoid a security gap and a serious blow to European UnionUnited States relations in this area.  In the recent meeting we had, involving the European Union and President Obama, the first issue he raised was the cooperation on the fight against terrorism between the United States and Europe. He gave us the names of concrete countries in Europe that escaped terrorist attacks recently because of the cooperation in this matter between us and them.  I can give you some data on that, if you wish. More than  5   450  cases under the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme have been passed to date to European governments, with over  100  new generated leads provided to European countries from January to September this year.  I can give you concrete examples. This information has provided substantial assistance to European governments during the investigation into the alQaedadirected plot to attack transatlantic airline flights travelling between the UK and the United States.  In midSeptember  2009 , three individuals were convicted, and each was sentenced to at least  30  years in prison. In early  2009 , this system was used to identify the financial activity of a Europebased alQaeda individual who played a role in the planning of an alleged attack on aircraft. The information was passed to the governments of European and Middle Eastern nations.  In summer  2007 , the same system was used to identify the financial activities of Germanybased members of the Islamic Jihad Union. This information contributed to the investigation and eventual arrest of Islamic Jihad Union members who were plotting to attack sites in Germany. They subsequently confessed to these activities.  So, this system has already saved many lives in Europe and elsewhere. We are talking about an extremely serious matter. I fully agree that the whole fight against terrorism has to be done in the full respect of fundamental rights and guarantees of our open, free societies. We were the first in the world to say to President Bush that he needed to close Guantnamo  we Europeans. And we stand by it. At the same time, we have to see to it that we stay united and committed to the fight against terrorism.  That is why I want to give you all the assurance that we will present to you a new mandate on the basis of the new Treaty of Lisbon, precisely for addressing this issue, where the European Parliament will have its full powers.  So, in early  2010 , we will come with a new basis respecting the Lisbon Treaty that will, of course, give Parliament all the capacity to act in this matter because we want Parliament to also be at the forefront of this action against terrorism and for security, by fully respecting, of course, our fundamental rights and our legal guarantees.  Finally, since so many of you spoke  and I thank you for your comments  on the issue of gender balance, which is so important for me, for the Commission and for the European institutions, let me signal the fact that today is the  10 th anniversary of the international day for the elimination of violence against women. I think this is an agenda where we also have to do something in Europe. Unfortunately, there are still many cases in Europe where women are affected by attacks by their male companions or former companions. I want to use this opportunity to show our commitment to this very important agenda which is also in our European society.
4707824 author: Marc Merx:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, on this same day that we are celebrating the fact that the next Commission will apparently have at least nine women  and I also see that as a victory for all of us who have actively fought for this  we hear from news reports this morning that, in France alone,  156  women were killed last year by domestic violence. As this is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, this is something that should make us stop and think and, hopefully, also act in the future at European level, as well as at international level. Perhaps we should also bring this up in different meetings during the rest of today.  This is an important step forward. It also says a lot about the procedure from now on, which should be more open when we appoint Commissioners. I hope that, in the future, Member States and governments will nominate both a man and a woman. I think that is an excellent idea.  Let me also comment on the appointments of a new High Representative and a new Council President. Mrs Cathy Ashton was nominated to the Commission with the full confidence of the UK Government. She was actually voted for here in the Parliament a year ago with a very large majority  with  538  votes, if I am correct. As we have heard from several of you, she has been working very closely with Parliament and has always looked for Parliaments involvement on different issues. She was appointed unanimously by  27  Heads of State or Government, so I think she has all the legitimacy to fulfil her job and to gain the respect of the European Unions foreign partners. I liked the metaphor that was presented here that instead of having somebody who would stop the traffic, or mean red traffic lights, you would have a smooth operator, somebody that would actually help the traffic flow or decisions to be made in a democratic and good way in the European Union. I have got to know her as a very good colleague, and I would say that she is also a convinced European. That is indeed an important starting point.  We have already had good comments in the debate here. I think it has been a fruitful and constructive discussion, and thanks for all your contributions. May I also comment on the direct question by Gran Frm about the budget review. I can only repeat what the Commission President has already told you, that this will be handed over to the new Commission. This is firstly because the new Lisbon Treaty will contain provisions that require a new institutional setup, so it will also have a good basis for decisions on the budget. Secondly, the new Commission will have to decide on the political priorities and then put its money where its mouth is in order to actually have the budget to accompany the political priorities. I would say that is an important innovation and an opportunity for the next Commission. It will also be handed over to Cecilia Malmstrm with warm hands from all of us. What the Commission can say is that a proposal for the budget review will come early next year and will be the immediate task for the next Commission.  I would just like to comment on one thing concerning the Stockholm Programme. The adoption of the Stockholm Programme coincides with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, where the European Parliament will have a crucial role in the development of these policies. This will again increase the democratic legitimacy of the important decisions to be taken on justice and home affairs issues. This is good news for European citizens and also for all EU institutions.  On climate change, I can hear that there is a common view here on the active role that the European Union should play in Copenhagen and from now on.  So, again, thank you very much for the debate. With the new Lisbon Treaty, we now have a text that will help us deal with all the important issues that have been raised here  climate change, fighting the financial crisis and its social and other effects  and, of course, also make sure that we have a democratic European Union in the future.
10466948 author: Victor McNabb:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Mr President, honourable Members, this is a truly important debate on a truly important subject. Still, if I wished, I could limit my intervention today to just saying that the Presidency is in full agreement with the motion for a resolution that has been put forward by Mr Albertini on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. It is important that Parliament and the Council, as well as the Commission, stand together on an issue as critical as this one.  In retrospect, perhaps the most crucial of all the Articles in that treaty that was signed on the Capitol Hill in Rome more than half a century ago was what today is Article  49  in the Lisbon Treaty: any European state which respects our values and is committed to promoting them may apply to become a member of the Union.  It is by this that  19  of the countries of our Union today have become members and part of the historic undertaking of our Union. It is by this Article that we have managed to promote peace and prosperity and further the rule of law and representative government in ever larger parts of this once so conflictridden part of the world.  Sometimes you need to go to other parts of the world, as I have the duty to do quite often, to be reminded of how enormous this achievement really is.  During more than half a century, our Europe exported wars and totalitarian ideologies across the rest of the globe. Two world wars; two totalitarian ideologies; strife and suffering.  Now, we are instead exporting the idea of peaceful reconciliation, of integration across old borders, of common rules and regulations as the common way to better governance. Add to this all that has been achieved by Article  49  and it also makes our Union stand taller in the world.  A Europe of  6 , of  9 , of  12 , of  15  or even of  25  would have been smaller in every single respect  in ambition, in standing, in possibilities, in respect across the globe.  Your resolution is surely right to say that enlargement, and I quote, has proven to be one of the most successful of all European Union policies. This is, if anything, an understatement.  We all know that the process has not been entirely easy. I remember coming in a different capacity to an earlier European Parliament representing a country seeking accession and also meeting those who feared that further enlargement from the then  12  would risk diluting the political ambitions of the Union.  There have been both the difficulties of the new members implementing our ever increasing policies and acquis and our difficulties in adjusting to our own success in the form of new members, but when we look back, it is easy to see that periods of enlargement have been periods in which we have also deepened our cooperation.  During the past two decades, we have more than doubled the number of Member States and, in rapid succession, we got the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon. The previous three decades did not even succeed in fully implementing the Treaty of Rome.  Article  49  is as important, I would argue, to our future as it has been to our past. Our magnetism is still there. During the last year, we have had new membership applications from Montenegro, Albania and Iceland, and there are others that we all know that are equally keen on reaching the position where an application can be handed in.  After the last enlargement that brought in approximately  100  million new citizens to our Union, our attention is now focused on the countries of southeastern Europe  perhaps up to  100  million citizens as well.  This will be neither fast nor easy. The different challenges we face in the different countries of the western Balkans are well known, and the magnitude of the transformation of Turkey has not escaped us either.  We are all aware that there are those in our respective public opinions that would prefer just to shut the door to all of them, hoping that the issue will go away, and who opt for a more closed idea of Europe.  I belong to those who are convinced that this would be a mistake of historic proportions, the consequences of which would haunt our Europe for a very long time to come.  Their door to our Union might sometimes be a very distant one. Some of them will have to travel a long and difficult road of reforms, but, were that door to be shut, other doors would immediately open up to other forces, and we might well see those parts of Europe moving off in directions which, over time, will have negative consequences for us all.  That is why Article  49  remains of such fundamental importance. It is the beacon of reform and reconciliation that also inspires and guides the regions of Europe that are not yet members of our Union.  Commissioner Rehn will go into more details concerning the Commissions assessment of the progress of all these countries concerned, and the Presidency does share the assessment made by the Commission.  It remains our ambition to move all of the countries of the western Balkans forward in the accession process, knowing that they are at very different stages of it. We expect, somewhat related to this, a decision to be taken that from  19  December, there will be visafree access to our Union for the citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. That is a major and most important step forward.  Along with Parliament, we share the hope that Albania and Bosnia will catch up and will be able to join this most important step as soon as possible.  The accession process of Croatia has been unblocked and is now moving forward. This is important for Croatia and for the entire region. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been given a very positive report by the Commission, and it is my hope that the Council in December will be able to concretely indicate further steps in its accession process.  The applications of Montenegro and Albania have been forwarded to the Commission and I believe we can expect its opinion within a year or so.  In Bosnia, it is our hope that the political leaders will be able to agree on the reforms necessary in order to make it possible for that country as well to contemplate an application for membership. Indirect talks facilitated by the European Union and the United Sates in close cooperation are under way as we speak today.  Serbia has been making good progress on its unilateral implementation of the interim agreement, and we will obviously look very carefully at the upcoming report by the ICTY Chief Prosecutor concerning its cooperation with its efforts. It is our hope that he is satisfied with the current level of efforts, although it is, of course, also critical that these efforts are maintained.  Moving further to the southeast, I would like to pay tribute to the fundamental reforms under way in Turkey on the Kurdish question. The success of these would bring the country much closer to our European standards in areas of fundamental importance.  There are numerous other issues which I think the Commissioner will go into. Not directly related but also of obvious significance in this regard are the ongoing talks between President Christofias and Mr Talat on the reunification of Cyprus. We can only urge them to move forward towards a comprehensive solution on the basis of a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The importance of this can hardly be exaggerated.  We will move either towards a new era of reconciliation and cooperation in this part of Europe and the entire region of the eastern Mediterranean, or towards a situation where it is easy to see that we will be faced with rapidly mounting problems.  Much of our attention is on the challenges of southeastern Europe, but the application of Iceland is adding to the reasons we have to focus more of our attention on all the issues of the Arctic and the wider high North. This is an area where our Union must also be more present and engaged in the future. Its importance is coming more and more into the focus of all the significant global actors and the application of Iceland should also be seen from that perspective.  With a democratic tradition that reaches back a thousand years or so, and with its membership in our single market through the European Economic Area, it is obvious that Iceland has already travelled quite a bit on the road to membership, although we will have to assess the further progress when we get the avis from the Commission.  Mr President, this is what the Swedish Presidency has so far managed to achieve in the important area of enlargement. We still have some important weeks in which I expect further progress, but let me conclude by saying that I do not believe that we have completed the building of our Europe. I do believe that we must remain an open Europe and that we should remain committed to an enlargement process that brings good governance, the rule of law, reconciliation, peace and prosperity to larger and larger parts of our Europe.  This is obviously of key importance to them, but we should recognise that it is of key importance to us as well, and let us not forget that it will also make it possible for us to stand taller in the world and for our voice to demand even greater respect in the future.
2204412 author: Amy Bush:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, let me first thank the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and its Chair, Gabriele Albertini, for a balanced and comprehensive resolution. I would also like to thank all of you for your excellent cooperation over the past five years. The European Parliament has greatly helped to shape our enlargement policy and you have set an example of democratic accountability. I look forward to continuing our excellent cooperation in the future, whatever the portfolio in my case.  The EU will take a longawaited step forward next week when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force. This will start a new era in the EUs foreign policy. Indirectly, it will also cement the EUs renewed consensus on enlargement based on the three Cs of consolidation, conditionality and communication, combined with an approved capacity to integrate new members. This will enable us to continue our gradual and carefully managed accession process.  As your draft resolution illustrates, enlargement is one of the EUs most powerful foreign policy tools today. This was also the spirit of Carl Bildts message, and I do agree with this message based on empirical evidence during the Swedish Presidency and over the years and decades. It is also true that the EUs credibility as a global actor stands or falls by our ability to shape our very own neighbourhood. It is here that we have achieved our most remarkable successes over the past  20  years of transforming the European continent by reunifying East and West and thus building a stronger European Union.  Enlargement has been a key driver of this process and it continues to transform southeastern Europe today. Albanias and Montenegros applications for EU membership underscore the Unions continued power of attraction. Icelands application adds a new political and geoeconomic dimension to our enlargement agenda. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are both considering submitting an application. Given the economic crisis, all these countries might easily have turned inwards. Instead, they continue to pursue European orientation with all the tough choices and bold reforms this entails. Croatia is nearing the finishing line after four years of intense accession negotiations. Zagreb now needs to intensify its reform efforts, especially in the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organised crime, so that negotiations can be concluded. ICTY cooperation remains a must.  We have seen steady progress in Turkey as well. Turkey plays a key role in energy security and in the dialogue between civilisations. Ankaras commitment to normalise relations with Armenia is historic, as is the democratic opening to resolve the Kurdish question, but Turkey still has a long way to go. Besides reforms, we expect Turkey to ensure full implementation of the Ankara Protocol and to make progress towards the normalisation of relations with Cyprus.  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made convincing progress recently and substantially addressed the key reform priorities. The country sufficiently fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria. These factors enabled the Commission to recommend the opening of accession negotiations. I have the impression that the government in Skopje has rightly seen our recommendation as an encouragement to finally settle the name issue with Greece. There is now a new context, a new debate and a new window of opportunity that I trust both Skopje and Athens will indeed capitalise on.  There has been good news in Serbia too. Belgrade has demonstrated its commitment to EU integration, not least by implementing the interim agreement with the EU unilaterally, and I assume that the ICTY should now be satisfied with Serbias efforts. I agree with your draft resolution to unblock the agreement. It is high time to allow Serbia to move to the next stage of its European journey.  Bosnia and Herzegovina presents its own serious challenges, partly due to its wartime history, but let me be clear that there can be no discounts in EU enlargement. Bosnias application for EU membership can only be considered once the OHR has closed. Bosnia also needs to undertake constitutional changes in part to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Respect for human rights is a founding principle of the European Union. Together with the Presidency and the United States, we have proposed a package of reforms to achieve this. I hope, for the sake of the citizens and for the region as a whole, that the Bosnian leaders will rise to the occasion and reach an agreement. The EU and the US are engaged at the highest levels because we want Bosnia to succeed, and I believe it can succeed.  As for Kosovo, stability has been maintained but still remains fragile. The Commission has presented a study on how to promote Kosovos socioeconomic development and anchor it to Europe. We identify eventual visa facilitation and trade as flagships once the conditions have been met.  To conclude, we set out together an ambitious but, in retrospect, realistic agenda five years ago when I started my mandate as Enlargement Commissioner. During my hearings, I told this Parliament that by  2009 , we wanted to see an EU of  27  Member States with Bulgaria and Romania in, the accession process with Croatia reaching its final stage, the other Western Balkan countries anchored in the EU through association agreements, Turkey firmly on a European track, Kosovos status settled and Cyprus reunified. I am glad and proud that, with the important exception of Cyprus, where settlement talks are still ongoing, nearly all our ambitions have materialised. We have worked together for these very worthy goals and together we have made a difference. Even Cyprus might still happen, to the benefit of all of its citizens and the European Union.  Besides, though I hoped for it, I did not dare to forecast progress on visa liberalisation five years ago. Yet here we are, one month away from turning the dream of the citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into reality. We hope to do the same for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina next year once they meet the conditions.  It is therefore a very important reminder to all of us who work with southeastern Europe of how attractive the European dream remains for millions of citizens in our immediate neighbourhood. Let us keep that dream alive and, in time, make it a reality.
6976742 author: Sarah Corless:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Madam President, let me try to be brief.  First, if this is appropriate from the Presidency point of view, I join those Members who have paid tribute to Commissioner Rehn for the work that he has done over the past five years. Much has been achieved. It may be good for your successor that there is still something left to do, but much has been done.  I also express our appreciation for the very broad support for the policy of enlargement that has been expressed throughout this debate by all of the representatives of all of the major political factions here. I think that is a source of strength.  (Interjection from William (The Earl of) Dartmouth: Did you listen to the debate?)  I did listen to the debate. You are not part of one of the major groups. I am sorry about that.  Mr Severin was one of those who mentioned that this is a process that we must also anchor in the hearts and minds of people. I do agree with that, but we should also recognise that this requires determined political leadership by each and every one of us. If you look back on the history of our Union, it is easy to note that very little in the history of European integration has happened because of some sudden groundswell of public opinion demanding it.  Nearly everything has been the result of visionary, farsighted, often difficult and demanding political leadership, but we have also subsequently won the support of our citizens for what we are doing.  I said that I was Prime Minister of my country when we entered the European Union. We fought a very bitter referendum campaign. We won that narrowly. We had public opinion against the European Union for quite some time. We are now, if you look at the public opinion polls, one of the more Europositive countries in Europe. It took political leadership to achieve that. It does not happen by itself.  Let me also say, when we go to the more difficult areas of Europe, that reconciliation is not easy. That requires a lot of that leadership, and reconciliation has yet to be fully achieved in all parts of Europe.  The western Balkans were taken up by a number of speakers, and rightly so. Let me assure you that we are aware of the issues of Kosovo, and of the need to move forward with them, taking some of the issues that we have inside our Union into account as well.  Bosnia has been taken up by several people, such as Mrs Pack and Mr Swoboda, and let me just make a couple of remarks there. I have spent four full days this year engaging with the political leadership of Bosnia, trying to move them forward and trying to tell them the dangers of slipping behind when the rest of the region is moving ahead. I have probably done too much because at the end of the day, as Mrs Pack said, they have to do this by themselves. It is their country, not our country, but we also have the duty to tell them that, if they do not do it, the rest of the region will move ahead and that will not be good for their country. That is what we have been trying to do, and to a certain extent are still trying to do.  Our process of enlargement, as everyone has been pointing out, is performancebased. It requires reforms. It requires reconciliation. And that applies to each and every one. It did apply to Sweden once upon a time, and we managed. It applies to each and every one.  As to the gentleman who was interested in engaging in debate, I did notice that there were a number of  mainly  gentlemen from the Far Right up there who had their reservations on Turkey, to put it in the mildest possible terms. If I understood the argument, it was that Turkey is too large, too complicated and too Muslim.  If you read Article  49  of the treaty, and that is what we have to base our policies on, it does not make any exceptions for big countries, it does not make any exceptions for complicated cases, and it has no religious criteria.  (Applause from the centre left)  So that is what we have to abide by. I listened to the moving words on the Christian heritage, and there is much truth in that. All the Catholics and Orthodox or Protestants and Anglicans might interpret that in very different ways, but I would caution against defining the Jewish heritage out of Europe. They are not Christians, but they are, with all of the problems in our history, also part of our Europe of the past, the present and the future.  I would also argue that it would equally be a mistake to define citizens of Muslim faith, be they inside our existing Member States, be they in Bosnia, be they somewhere else or be they in Turkey, and exclude them from the applicability of Article  49  of the treaty. I think that would be a mistake.  (Applause from the centre left)  I listened with interest in that respect to Mrs Koppa representing Greece in her comments on both the challenges in the western Balkans and reconciliation with Turkey, and I have noted the steps and statements made by Prime Minister Papandreou lately.  Could I just finally pick up one of my favourite items. Someone mentioned, as sometimes happens in this debate, the question of absorption capacity  that we simply cannot absorb too many countries. I do not like the word. I do not see our Union as absorbing nations. I do not know if we have absorbed Britain. And I do not know if France wants to be absorbed. And I hope Sweden will never be absorbed.  I see our Union as enriching the countries when we enter, and I have yet to see an enlargement that has made our Union weaker. Every single enlargement, although it has been difficult, has made our Union stronger, has made it richer, has made it more ambitious, and I for one do not belong to those who believe that history has come to an end. Article  49  applies.  Finally, one of the gentlemen said there are other countries as well that we have not debated on. That is true. Article  49  applies to each and every European country, including those that have not yet been mentioned in the debate today.
2932287 author: Sebastian Reid:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Madam President, I am grateful for this opportunity to briefly discuss Somalia and, in particular, the very serious problem that is caused by piracy off the coast of Somalia.  I will not go into all of the background: the country has been in dire straits for more than  18  years, the humanitarian situation is horrible, and there is strife throughout the country. There is a process with the transitional federal government, but it is fragile  to put it in the mildest possible terms  and it requires sustained efforts by the international community to gradually move the country towards reconciliation and gradually build up some sort of functioning state that can restore some kind of stability to this horribly torn country.  Piracy is a very serious threat indeed. Addressing that requires a broad engagement within the country itself which, as indicated, is enormously difficult given the current security situation in the country. Accordingly, as you have noticed, our current efforts have been concentrated on practical assistance that can be delivered outside Somalia for the benefit of the country and the people. We are, of course, discussing, as you might be aware, further steps in that particular respect.  On the specific problem of piracy, the Atalanta naval operation continues to operate successfully off the coast of Somalia. All shipments from the World Food Programme have been safely delivered to Somalia from Mombasa to Mogadishu and to Berbera. No successful attacks have occurred in the Gulf of Aden since early May  2009 . This is, at least to a certain extent, the outcome of the commitment of the EU Member States and the rest of the international community, which has helped to produce a highlevel generation of significant naval assets. The operations success in this limited respect is also the result of close cooperation between the civilian maritime community and the EU operational headquarters at Northwood in the UK. This has allowed the development of best management practices which are also increasingly respected by seafarers. There has also been very effective implementation of the coordinated mechanism for the naval protection of commercial traffic in the Gulf of Aden.  For the time being, therefore, it can be said that piracy in the Gulf of Aden has been contained, but still continues. For this reason, the Council has decided to extend the counterpiracy operation until December  2010 . This means that we have to be able to sustain our current efforts and maintain the right level of military resources. In parallel, we expect UN Security Resolution AL 1846  to be extended over the coming days.  In spite of what I have said, there is no room for complacency. Pirates continue to extend their activities further to the east into the Indian Ocean, and with the end of the monsoon season, we have recently witnessed a new surge of attacks to the north and northeast of the Seychelles, which is quite a distance away. No fewer than  11  ships are currently being held  all of them following attacks in what is referred to as the Somali Basin  with a total of  250  crew members.  With operation Atalanta, we have reinforced our capabilities in this remote maritime area. Additional patrol aircraft have been deployed in the Seychelles, and I can announce that Swedish maritime patrol aircraft will join the force in the Seychelles as well. This has proved helpful. For the time being, additional protection measures are already in place or planned on a national basis, with France, and more recently Spain, offering an appropriate and effective response.  There is also the protection of the internationally recognised transit corridor in the Gulf of Aden. That is the recommended route through the Gulf, and all ships benefit from naval protection irrespective of their flag. We currently have naval units there from the European Union, from NATO and from the USled coalition maritime forces with very good coordination of the patrols and with the very essential intelligence cooperation that is necessary for an operation of this sort.  China is now willing to associate itself with this coordination mechanism and to participate in the protection. This means that existing mechanisms will have to be evolved and widened. It could, in due course, lead to China, and possibly other maritime powers, taking some responsibilities. Others  Russia, India and Japan  have also deployed naval assets, and they should be invited to join this mechanism as soon as possible. Coordination is, of course, the key to success.  I know that there is some interest in Parliament in the rather difficult question of the trial of suspected pirates who have been arrested and apprehended by Atalanta units. There are currently  75  suspects being held in Kenyan jails. The legal process involved amounts to nine different trials and creates a significant additional burden on the Kenyan judicial system. The proper conduct of these trials is, of course, essential if we are to maintain both the deterrent effect provided by Atalanta and the overall credibility of our counterpiracy efforts. A recent agreement with Seychelles, which I imagine you are aware of, on the transfer of suspected pirates constitutes an important additional contribution in this respect. Piracy is a very lucrative business, and it is important that in every single respect, we gear our different activities towards reducing every possibility of the pirates gaining further money from these truly despicable operations that they carry out.  At the end of the day, of course, what we are doing in the maritime waters cannot be a substitute for what needs to be done in Somalia or on Somalia itself, but that, as I indicated earlier, is something where immediate success cannot be taken for granted. We will have to continue the maritime operation and this will require firstly that we are prepared to sustain a longterm commitment of military assets; secondly, that we will have to strengthen coordination cooperation between all of the powers and international bodies involved in this operation; and thirdly, that we must also help to develop regional maritime capabilities as the burden cannot only be on us. The maritime international organisations, such as the contact group on piracy, will have an important role to play here.  Finally, this is one of the areas where we have demonstrated the capabilities of the ESDP in recent years. Go back a couple of years and few of even the most ambitious here would have envisaged us operating European Union naval assets in the Gulf of Aden or in the Indian Ocean. Imperative humanitarian and other reasons have led us to what has, within the limits of what is possible, so far proved to be a relatively successful operation, but let us not have any illusions. Much remains to be done. We need to sustain the operation, and the support of the Parliament is very important in this respect.
10473806 author: Claire MacLeod:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, this time the focus on the whole question of Somalia is wider, also addressing the root causes of this scourge with sustainable methods. The Commission has always maintained that piracy can only be finally eradicated by addressing the underlying causes, beginning with the instability in Somalia and also addressing the countrys development needs, which manifest themselves in the most extreme poverty, including massive illiteracy and vulnerability.  Therefore, a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of security and development in Somalia, which have been mentioned, is essential. This will require the establishment of a functioning state, capable of enforcing laws and providing at least basic services. In the medium to long term, governance, including institutionbuilding and security, education and economic development are necessary preconditions for the eradication of the incentives which now exist for Somalis to become pirates.  On the security side, a rapid approach is essential. The African Union has, as you know, a pivotal role to play, not least through AMISOM, which is the African Union force providing security for the transitional federal government in Mogadishu. Through the Africa Peace Facility, the European Union is a major contributor to AMISOM, providing funds to support African Union forces. The new contribution agreement of EUR  60  million has just been finalised. This is part of a pledge made by the Commission at the conference in Brussels in April this year. The joint strategy paper  20082013  defines Commission assistance to Somalia and, in concrete terms, the EC support programme for Somalia has a budget of, altogether, EUR  215 . 4  million from the European Development Fund (EDF) for the period  20082013 .  The Operation ATALANTA, the EUs first naval operation, will soon celebrate its anniversary. This operation is a success, providing deterrence to piracy but also raising the awareness of the shipping community on best selfprotection measures. But, we all know that much more has yet to be done. In parallel to the operation ATALANTA, the Commission uses the instrument of stability, a financial instrument, to support the Kenyan justice system  as the President of the Council has just mentioned  because Kenya has undertaken to prosecute transferred suspected pirates apprehended by the operation, and it is necessary that there should not be impunity. This support to the Kenyan judiciary system includes a sort of mixture of capacitybuilding measures for prosecution, police, judicial and prison services. The programme is implemented through the UNODC at a cost of EUR  1 . 75  million.  In a broader context, regional maritime capacity development is also an important aspect of ensuring security in the area. The Commission supports the implementation of the socalled Djibouti Code of Conduct of the International Maritime Organisation, once again by using our instrument for stability. A programme dealing with certain critical maritime routes, including the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden region, will assist the creation of a regional training centre for maritime affairs in Djibouti. This centre will focus on the capacitybuilding and training of maritime administration staff, officials and coastguards of the region, including from Somalia, Puntland and Somaliland, as feasible. A regional informationsharing centre in Sanaa, Yemen, has also been identified for funding in  2009 . The first phase of this programme has already started and technical feasibility studies are launched.  Let me now turn to another important issue before concluding. The Commission is developing an integrated maritime policy  including an external dimension  and also integrated maritime surveillance across the sectors and borders to generate maritime situational awareness of activities at sea, impacting, among other things, on maritime safety and security, but also on general law enforcement.  The current Swedish Presidency has initiated a significant effort to ensure the interpillar coherence of EU maritime policy, ensuring the link between Community action and the work developed under the second pillar, notably by the European Defence Agency. We believe that the integration of maritime surveillance has a strong potential to assist EU operations against piracy, as the harvesting of maritime surveillance data from different sources allows authorities acting at sea to take decisions and react in a more informed manner.  All these different strands of activities, which are also outlined in the EP resolution of last October, constitute the Commissions contribution to the fight against piracy.
4076467 author: Sebastian Reid:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, the World Food Summit last week in Rome is the latest in a series of highlevel events organised this year where food security and agriculture have featured prominently: in January in Madrid, in July in LAquila, in September in New York and Pittsburgh, as well as at the meeting of the Committee on World Food Security last month.  The underlying premise of all these events has been the realisation that we are failing in the fight against world hunger. Over one billion people in the world presently do not meet their daily basic nutritional needs, and the situation is threatening to get worse in many developing countries, owing also to the effects of climate change, which is posing additional challenges to these countries capacity to become food secure.  The World Summit on Food Security represented an opportunity to sustain the political momentum that has been building up in past months. Once more, world food security has been in the spotlight. However, the time for discussion is over; now it is time to deliver.  For the European Commission, the summit was a useful event for three reasons. First, there was the pledge to renew our efforts to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by  2015 . In my view, that target is still valid, and we should strive to reach it  particularly in those countries and regions where progress towards its achievement has been very limited, for example, in Africa.  Second, the promise to improve international coordination and the governance of food security through a reformed Committee on World Food Security, which would become a central component of the global partnership for agriculture, food security and nutrition. The European Commission has actively encouraged this reform and is assisting in providing core funding for it. This is, in my view, a very important step, which will pave the way for a global governance system of food security based on sound scientific advice but one also more open to key actors in the public and private sector and nongovernmental organisations. These actors are crucial to making the new system more effective than the current one.  Third, the promise to reverse the downward trend in domestic and international funding for agriculture, food security and rural development. If we want to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by  2015 , the commitments taken to increase ODA must be fulfilled  in particular by those countries which have committed themselves to reaching the target of  0 . 7  of gross national income.  Some have criticised the final declaration for not setting more precise official development assistance targets for agriculture and food security, but we must recall that significant financial pledges had already been made at the G 8  Summit in LAquila. The priority now is to honour them. With strong support from the European Parliament, the Commission has successfully mobilised the EUR  1  billion food facility, of which  85  is already committed for the period  20092011 . However, we need more and sustained assistance over time. In order to be accountable for our pledges, we need a global pecking system of commitments, but we also have to develop monitoring mechanisms, specific indicators and benchmarks which can be used to report on the outcomes and impacts of investments. However  and let me say this loud and clear  even the most substantial commitment by donors will be worthless if governments in developing countries fail to translate their own commitments into better agricultural policies, strategies and investments.  In discussing food security, we should also be careful about terminology, and distinguish food security from food sovereignty and food selfsufficiency. Efforts to achieve production around the world are not enough in their own right. What counts is that people should have sustained access to food, which is basically a poverty question. Food trade  regional as well as global  plays an important part in enhancing access to food by providing farmers with an income and by allowing consumers access to cheaper food. Selfsufficiency in food or autarchy could be a very costly strategy and will not be necessary when markets and trade work well.  Therefore, concluding the Doha Round with a balanced and comprehensive outcome would be a major step ahead. We should also not forget that global food security is a very complex and multifaceted problem which requires a holistic approach. In this area, the European Union has made enormous progress in the past decade and progress will continue to be ensured through the Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) process. The various reforms of the EU common agricultural policy have strongly reduced export refunds and the vast majority of support for farmers in the EU is recognised as being nontrade distorting by the WTO. Moreover, with the Everything But Arms arrangement, market access to the EU is free for the least developed countries, and the provisions of the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) show an understanding of problems faced by many of the ACP countries in guaranteeing food security to their citizens. We have therefore come a very long way in the EU, in enhancing policy coherence for development and thereby creating improved food security conditions for developing countries. Other countries and regions should do the same.  To conclude, the FAO Summit has underscored that if we want to keep to our objective of halving hunger by  2015 , then we should step up ODA and increase ODA and private investments in agriculture and we should improve global governance of the agricultural sector.
1721681 author: Claire McNabb:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I also deplore that none of the G 8  leaders were present at Rome except for Commission President Barroso, and of course, it adds to the image that this has been a summit which did not bring that much new. When you look at the final declaration this is, I think, also obvious. On the other hand, I think it is also very important that we managed to keep the food security item on the political agenda and the result of the several summits we have been witnessing in  2009  has certainly been that it is now high on the international agenda and that, whenever world leaders meet, for example, latterly in Pittsburgh for the G 20 , there is talk of development cooperation and development policy. So that in itself is a very positive element.  I have been in Rome and I must say that apart from the final declaration which is, I must agree, a little bit disappointing, there have been very good discussions and also a very good presence, and something can come out of it. For example, there was a whole discussion on the selling of fertile land in developing countries and countries which have no arable land; buying them itself is a very interesting topic to discuss and I think it is also one where we can come to some common understanding.  The second thing I would like to say is that, as a couple of Members have already said, the CAP is, of course, not ideal. Nothing is ideal in this world, but when you look at the effect of the common agricultural policy on the developing world, I think we can claim that it is, by far, the least harmful system of a big trading block with respect to distorting effects in the developing countries. The WTO has acknowledged that most, if not all, of our subsidies are nontradedistorting because they are supporting agricultural income, not the prices of agricultural products.  I am also a little bit, how should I put it, disappointed that we are blaming ourselves all the time. Europe is not ideal either but I think that with the Food Facility, for example, we took a major step forward. This involves EUR  1  billion on a twoyear basis; it is not about supporting the delivery of food, but is largely focused on delivering seeds and so on, sustaining small agricultural producers in the developing world. I think this really is an innovation. It has also been acknowledged as such by the World Bank, for example, which is taking over this mechanism. So we should not blame ourselves all the time. By the way, this facility was an innovation by my predecessor. There is one thing I do not agree with him and that was about a gentleman who, in the meantime, has disappeared, Mr Le Hyaric. He is not a socialist, my predecessor, he is a communist; I mean you should look at his political group: he is a communist and that probably explains the reasoning he was using.  Having said this, also in LAquila, we took up our responsibility as a European Commission and we pledged USD  4  billion, which is about  20  of the food package and the support package that was agreed in LAquila. With that, we are by far the largest donor that made pledges in LAquila and we are also going to honour them. We are also going to commit this sum and to disburse this as soon as possible.  I will end by saying a last word on the new EU agricultural and food security policy because, in the  2010  work programme of the Commission, there is a plan to present to the Council and the Parliament a communication on a renewed policy for agriculture and food security for the European Union. This document will review current issues affecting agriculture and food security, for example, challenges posed by climate change, enhanced attention to nutrition and food quality, safety nets and social protection policies, the impact of biofuels on food production or the use and impact of new technologies and biotechnologies, increased calls for rightsbased approaches, largescale land acquisition, etc.  The communication will aim firstly at renewing the EU commitment to assist developing countries advancing their agricultural production. This remains crucial, notably in view of the increasing demand for food due to a growing global population and changing dietary patterns and the challenges and threats that climate change is posing to sustainable agricultural production. Secondly, it will aim at launching reflection on how the EU could best use its experience and knowhow to support the emergence of regional policies and strategic frameworks in agriculture and food security. Thirdly, it will aim at providing the basis for the whole EU approach to harmonise existing ECMS policy frameworks following the commitments set out in the LAquila agenda for action. Fourthly, it will aim at proposing ways on how the EU could contribute to accelerating the process towards the achievements of the MDGs and notably, MDG 1  in view of the upcoming review of the MDGs in September  2010  in New York. Fifthly, it will aim at better positioning the EU visvis current developments in the global food agricultural governance system, and lastly, at addressing issues that have recently gained prominence in the food security agenda.  A public consultation on an issues paper was launched on  16  November and will close in early January. Thus we will consult all the stakeholders and then come forward with a formal communication by the European Commission.
1080764 author: Helen Merx:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Courts annual report for  2008 . I have already had the opportunity to thank the Court for the very good cooperation enjoyed again this year. We have had a very fruitful dialogue and the report is very constructive.  As you have just heard President Caldeira state, the level of irregularity has decreased overall in recent years. Things really started to improve five years ago, and, since  2004 , the red area, where the Court finds the most errors and for which it gives a red card, has been reduced by half.  For  2008 , the report shows a completely clean opinion on the accounts for the second year in a row, as a result of the major achievement of the thorough reform and transition to accrual accounting.  Secondly, for the first time, agriculture, taken as a whole, has now become clean and green. This can certainly be attributed to the substantial simplification efforts of recent years. Thirdly, the policy group entitled education and citizenship has also become green.  For research in general, things are improving and the Court points out that irregularities are essentially linked to the Sixth Framework Programme, which allows hope that the improved and simplified Seventh Framework Programme rules will bring a better result.  Again, as last year, the Court has found no red light for the management and control systems. Moreover, all annual activity reports by Commission services are deemed by the Court to give reasonable assurance, with or without qualifications, that internal control systems ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. This said, the report also clearly charts the work that still needs to be done.  The red area is now about  30 , corresponding to cohesion spending, which is the one area where the Court has still not found significant progress in the level of irregularities. This was perhaps to be expected, given that in  2008 , the Court did not audit payments made under the improved systems set up for the new  20072013  programming period. In this regard, the Commission notes that the Courts findings on cohesion largely coincide with our own general assessment.  For the structural funds, the Commission had reservations in  2008  because of deficiencies in the control systems for Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, France, Poland and Luxembourg. The Commission is not shy regarding transparency as to where the systemic problems lie. The names of these Member States were published back in June in the Commissions synthesis report.  The Court also reminds us of the essential role of complete and reliable information from all Member States on financial corrections. We need this to prove that multiannual control systems work and to mitigate the effects of the errors detected.  The Court further recommends that the Commission should continue to strive to gain assurance from the annual summaries of all Member States, as well as from voluntary initiatives by certain Member States, in the form of national declarations, or by supreme audit institutions.  The Commission agrees that we obviously need to be able to count on quality inputs from Member States. We see improvements, but we are also considering strengthening the legal base to accelerate the process.  Finally, the Court emphasises the importance of clear objectives, transparent and easytounderstand rules, and effective supervision. This reduces the risk of error and the costs of control. However, it is not something that can be achieved from one day to the next and, of course, the upcoming reviews of the budget, the financial framework and the financial regulation present opportunities not to be missed.  What we need to do now is to improve assurances obtained from Member States for structural funds, striving for more simplification, which increasingly will require changes to the legislation governing the various programmes. The revision of the Financial Regulation is currently under consultation, and the Commission will make proposals in spring  2010 . We also need to define together an acceptable ratio between costs and risk  the socalled tolerable risk of error.  The European Parliament has, in the past, strongly supported the Commissions efforts to achieve a positive statement of assurance. Now that our efforts are becoming measurable, I hope I can count on its continuing backing to move forward.  The  2008  discharge procedure starts in the last days of this Commission and is expected to conclude in the early months of the next Commission. Even though it concerns last years budget, let us make it a forwardlooking procedure.
6018640 author: Marc Corless:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak to Parliament before it finalises its second reading with Thursdays vote on the  2010  budget and on amending budget No  102009 , which has, in part, contributed to the successful outcome of the annual budgetary procedure.  The negotiations on the  2010  budget have required compromises and  may I dare to say  even sacrifices on all sides to achieve our common goal. This would not have been possible without the constructive and responsible role played by the European Parliament and the Council throughout the negotiations.  I would like to highlight four main points.  Firstly, let me point out some key elements of the conciliation outcome. Since the joint declaration agreed last April, we knew that we had to strike a delicate balance to find a source of financing for the EUR  2 . 4  billion of the European Economic Recovery Plan still outstanding. That could only be achieved through a compensation mechanism and by using all budgetary means existing in the multiannual financial framework. This was indeed a difficult constraint.  Despite such a difficult constraint, we succeeded in financing completely the Recovery Plan in  2010  and, as the general rapporteur points out, in agreeing on an EU budget that can be a tool to help overcome the economic crisis.  In times of difficulties, I believe the message to citizens is even stronger as we have also been able to respond at the same time to the unforeseen specific needs of milk producers, with the substantial support of Parliament.  Last but not least, the two arms of the Budgetary Authority have acknowledged the need for further assistance in  2010  to Bulgarias efforts relating to the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, through the use of the flexibility instrument.  Secondly, as regards the reserves, let me thank Parliament and particularly the general rapporteur, Mr Surjn, for taking into account the responses given by the Commission in reaction to Parliaments first reading, in the socalled letter of executability.  That has led to an important reduction in the reserves entered in the  2010  draft budget at the time of Parliaments first reading.  Thirdly, I wish to stress the importance of a smooth transition to the Lisbon Treaty. We are now definitively rooted in the Lisbon Treaty as regards the budgetary procedure. Despite the uncertainties relating to the entry into force of the new treaty, we have been able to secure a smooth transition into the new legal framework.  The period ahead of us will be a challenge for all the institutions, as it will imply a modification of their approach and behaviour, with the need for reinforced dialogue from the very start of the budgetary procedure. The Commission is ready to play its part and to reconcile positions in the new conciliation committee, while respecting the rights of the two arms of the Budgetary Authority, on an equal footing.  Today, we know that efforts are still to be made to put in place all the new legal instruments stemming from the entry into force of the treaty. Nonetheless, by building on the loyal interinstitutional collaboration developed over the last two decades, we have been able to agree on a set of transitional measures that will allow the  2010  budget to work effectively.  Finally, there is amending budget No  102009 , revision of the financial framework and mobilisation of the flexibility instrument. I take note that Parliament has also agreed to adopt the proposals on the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework and, as already mentioned, on the flexibility instrument and amending budget No  10 .  I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bge, for endorsing the results of the conciliation. This shows that, to achieve our goal, we have been able to make the best use of the tools provided by the current interinstitutional agreement.  I would like also to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the  2009  budget, Mrs Haug, for her work throughout the year on the implementation of the  2009  budget and her support for amending budget No  102009 , which is part of the package linked with the revision of the Multiannual Financial framework and the financing of the Recovery Plan.  I have also noted your critical remarks towards the Commission about the need to improve its performance in terms of budget implementation.  This years amending budget foresees a reduction of EUR  3 . 2  billion in payment appropriations, which is significantly lower than the EUR  4 . 9  billion reduction of last year, and points to an improvement in the execution of a budget which, after the proposed reduction, is set at EUR  113  billion for  2009 .  However, there is still room for further improvement, and I can assure you that the Commission will continue to do its utmost to make best use of the authorised budget appropriations in  2010 .  As to the issue of the simplification of procedures in order to accelerate the implementation of expenses, while this avenue can be explored, I believe a careful balance needs to be struck between real simplification and the need to abide by the rules in order to safeguard the EUs financial interests.  Once again, I would like to express my thanks to Parliaments negotiating team and, in particular, to the Chair of the Budget Committee, Mr Lamassoure, and to the rapporteurs for the  2010  budget, Mr Surjn and Mr Maka.  I would also like to thank the Councils negotiating team and, in particular, the State Secretary, Mr Lindblad, for the constructive work done during the budgetary process.  I hope that todays debate will be constructive and productive and will lead to a positive vote on the  2010  budget this Thursday.
8062177 author: Victor Merx:  VicePresident designate of the Commission.  Mr President, the Council adopted very substantive conclusions on the Middle East peace process last week. These set out a principled position on a number of crucial issues in a clear and determined manner. I will not dwell on the conclusions or repeat what the Presidency has said. Suffice to say that in reaffirming our principles, I hope we may have helped restore some Palestinian confidence and willingness to enter into the peace process. The conclusions, of course, will also be of great help to me, in providing me with a clear steer for the months to come.  You have invited me here today to talk about our political work, but also about the situation in East Jerusalem. This is an area of deep concern. East Jerusalem is occupied territory, together with the rest of the West Bank. The EU is opposed to the demolition of Palestinian homes, the eviction of Palestinian families, the construction of Israeli settlements and the route of the separation barrier. The EU is addressing these issues at political level, through diplomatic channels and in our public statements. We are also addressing the situation through practical assistance, aimed at supporting the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem. For example, there is a lack of  1   200  classrooms for Palestinian children in the city, so we are helping to reinforce education facilities. In addition, we enable Palestinian hospitals in East Jerusalem to remain viable and we do a lot of work with Palestinian young people in the city who suffer from high rates of unemployment and psychological problems. To date, in East Jerusalem, the EU is implementing activities costing EUR  4 . 6  million.  Another aspect of concern, of course, is the situation in Gaza. We have consistently called for the flow of aid, trade and persons. We are deeply concerned about the daily living conditions of the Gazan people: since the January conflict, donors have not been able to do reconstruction work and serious issues persist like the lack of clean drinking water. Israel should reopen the crossings without delay, which would allow a revival of the private sector and a reduction of Gazas aid dependency.  It is now time to move to action and put the Council conclusions into practice. We now need to think about how we can reengage a political process. The two sides appear to have strayed further apart, in terms of engaging on an end game. I will be travelling to the region shortly and my main objective will be to meet the main actors and see first hand how the EU can be a force for change. I believe we all agree with the overall and overriding priority of a resumption of IsraeliPalestinian negotiations  not negotiations for negotiations sake, but negotiations to achieve a peace deal and turn the page. We cannot  nor, I doubt, can the region  tolerate another round of fruitless negotiations. Negotiations have taken place on and off for several years starting with the Oslo Declaration of Principles signed in September  1993 . That was  16  years ago. Negotiations should be based on international law and respect previous agreements. All issues should be on the table including the status of Jerusalem as the future shared capital.  They should also take place within an agreed timeframe with effective mediation. We need to see a serious commitment and the political will from both Israel and Palestine to engage in serious and genuine negotiations. The European Union is there to help both parties take that engagement and offer them support on the difficult road of negotiations. I am here to make sure Europe works effectively and harmoniously.  The EU has consistently supported both Israel and the Palestinians by giving them the time and space to negotiate bilaterally. Our assistance has enabled the Palestinian Authority to build the institutions of the future state of Palestine, so that it can deliver services to its people and be a reliable neighbour in the region. Today, however, the Palestinians are divided both politically and physically. Credible negotiations require a strong and united Palestinian partner. Israel stands to gain, not lose, from a strong Palestinian partner.  Israel has taken a first step with its temporary and partial settlement freeze. We hope this will contribute towards a resumption of meaningful negotiations.  The US remains an indispensable and crucial actor in the Middle East. Conditions for an effective EUUS partnership on the Middle East have rarely been as good. It is time to turn this into a reality by closely coordinating our positions and strategy. The EU will continue to support and work closely with the US via the Quartet. The Quartet needs reinvigoration  the current stalemate in the peace process demands it. The Quartet can provide the careful, yet dynamic, mediation that is required.  Peace in the Middle East requires a comprehensive solution. Both Syria and Lebanon have an important role to play. We look forward to the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative. They should be part of the solution. Our approach should be regional and inclusive. A multilateral framework should complement the IsraeliPalestinian bilateral framework.  In the coming months, I intend to remain in close contact with Parliament on all these issues. I am aware of the active role Parliament plays, not least in its capacity as budgetary authority. At political level, the EP delegations work directly with the Israeli Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC). Last week, the Delegation to the PLC visited the occupied Palestinian territories and reported with great concern on the situation on the ground.  Finally, I welcome the continuation of Parliaments working group on the peace process, which will meet again this week.
5237588 author: Philip White:  VicePresident designate of the Commission.  Mr President, can I just say that the issue of where I sit, I suspect, will keep coming back. I am sitting here because the Council is over there. I may have to go and sit over there or you may have to build me a seat equidistant, because I assure you I will be in trouble somewhere for wherever I sit. It is a great delight, though, to be here with Cecilia and I look forward very much to working with her.  What strikes me about the debate that we have just had is that pretty much  and I think, Mr Atkins, you may be the exception in what you said, though I listened with great care  there is a shared conviction that what we are looking for is a twostate solution. There is an enormous amount of passion from all parliamentarians, especially, if I may say, Mr De Rossa and those Members who have recently come back, and who have clearly seen for themselves the dreadful situation that exists on the ground.  I believe what is significant about the Council conclusions is that they are very clear. They give me a real sense of the direction that we need to move in. What is also very clear  and I pay tribute to the Presidency for the work that they have done on this  is the frustration in this House that things are not moving, frustration borne of views that are sometimes quite different, but nonetheless converge on a desire to see a solution. The nuances are important. The views that you hold on the differences, as well as the similarities, matter to me as I navigate our future in these discussions and negotiations.  There is no doubt to me that we have got to do two things. One is the rather political issues that you quite rightly raise. What is our relationship to be? I am at the beginning of that journey, and this debate is extremely important to me in listening to the views that have been put forward. What I take away from it is, first of all, that the Quartet must demonstrate that it is worth the money, that it is actually able to be reinvigorated. I have already talked with the staff by video link in Jerusalem, I have already talked to Mr Blair about his work and I have already talked to Secretary of State Clinton about the same things. It is very important, if it is going to work, that the word reinvigorate is absolutely right.  Secondly, there are the issues in the region which the Presidency has raised about the broader questions of those other countries that we need to engage with. I think most significant from today is: what is the EU itself going to be able to do?  That brings me, in a sense, to what I call the practical. A number of colleagues have raised particular issues, whether it is a question of what the UK is doing on labelling, whether it is issues about the association agreement, whether this report  the Heads of Mission report  and the recommendations that I have not yet considered within it are there. We need to consider all of these issues carefully, but what we have got to do is demonstrate the practical support that we put on the ground.  I described  1   200  classrooms that were needed and I described our work in health. We are very committed to Prime Minister Fayyads statebuilding plan and to enhancing the institutions, particularly in terms of the rule of law. We must be seen to be practically engaged on the ground and practically working to find ways in which we can make the situation better for the people who have to live there every day and who look to us for the help that they need.  That is the most significant and practical thing I need to do first of all. I would describe the work that I want to do as this: we have the potential to do the political and the economic. What I want to do is draw those two things together, to find a way in which we can enhance what we do, to support the work that is going on, to make the Quartet more effective, to bring together what has been, in a sense, the Council and Commission operating side by side, and to meld it into one so that what we do on the ground really makes a difference.  In the end, it is the two sides who come together to make the decision and to find the peace. But, on the way to the end, we have a significant role to play, and I am determined, on your behalf as well as on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we play our full part in that.
2345624 author: Amy Cameron:  author.  Mr President, can I start by saying that it is very good to see Commissioner Wallstrm in the room, as well as Cecilia Malmstrm, from the PresidencyinOffice, because we were both engaged in this dossier from the outset, in  1999 .  It is interesting to reflect that what we achieved in our agreement in May  2001  was somehow historic, amongst  15  Member States moving from different traditions and cultures, and different approaches, to openness and transparency. We managed to reach an agreement and, interestingly, in no small way was that due to the determination of the Swedish Presidency at the time.  It was also due to the determination of the Commission to recognise that all three institutions needed a cultural change. We needed to see that openness and transparency did not prevent democracy from flourishing, but actually improved it. It allowed accountability. It allowed citizens to see what was being done in their name and, arguably, it helped us to lift the curtain and to prove once and for all that there were no terrible secrets hidden in the safes of the Commission or the Council  I am not so sure about Parliament, but hopefully not in Parliaments safes either!  I want to thank in particular the Commissioner and, if I may, my dear former colleague, Cecilia Malmstrm, for that commitment. Now we need another commitment. As I said, we have achieved a huge amount. We have a register of documents. We have the jurisprudence of the ECJ, now defining and redefining what was originally agreed on access to documents. We have accepted the principle that all documents should remain accessible and that, where not accessible, access should be reasoned against quite clearly and specifically in reference to either Article  4   the exemptions  or Article  9   sensitive documents.  However, as we have moved on, Parliament has called repeatedly for a revision. I believe that the revision the Commission placed before Parliament, on which we subsequently voted in committee and the first reading of which was deferred in March of this year, did not go far enough, and I know we have a difference of opinion on this. Equally there were concerns  and those concerns still remain in this House  that there was an attempt to claw back on access to documents, not least in the redefining of documents  the notion that whole files could be exempted  and attempting to redefine the notion of the thirdparty veto.  It is interesting that our citizens sitting in the gallery must be thinking that we are talking about something that happens in outer space  articles, thirdparty vetoes  but actually what we are talking about is a law that allows them to make sure that we are accountable: parliamentarians accountable for what we do in their name, the Commission for what it does in their name, and, equally, the Council. How can they do that and the NGOs do that if the way we work and who does what within all of the different units remains a wellkept secret, open only to those lobbyists and those lawyers who know?  That is what I believe is at the heart of the Treaty of Lisbon. It says that we need to further enhance democracy. We need to enhance access to documents. That is why Parliament, in this oral question, is calling for a whole range of recommendations to be undertaken. Basically, it is about ensuring that the rights that we have are built upon, that they are not diminished, and about recognising that under Lisbon, it is no longer just the three institutions but all of the agencies and the bodies set up by them, including the European Central Bank, in some instances, the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, Europol and Eurojust. All of these institutions are now accountable under Regulation (EC) No  10492001 .  We believe that the proposals that have been brought forward since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty do not match either the spirit or the letter of that treaty or, indeed, the obligations that we believe are contained within the original Regulation (EC) No  10492001 , which, for the benefit of our listeners, governs public access to all the documents held, received or produced by the three institutions.
7998959 author: Helen Bush:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, honourable Members, if I may first turn to Mr Cashman. I think this is the last possibility or opportunity that I will have to say thank you to you. You are indeed the face of the fight for this particular regulation and for openness and transparency in Parliament. You have become the face, the symbol and the advocate of it.  I also think that we have a great deal of credibility, being Swedish, both Cecilia Malmstrm and myself, and I do not think that people will doubt that we will continue to fight for openness and transparency. At the same time, we have had our rows because we also play different roles and sometimes we have to be very realistic about what we can achieve and we have to fight our corners in each institution. That is not always easy. I think the whole political climate has also changed and the political balance has changed and that has affected our discussions on these issues.  But our starting point, I would say, is absolutely the same and we also state that this particular regulation on access to documents has served us very well. Over the years, this has been an excellent tool that we also want to be used by more than the lobbyists and those who are paid for looking at all the documents. We want the general public and journalists to be able to use it and have full access to documents. That is my starting point. I know that I share this view, as you could hear, with the Minister.  I think also the Swedish Presidency was a golden opportunity to move this issue forward. Now I really want to thank Parliament for the opportunity to have this debate on transparency and the new Lisbon Treaty because it places more emphasis on openness and what is called participatory democracy. We all agree that this is a most welcome development.  The concrete question on the table today is: What measures will the Commission take with regard to the revision of Regulation (EC) No  10492001 ?  As you know, with the Lisbon Treaty, the public right of access to documents has been extended, as we heard the minister saying, to documents of all institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, although there are some restrictions for the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank for natural reasons.  Concerning the review of Regulation (EC) No  10492001 , I want to point out that the new legal base, Article  15 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is very similar to the former Article  255  and the main difference is the extension of the institutional scope.  This issue was addressed by the Commission in our Communication on  2  December this year. This was aimed at aligning pending proposals for secondary legislation to the new treaty. (Some of you here may know it under the EU jargon as the omnibus act  lets forget that the minute I have said it!)  It means that either of the legislators can now introduce an amendment extending the scope of the Regulation to the other bodies and institutions. This is also to let the Council know that this has been presented by the Commission and adopted by the Commission.  Further progress in the legislative process leading to the adoption of an amended Regulation (EC) No  10492001  is in the hands of the legislators: Parliament and Council. We are still in the stage of the first reading. We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new Parliament. Of course, the Commission will go on to contribute to reaching an agreement  as in other legislative processes.  The Lisbon Treaty lays down a legal framework for participatory democracy. From the Commissions side, we have already taken a number of initiatives aimed at improving public consultation and participation on proposed new policies. For example, we will assess the Commissions consultation guidelines against the new provisions of the treaty and decide whether adjustments are necessary to further improve them, and we have already started the work on the citizens initiative by launching a public consultation, to listen to the citizens and the stakeholders before presenting a proposal.  The great importance of the citizens initiative was also recognised by the European Council last week. And the incoming Spanish Presidency, I have understood, has put this very high on the agenda. They want rapid delivery.  This morning, as we have already heard, the Interinstitutional Committee on Public Access to Documents met at the invitation of the Swedish Presidency. The task of this group is to examine best practice, address possible conflicts and discuss further developments on public access to documents.  So we decided together that we will have an Openness web portal; we will have complementarity of our institutions public registers; we will have our respective IT services sit down and coordinate their access efforts and we will now consider the impact on access to documents when our institutions create or change electronic storage systems.  I know that this is the time of year when you write wish lists. But I think when it comes to openness and transparency, you should not rely on Santa Claus. I think it is really up to us to deliver now: Parliament, Council and Commission. Real concrete and direct delivery. I think we have already started and we have to continue on this track so I am looking forward to our debate.
5176271 author: Annette Bauer:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, first of all, thank you for the frank discussion that we have had today.  I thought that many of you knew what we have been doing for Georgia. Georgia has received a lot of support from us, both political and also economic and humanitarian, but it seems as if we have not done anything. This is not true at all.  First of all, the war was stopped by the European Union and by Mr Sarkozy. Second, you are right, there is a sixpoint plan which, unfortunately, has not yet been fully implemented, but every time we work with the Russians, this is on our agenda. This is absolutely clear.  It is right, as the Council President said, that the only platform where we really start to go on, even slowly, is in Geneva, and so the Geneva talks have to go on.  We also need support and openness from both sides, because it is a difficult conflict and we are, so to speak, the mediators in this conflict. This is the number one political issue.  We do have to continue and we know very well that Russia is a huge partner on the other side. At the same time, we have a common neighbourhood, and therefore we always speak quite clearly about these issues with Russia. We do need, as I said here, the attitude on both sides to go forward, which is what I said in my speech if you will recall. This is the first point.  The second concerns the economic and humanitarian front, where we are working very closely indeed. The EUR  500  million package was the biggest package I could bring through. There is not so much money in the neighbourhood policy that I could have gone for, but this is what we did because we thought Georgia needed that after the war and all the damage that had been done  particularly for the most vulnerable.  I myself have visited the IDP camps and I have visited the houses that have been restored with our programmes.  I can tell Mrs Lunacek that I myself signed an agreement with the Georgians where they absolutely commit themselves to not using one cent of the European Union money. We always control our money, so normally there should not be a cent of our money going to rearming on the Georgian side.  I cannot, of course, control what Georgia is doing on other issues, but on our money I can be clear.  There are other things that have been mentioned. For instance, the two teenagers that are still in detention in South Ossetia. These are issues that we do of course mention to the Russians. We talk about them, but for the moment, unfortunately, we have no solution to it and we ourselves cannot enter South Ossetia.  As regards the principle, of course we are clear on the principle. There is territorial integrity and there is sovereignty, and this is what we clearly say of Georgia. Absolutely. It is, however, one thing to speak about principles and another thing to implement these principles immediately. This, unfortunately, is sometimes quite difficult.  Let me also speak about the Tagliavini report. The very fact that this report has been publicised is a very important one. You know we supported this independent report. I have known Mrs Tagliavini for ages from when I was OSCE chairpersoninoffice in the year  2000  as foreign minister of my country. She was then my special representative for the Caucasus. She is a very courageous, independent lady, and I must say she has made an excellent report.  This also helps because the report has made the facts clear. We draw the lessons from that, but we can only continue helping Georgia by diplomatic means.  Having said all of that, I can also say that we have been doing an enormous amount of work first on the neighbourhood policy to the east, and now on the Eastern Partnership.  The other day, we had a very important ministerial meeting under the Swedish Presidency with the six foreign ministers of the Eastern Partnership including the foreign minister from Georgia.  There, we also discussed all the possibilities, but would you really think that we can give everything to every country without them doing their part? We cannot. We have to ask them also to do their part. That also means on trade, as a free and deep trade agreement can only be there when the right legislation is there. We cannot just ask them to come into the European Union if the Council is not unanimous on it.  These are things where one has to see one side and the other, but we are supporting Georgia more than anybody else. So I would rather hope that this policy, as some have said, is really supported by you. This is a policy where we try to help them as much as we can, but we also want to see the right behaviour from Georgia.
378631 author: Marc Merx:  PresidentinOffice of the Council.  Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to address the European Parliament once again and at such a crucial time.  As we speak, representatives from  193  countries are gathered in a conference centre in Copenhagen, talking, arguing, negotiating and trying to meet the expectations of millions of people around the world. In just two days, the UN climate conference will be over. Soon we will be looking back at a meeting that was crucial, not only for the EU but for the world; a meeting that was decisive for those who cannot grow their crops because of a lack of water, decisive for those who have lost their homes in tornadoes or floods, and decisive for those who are vainly building walls against a sea level that rises every year.  We know what is at risk, so why is it then so difficult to act? Is it because we fear any change of our way of life? Still, we know that if we keep on using the worlds resources the way we do, our current way of life will no longer be an option and we will face even more drastic changes. We have much greater things than our everyday comfort to fear.  The fight against climate change has been at the top of the agenda throughout the Swedish Presidency, at all our European Council meetings and in all our summits with the Unions major partners. As you probably know, we adopted a comprehensive mandate at our October European Council to keep the EUs leading position in the climate negotiations. We agreed on a longterm goal for emissions reductions of  8095  by  2050  and we renewed our offer to reduce emissions   30 , provided that others make comparable efforts. We agreed on emission reductions for international transport and, despite resistance from some corners, we put figures on the global financial need in developing countries to fight climate change. Last week  after weeks of bilateral consultations  we took yet another step: a collectively puttogether financial package earmarked for the fast start of climate action in developing countries, offering EUR  7 . 2  billion for the coming three years.  I know that this is not enough. Therefore I must say that, while I am satisfied that the European Council could agree to this step, the time is now ripe for other developed countries to join us.  So, what do we need to do in Copenhagen? We need binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, not just from the developed countries, but also from developing countries, to ensure that global warming keeps below the  2  C target that science tells us is necessary.  I have sat down with the Indian and Chinese leadership. I know what they say about this. Why should they agree to develop clean and green, when we have polluted the world for decades? That is one way of looking at it, but the problem is this: the developed world cannot solve the problem alone. Emissions from the developing world are already starting to exceed those from the developed world. That is why we must work together to solve the problem. From our side, we can compensate for years of irresponsible behaviour. We can help finance climate action in the developing world. The European Union took its responsibility last week. It is not the form that matters in Copenhagen but the substance. We can be satisfied if we get a deal on emissions reductions and on financing, and a commitment to start immediate action and, more importantly, we can start fighting climate change.  Last year, we were suddenly faced with the most serious financial crisis since the  1930 s. The ground was literally shaking under our feet. Suddenly it became clear to us how interlinked the financial markets were and how interdependent we all were in finding a common response. In the course of only a few months, governments in the EU adopted extraordinary support measures. It was a fast and impressive response but it came with a price. Our aggregated deficit in public finances now amounts to almost  7  of GDP  over three times more than last year. Twenty Member States are experiencing excessive deficit procedures. So the followup to the economic and financial crisis has, quite naturally, been another main priority throughout this autumn.  Let me briefly touch on what we have done. At the end of October, we agreed on a fiscal exit strategy, and at last weeks European Council, we agreed on principles for exiting from financial support schemes. In addition, we agreed on a fundamentally new structure for financial supervision in Europe. When financial flows are international, supervision can no longer be national. Now it is up to the European Parliament to agree to the final steps.  It was also clear to us that the bonus culture could not continue in the way in which people had become used to. I am pleased that the EU managed to convince the G 20  to agree on farreaching changes to this policy. The new rules will reinforce the need for a link between result and reward.  The economic and financial crisis hit us hard but we have shown the ability to act and we have strengthened our resistance. Once we have secured our recovery, the EU will stand stronger, thanks to the measures we have adopted.  The Swedish Presidency took place during a period of institutional change. When we took over on  1  July, this Parliament was newly elected. We had not yet appointed a President of the European Commission. The outcome of the then pending Irish referendum was uncertain. It was not clear whether the Treaty of Lisbon would be ratified by all Member States. It was not even clear whether it could enter into force during the Swedish Presidency.  Then the drama unravelled. In close consultation with this Parliament, Jos Manuel Barroso was appointed President of the European Commission for a second term. The Presidency now had a stable counterpart in the Commission to work with. The outcome of the Irish referendum was a victory for Ireland. It was a victory for European cooperation. It brought us one step closer to the Treaty of Lisbon.  But then the unexpected happened. At a late stage, the Czech President came with new conditions before he would sign. We had to handle these requests in a way that did not trigger similar conditions from other Member States and we managed to do this at the European Council in October. A few days later, the Czech President signed. Immediately after the signature, I started to consult my colleagues again. We had to agree on highranking positions  on the President of the European Council, and to nominate the High Representative. I am not exaggerating when I say it was a relief when all preparations were finalised on  1  December. The Treaty of Lisbon could finally enter into force.  Now, the European Union will be more efficient. It will have better tools to fight climate change and influence the global economic agenda. The new President of the European Council will ensure continuity. The High Representative will assure coordination in our external relations. We will have a more democratic Union with the greater involvement of the European Parliament and of our national parliaments. A new era for the European Union has begun.  When I stood here before you on  15  July, we were still in the throes of the financial and economic crisis. There was uncertainty on the transition of the new treaty. We did not know whether we would manage to unite ourselves and encourage others on the not so long  but very winding  road to Copenhagen.  With the European Council meeting last week, the Swedish Presidency has delivered on all five of its priorities: a strong EU mandate for climate change; followup of the economic and financial crisis; the EU Baltic Sea Strategy; the Stockholm Programme for justice and home affairs; reinforcing the EU as a global actor, including enlargement, and a new external action service. As I said, with the Treaty of Lisbon in place, a new era has begun in the European Union.  I would like to end by thanking all of you. The Presidency needed the help of the European Parliament in tackling the challenges we were facing. Thank you for giving us that help.  I would also like to thank the Commission, and especially Jos Manuel Barroso. I have probably spent more than a healthy amount of time with Jos Manuel this autumn. He has been a tremendous support to me and to the Swedish Presidency.  Finally, I would like to thank the Member States for their will to put aside differences and start compromising  with the best for Europe at heart  to find solutions that are not only of benefit to them, but to Europe as a whole. This unity is our strength.
2567879 author: Victor Green:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, Prime Minister, during the past six months, we have seen a new treaty come into force, ending almost a decade of debate and opening the door to new opportunities for this new, enlarged European Union we have today. We have seen the first evidence that decisive action taken to stabilise the European economy in the face of crisis is bearing some results. And as we enter the end game in Copenhagen, we can be clear that the European Union has been working hard to maintain the momentum it has championed towards decisive global action on climate change.  I would therefore like to pay a very sincere tribute to Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and all the team of the Swedish Presidency for a highly successful presidency. It is particularly important that the Swedish Presidency has been so effective in ensuring the completion of the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty, managing the transition to this new treaty while achieving all the other objectives. We have seen the appointment of the first President of the European Council and of the first High Representative, the VicePresident of the Commission, by the European Council. And let us not forget  because it was a very important moment for this Parliament, following the unanimous designation by the European Council  we have seen the election by this Parliament of the President of the next Commission with a qualified majority.  Last weeks European Council was the first time that it has met as a fully fledged institution. It was also the first time that the new High Representative and VicePresident of the Commission, Catherine Ashton, has attended. The new President of the European Council will be fully functioning by  1  January  2010  and has presented his ideas on how to organise the European Council in the future. I very much welcome all the proposals to give the European Council more consistency and more continuity in its work. I also welcome the ideas of having more political, frank discussions and short and punchy conclusions.  There were many other issues that were the object of the European Council. I would like to highlight just some, not forgetting one very important one, the definition of the Baltic Strategy, which can be a model for other regional cooperation inside the European Union and with some of our partners.  On the economy, we are keeping the right balance between maintaining the stimulus and preparing our exit strategies. I presented the scene for our European  2020  Strategy. I hope the European Council will focus on the discussion of this very important agenda for the future of Europe, namely through discussions in the next meetings, in the formal European Council in February and in the spring European Council. I would like to reiterate here my offer to come to this plenary so that Parliament can organise a specific debate on this very important issue. I think it is extremely important that there is full ownership by the European Parliament and, on the side of the Council, by the European Council, of this European Union  2020  Strategy, which is where our future will be played.  On the Stockholm Programme, the Commissions proposals have now been translated into an agreed approach for the next five years. I know that many in this Parliament share our determination to use this springboard to seize the opportunities of the Lisbon Treaty for a step change in European action on freedom, security and justice. That was one of the major reasons why I decided to reorganise the portfolios of the next College in this area. It is going to be one of the most important areas of the European Unions work in the next five years.  The European Council had a particular significance for climate change. In the past few years, the European Union has developed a consistent and ambitious approach on climate change. I am very proud that the Commission has been the initiator of this very ambitious agenda. The impact of reduced emissions may only be felt in several decades time, but we are already taking concrete steps, giving our targets the force of law.  Let us be frank about this. Some of our partners are announcing their intentions by press statements; but we have announced our intentions by law, law that is already agreed by all the Member States. The developed world must act, but it must also help the developing world to decouple growth and emissions. I think that it is right that the European Council last week centred on how we can put this global leadership at the service of an ambitious deal at Copenhagen: by promising help to developing countries not in some distant future but already next year; by making clear that the deal must be comprehensive and must have the verification mechanisms to make it stick; by maintaining our readiness to up our targets, but only if others put ambitious commitments on the table as well.  I think the European Council achieved very important results, namely on two matters. First, on finance, the Council was able successfully to put together a faststart finance package, bigger than expected and, critically, with every Member State involved. Of course, some have said that this is not enough coming from the European Union, but EUR  7 . 2  billion, more than USD  10  billion in the current circumstances, and for three years, is a very serious commitment. I hope the money is now guaranteed, not just an aspiration. It is now for others to match it. The European Council also reiterated its commitment for mediumterm financing, to ensure it gives the fair contribution that is necessary for  2020 .  Second, action on climate has sometimes been a divisive point for the European Council. However, the atmosphere this time was different. There was a strong shared sense that everyone has an interest in the European Union pulling its weight. We should now be getting the benefits from the investment we have made as the pioneers in this agenda.  What I did find generally encouraging was recognition that the European Union has to stand together. Let us hope that this determination holds firm under the pressures of the next two or three days.  What can we expect over the next few days? Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark will probably put forward a text today  but with a lot of the key numbers still left blank. The leaders task will be to move this forward to a deal. This is why I am going to Copenhagen immediately after this debate. Together with Prime Minister Reinfeldt, we will do our best for the European Union to lead this debate.  We know that the atmosphere at the moment is not easy at Copenhagen. We also know that this is part of the usual rhythm of a top negotiation. However, the arrival of so many Heads of State or Government will be a powerful driver to reach a deal. If that deal includes real commitment to cut emissions from both developed and developing countries; a clear commitment on financing to make this happen; and an agreement on how this is to be applied and verified  if this agreement includes the different elements of the Bali road map and can be seen to be in the right ball park to respect the  2  C limit, then I think we will say rightly that it will be a major achievement. We are not there yet, but I believe it is possible to reach that agreement.  The next few days will show whether the ambitions we have discussed in this Parliament so often are going to be realised, but I sense already that there is a compelling need for change and that we need to make this success in Copenhagen. There is a huge amount at stake. There is, of course, a balance to be found, but there is also a sense that todays generation knows that there is a challenge which cannot be avoided. I believe last weeks European Council left the European Union ready to meet the challenge. I hope that with European leadership, we will achieve success at Copenhagen.
10021769 author: Frederic McNabb:  VicePresident designate of the Commission.  Let me start with Afghanistan. We are at an important point in our relations here. Our future support must help build a government that is responsive to the needs and the concerns of the Afghan people. As the situation is volatile, we need to both work with, and to influence, the situation on the ground. That is what the international conferences, which begin with a conference in London next month, are all about.  We are ready to put in more resources. The Commission is raising its development assistance by one third to EUR  200  million. We need these extra resources to repeat the successes, like the extension of the primary health care system to  80  of Afghans  including far better treatment for women and girls  and recent success in turning provinces poppy free. Our Member States have also committed to help get our police training programme up to strength.  But that is all just the start. We need to deliver this as part of a coherent EU contribution within a coordinated international response. This response must have the Afghans working with the UN at the centre of it.  The action plan agreed by the Council in October gives us the opportunity to do this. Together with the US efforts and NATO security operations, it sends a strong message to the region and international community about our commitment. It also, of course, dovetails the priorities set out by President Karzai, particularly in the fields of improved governance and anticorruption.  The plan confirms that we will continue to place key sectors such as the rule of law and agriculture at the centre of our engagement.  We are already assisting the government to improve the skills of administrators in Kabul. We will now start to roll these skills out across the provinces to help the Afghan people manage their own affairs and ensure the government provides  and is seen to provide  services to them.  The plan sends a message that we will support the integration of insurgents who are ready to respond to President Karzais call to work with his government.  The European Electoral Observation Mission also presents its report in Kabul today and I would like to pay tribute to Mr Berman and his team for a job well done in extremely difficult circumstances. We will ensure follow up, since it is clear the credibility of the government and the political system rests upon a major overhaul of the electoral system.  Finally on Afghanistan, but perhaps most importantly, we are streamlining our structures on the ground. Member States will align policies with the resources to back them, and I hope to merge the EU Special Representative and the Head of the EU Delegation into a single post as soon as possible. That will help us to build a coherent approach that can serve as a model for elsewhere.  Turning to Pakistan, our overriding concern and interest is that Pakistan should be a stable democracy free from terror and able to join with its neighbours in defence against common threats.  The action plan underlines this and builds on existing commitments made at the June EUPakistan Summit, including humanitarian aid, reconstruction support, assistance to the police and judiciary and strengthening democratic institutions and civil society to improve human rights, as well as agreements on trade and socioeconomic development. We will continue to support the implementation of the recommendations of the  2008  election observation mission.  The action plan is backed up by a substantial financial resource of just under EUR  500  million from the Commission until  2013 , plus a EUR  100  million renewable energy loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as commitments to deepen our trade and political relations. The action plan also specifies intensified dialogue on all these issues and there should be a second summit next year within the Spanish Presidency.  The action plan also makes clear that the European Union will use its expertise in regional integration to help Afghanistan, Pakistan and their neighbours to kickstart economic relations, particularly with India. There will be no overnight solution to current tensions but we must make a start to overcoming distrust. The potential gains from this kind of regional cooperation in terms of trade and investment would dwarf anything we can do as the European Union.  In conclusion, implementation of the plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan is central to our future engagement in these countries. It is a joint endeavour between Member States and the EU institutions and it is the first of its kind, which, if successful, can help shape the international civilian response to crises that have so far largely been defined in military terms.  The action plan amounts to a major commitment not only to Afghanistan and Pakistan, but to south and central Asia as a whole. But we need more than ideas to deliver: we need the right people and the right skills, and they need security in order to work. There must be stronger political engagement by the host governments, and stronger coherence among donors, including internally among Member States.  South Asia faces extremism every day, whether on the battlefield in Helmand or on the streets of Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi. We will not tackle this through military action alone but by helping build a secure and safe environment free from the tensions and inequalities that feed extremism.  Europe has much to offer from our own experience. The action plan provides us with the opportunity to use this experience to help others, and I hope Parliament will support it.
5977239 author: Lynne Bush:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, dear colleagues, Council President, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to discuss with you today our very important but also our very challenging relationship with Belarus. I think it is important because Belarus lies at a crossroads on our continent; and it is challenging because Belarus own choices for its own future, and for its relationship with the EU, remain unclear. It still remains to be seen what they will be, so we will have to go on working with them.  Over the last two years, the European Union has sought gradually to engage with Belarus and to encourage further reforms, to build on the, I have to say, modest measures taken so far. I am convinced that the most productive approach to Belarus will be one based on pragmatism. Our engagement with that country needs to reflect positive steps by Belarus itself, but we also have to show at least some flexibility.  We have signalled clearly that we would like to see Belarus take its place as a fully fledged participant in the European neighbourhood policy, and that the bilateral track of the Eastern Partnership can be opened to Belarus if it shows through sustained action its wish to make irreversible steps towards democratic reform.  In the meantime, we have shown our goodwill in a number of important ways. A number of EU highlevel visits to Belarus this year helped strengthen political exchanges. We launched a dialogue on human rights issues in June  2009 . The Commission is engaged in a growing number of technical dialogues with Belarus on issues of mutual interest.  Last month, for instance, the External Relations Council decided to extend existing restrictive measures, notably the visa ban and the assets freeze, till October  2010 , given the lack of significant progress on human rights and fundamental freedoms.  However, to encourage democratic progress, the Council also extended the suspension of the restrictive measures. And the Council also took two further decisions to encourage Belarus to stay on the path of reforms. I very much welcome that the Commission can now start working on the visa facilitation issue, and on a shadow ENP action plan, the joint interim plan. These steps provide an incentive for moves towards democracy in Belarus, which I am confident will be well understood, on the one hand, by the government, but, on the other hand, particularly by the people.  The joint interim plan will be developed with both the authorities and civil society in Belarus, and I hope it will open the door to deeper dialogue with Belarus, including on delicate political issues.  My services are preparing recommendations with a view to negotiating directives on visa facilitation and readmission agreements. Visa facilitation is a priority for the Belarusian people, and I would like to see more Belarusians visiting the European Union, travelling freely, studying and doing business. But naturally, the final decision on the negotiation directives will lie with the Council.  In addition, the Commission is prepared to increase the allocations of financial assistance to Belarus for the period of  20102013 . We have proposed a package of macrofinancial assistance worth EUR  200  million, for which we are seeking the approval of Parliament. The Commission is supporting the idea of the EIB including Belarus in the Banks new mandate. I really hope this will go further.  However, if Belarus wishes to come closer to the EU, it is clear it must show this through its actions. There must be an end to political prisoners and politically motivated prosecutions. Reform of the electoral legislation in line with OSCEODIHR recommendations is sorely needed. The liberty of the press, freedom of speech and of assembly should be permitted and become the norm. The European Union also encourages Belarus to abolish or declare a moratorium on the death penalty. We call for improved conditions for NGOs, civil society and human rights activists. All these steps could play their part in accelerating the development of a closer partnership between Belarus and the European Union.  In conclusion, therefore, our offer to Belarus is clear. The European Union is ready to work closely with Minsk and support its political and economic development. But we would welcome significant positive steps from the Belarus leadership which would allow us to develop our relationship in the same way as we do with other eastern partners if they play their part.
9232355 author: Philip Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, in conclusion, I would like to stress that I found  and I am also speaking on behalf of Benita FerreroWaldner, of course  our exchanges today to be very frank and extremely useful. I wish to thank you for a constructive and forwardlooking debate.  The EU is, in principle, ready to work closely with Minsk and support urgently needed political and economic reforms. Should there be significant steps from the Belarusian leadership in terms of democratisation, the EU would be prepared to see Belarus as a full member of the Eastern Partnership. In the meantime, the EU is, and will be, urging Belarus to take further irreversible steps towards democratic standards, without which our relationship cannot develop to its full potential. I sincerely hope that in  2010 , we will be in a position to engage gradually and intelligently with Belarus and offer the Belarusian people a vision and tangible benefits of a close relationship with the EU.  The EU expects Belarus to take a series of accompanying measures in the area of democratic reforms, with a view to coming closer to the EU and together help expand the area of peace, stability and prosperity involving all six Eastern Partnership countries, as well as Russia, the EUs strategic partner.  There are five measures we expect Belarus to take resolutely and irreversibly.  Firstly, to ensure there is no backtracking on political prisoners and politically motivated criminal prosecution. Secondly, carry out a thorough reform of the electoral legislation in line with OSCEODIHR recommendations. Thirdly, embark upon the liberalisation of the media environment, uphold freedom of speech and of assembly. Fourthly, improve through regulatory and legislative measures working conditions for NGOs. Fifthly, abolish or declare a moratorium on the death penalty.  A significant move in showing Belarus commitment to shared values would be the immediate introduction of a moratorium on the death penalty and its subsequent abolition as a crucial step forward on its path to Council of Europe membership. In its November conclusions, the Council of the EU urged Belarus to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty. Moreover, the Commission has carried out communication actions in the wake of the  10 th International Day against the Death Penalty.  What could the EU do for Belarus? What is on offer? The Commission believes that the most productive approach to Belarus will be one based on pragmatism. Progressive EU engagement with Belarus needs to reflect positive steps by Belarus itself, but we also need to show flexibility. The November  2009  conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) allow the EU to offer incentives to Belarus for steps we want to see, while remaining true to our principles. This is what I mean by pragmatism.  Our message to Belarus is clear. First, the EU is ready to work closely with Minsk and support its political and economic development and, should there be significant positive steps from the Belarusian leadership, we would be prepared to see Belarus as a full member of the Eastern Partnership. This would entail the development of our relationship through the bilateral track of the EAP, the launching of a thorough political and economic dialogue, as well as enhanced sectoral cooperation.  In the meantime, Belarus was invited in May  2009  to join the multilateral dimension of the EAP. It is participating constructively at deputy minister level in the four multilateral forums  democracy and governance, economic integration, energy security and peopletopeople contacts.  Secondly, we expect Belarus to take further irreversible steps towards democratic standards, without which our relationship cannot develop to its full potential.  Thirdly, the absence of a PCA is not only a loss to Belarus; it deprives us of a legal basis for structures like a formal human rights dialogue and addressing trade or energy transit issues. In the Commission, we continue to believe that the ratification of the PCA will be a useful step forward, but clearly we will continue to use this as an incentive lever to encourage further moves on the Belarusian side.  Fourthly, and lastly, the Commission has started working on the implementation of the November  2009  GAERC conclusions, and will come back to the Council of EU Ministers with proposals as soon as possible.
8287777 author: Marc Finlayson:  author.  Mr President, with your permission, I would propose that we delay a moment or two because this is an oral question to the Commission and we were hoping that Mr McCreevy would be here, but I see that Mr Samecki is going to speak. I have not met Mr Samecki before, so I am interested that he is here to provide an answer to an issue that Mr McCreevy and his team have been working on. Thank you very much.  I was going to have welcomed Mr McCreevy here and thanked him for his work previously, so perhaps you will pass on our good wishes for what might have been his final appearance here. Nevertheless, I am particularly pleased that Mr Barnier has joined us as a very active member of my committee to hear this, because this is a dossier which will be very much in his intray, assuming of course that the Parliament approves his nomination and the Commission moves forward. It is nevertheless very good that he is here.  The free movement of professionals and the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications are among the flagship issues that my committee is most concerned about in the whole construction of the single market. It is very appropriate that we are discussing this question to the Commission this morning, which is essentially to ask for an update on the progress in transposing the revised directive that my committee worked on back in  20042005 , and on how that is actually being implemented by the Member States. It is also very timely because Professor Monti came to our committee on Monday to talk about his mission for the President of the Commission on the future direction of the internal market. He made a very strong point that part of the problem with the internal market is actually not the lack of legislation, but the consistent enforcement and effectiveness of the existing instruments that we have in place to create the internal market.  In the case of the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, as the text of our question quite clearly sets out, we already know that a significant number of problems in relation to recognition of professional qualifications are encountered by citizens across the European Union. It has one of the highest levels of complaints in the Solvit mechanism that we very much support at member government level. Many people feel frustrated by the absence of clear decisions and also by the lack of contact between authorisation bodies in different Member States. One of the things that our own research has done, and this committee commissioned research on this topic, is to demonstrate the fact that there is nothing like enough coordinated activity on helping people to recognise their rights under mutual recognition. The other aspect is that it is also clear from the work we and others have done that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European qualifications framework. There are serious questions that we need to ask about the mechanism, about how simple it is to access and about how effective it is in practical terms. We know from the statistics and the information  and I am sure we will hear from the Commission shortly  that transposition of this instrument has been delayed in just about every Member State. It has taken much longer than people expected to bring this into operation, and that of itself raises concerns about the complexity of the instrument itself.  Just to pull all these things together in the context of the work of the Internal Market Committee over the next five years, I am delighted that, I think, all the coordinators of the committee are here today and I want to thank them for the work they have done, together with myself, on shaping the forward agenda for this committee. This question of mutual recognition of professional qualifications is not just a oneoff. It is part of our feeling that the role of our committee is to continue to investigate, to promote and to make recommendations about the future evolution of the key legislations, the key building blocks of the single market.  We know that the Commission is due to review the mutual recognition directive in  2011 . We plan to have a meeting of national parliaments and national parliamentarians to discuss this proposal. We have already had a hearing on this and we have our research report. These are the instruments that my committee can use and, if the coordinators agree, I am sure that we will be doing an owninitiative report sometime in  2010  to feed into this discussion that the Commission will have.  That is the context of the question. We look forward to hearing the Commissions reply to set the framework for that, but this is just the beginning of the process and I am sure that the new Commissioner will be able to take that forward and work with us to really develop this crucial piece of legislation and make the single market work better.
4000097 author: Frederic Jones:  author.  Mr President, three years ago, a major reform of European cohesion policy was introduced taking into account the unprecedented enlargement of the Union and new emerging challenges.  It was not by chance that, back in  2005  and  2006 , the top priorities for European cohesion policy were: the Lisbon strategy, innovation and competitiveness, climate change, energy security and efficiency, water efficiency, investment in new skills, attractiveness of territories for young people, and quality of life.  It is because we have understood that the mission of cohesion policy is to anticipate change, not to follow it, that we have put on the cohesion policy agenda for  20072013  all those priorities which we see today in the Commissions Europe  2020  agenda.  That is why, more than two years ago, the Regions  2020  analytical report was published. The purpose was to know what the cohesion policy priorities should be after  2013 . Today, we are well prepared to face the future.  A year ago, the policy put all its assets at the disposal of the European Recovery Package, thereby also providing the essential link between the exit strategy from a real economic crisis, on the one hand, and longterm sustainable growth and structural transformation on the other.  But our oral question is about the future. In years to come, the Europe we live in will be in need of strong collective action to respond to the expectations of its citizens, who are today informed citizens, fully aware of how much depends on choices made by policy makers. Those expectations are confirmed by public opinion polls.  Jacques Delors once said that the European single market is about competition that stimulates, about cooperation that makes us stronger and about solidarity that makes us united. European cohesion that makes the single market work is delivered by the European regional policy, which is today based exactly on this triple foundation: competitiveness, cooperation and solidarity.  For years, we have talked about the need to unlock, to mobilise, the development potential of all European regions and cities. Experience and logic clearly show that this mobilisation turns out to be most effective and efficient if pursued through the direct engagement of subnational levels of European governments.  The European regional policy has already passed the subsidiarity test. Subsidiarity works for Europe.  The  2006  reform of cohesion policy has made it a modern placebased policy founded on a balance between equity and efficiency, between bottomup and topdown approaches, between common strategic European objectives and local flexibility.  There is a need to move further on those issues, to continue the reform of policy governance, but certain principles should not be abandoned. The new treaty has cemented the new understanding of European subsidiarity already deeply rooted in the cohesion policy, that is, subsidiarity extended to local and regional levels of governance.  We can do more on it, especially with regard to the local level. Those who suggest that cohesion policy can be limited to Brussels and national level either do not know the European reality, or do not understand that excluding local and regional Europe from the pursuit of common European objectives is economically at best unwise and politically dangerous.  Cohesion is a notion that excludes exclusion. For political, economic, social and legitimacy reasons, cohesion policy must not be divisive: it should be a policy for all, as the internal market is, as the common currency is.  All elements of this integration triangle  common market, common currency, cohesion  are mutually strengthening and interdependent. They are our common European public good.  We policy makers have raised the stakes by promising to deliver. The challenges are well known; the EU  2020  strategy has been opened to public consultations.  Development policy with clear targets and tools is needed. Cohesion policy is a policy for development that engages all levels of European governance working in concert for European citizens.  To conclude, Europe needs new energy to take care of its future, to renew itself in an assertive way. It is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come from. For me, the answer is clear. Today, this energy should come from below. Today this energy can be released through the direct engagement of local and regional levels of European governance in the pursuit of common European objectives.
6781089 author: Lynne Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, the questions put forward are very pertinent. They underline the importance you attach to cohesion policy as well as your dedication to keep the policy at the heart of European integration.  As regards your question on multilevel governance, multilevel governance has been recognised as a fundamental mechanism in delivering EU policy priorities. The growing interdependence between different levels of government in the Union was stressed by the consultation paper launched by the Commission on the EU  2020  strategy.  Cohesion policy is a good example of multilevel governance. It offers a governance system which values and exploits local and regional knowledge, combines it with strategic direction from the Community level, and coordinates interventions between levels of government.  The strengths of multilevel governance were also stressed by the Committee of the Regions in its White Paper of June  2009 , where it called on the Union to strengthen mechanisms of multilevel governance and pointed to the leverage effects generated by cohesion policy, which contributed to the implementation of other Community policies as well.  On your two questions concerning the eventual abandonment of Objective  2  and the eligibility of all European regions, in the period  20072013 , all regions are eligible for structural funds support. Concerning the period post 2013 , there is no official Commission position at this stage.  As regards your third question on the weakening of the principle of additionality, additionality is one of the basic principles of cohesion policy. It ensures that the structural funds do not replace the public or equivalent structural expenditure by a Member State. Thus, it guarantees the genuine economic impact of EU interventions and provides cohesion policy with an important European added value.  As to your question on the regional dimension of cohesion policy after  2013 , the Lisbon Treaty maintains the objective of reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the leastfavoured regions as part of the Unions remit on economic, social and territorial cohesion under Article  174 .  In addition, Article  176  points out that the European Regional Development Fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions.  As regards your question on the involvement of regional and local levels of governance in the pursuit of European objectives within the framework of post 2013  cohesion policy, once again, I would like to draw your attention to the Commissions consultation paper on the EU  2020  strategy, which looks for the active support of stakeholders, such as the social partners and civil society, and recognises that the takeup of the EU  2020  vision across all the regions of the EU will also be crucial to its success.  The Commission has not yet developed a position on what role cohesion policy will play in the delivery of the EU  2020  strategy. But the cohesion policy has the capacity to mobilise regional or local actors across all boundaries in pursuit of European objectives.  In relation to your question whether the Commission intends to publish a White Paper on Territorial Cohesion, at the current stage, a separate White Paper on Territorial Cohesion is not foreseen. Policy conclusions resulting from the public debate on the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion will instead be incorporated in the comprehensive cohesion policy legislative package for post 2013  prepared in the context of the Fifth Cohesion Report which, according to the new treaty, is due for submission in  2010 .  On your question concerning the role of the European Social Fund in cohesion policy, in pursuing the objective of balanced and sustainable development, cohesion policy plays a crucial role in the delivery of European priorities. This is also the case for the European Social Fund, which will continue to pursue its objectives as defined by Title XI of the new treaty.  Achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion requires appropriate policies and a mix of investments from various levels. Human capital investments financed by the ESF form an essential component of this policy mix in the context of the global knowledgebased economy.  With regard to your question on the role of cohesion policy in relation to other EU policies, cohesion policy provides the EU with its largest source of investment in the real economy. The December  2008  communication of the Commission on Cohesion policy: investing in real economy, underlined the importance of the policy for focusing on the EU Lisbon Agenda delivery, investing in people, business, research and innovation, priority infrastructures and energy.  The Commissions current focus is on ensuring that the implementation of the planned investments can be delivered in partnership with national and regional authorities as effectively as possible. This effort involves close cooperation between relevant Commission services and between the Commission and relevant regional and local authorities.  A practical example of cooperation between the Commission services is the Practical Guide to EU funding opportunities for research and innovation published in  2007 , which was conceived to help potential beneficiaries to find their way through the three funding Community instruments and provides policy makers with advice on coordinated access to those instruments.  As far as the ESF is concerned, the close alignment of its priorities with the Employment Guidelines provides for a direct link between EU employment policy priorities and EU financial support.  Complementarity also exists between actions supported by the cohesion policy and by the rural development policy as clearly set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines of both policies.  I hope that I have responded to some of your questions and I look forward to an interesting debate.
6646104 author: Claire Smith:  on behalf of the EFD Group.  Mr President, regarding post 2013  cohesion policy, a leaked draft budgetary document entitled A Reform Agenda for a Global Europe reveal that EU funding from  2013  onwards could change entirely to a nationally coordinated rather than regionally allocated distribution.  The draft abandons regional and local level control in multilevel governance, overturning the shared management principle. Instead, a sectoral approach to the new budget is adopted rather than operating independently within current structures.  The proposal to limit the policy to national level would lead to qualifying Member States governing redistribution. Not only does this mean that net contributors will lose further return funding, but those Member States expected to join the European Union under future expansion would enter membership under cohesion funding likely to remain for the forthcoming budgetary duration.  As a result, those countries who currently shoulder a large proportion of the Unions financial burden, like the UK, will discover they must finance an everincreasing pool of Member States qualifying for support.  Even fewer will have to carry even more, with a possible loss of the rebate for the UK. With more countries queuing up to join the EU, I am concerned Wales will see much needed support go to newer Member States.  It is no surprise that some of Europes richest countries like Norway and Switzerland have given the European Union a wide berth, knowing that they would be paying to fund their poorer neighbours. But Wales cannot afford to pay if nothing is paid back out.  The move reinforces the European Unions increasing ambition to become further integrated, centralised and federal, yet abandons the regional dimension of cohesion policy which underpins the European Unions pledge to support territorial cohesion and deliver benefits to all members.  Instead the EU, like a wolf in sheeps clothing, is covertly abandoning cooperation and compromise in favour of consolidation.  Whereas the people of Europe were told the Union  on the grounds that it enhanced trade links  strengthened agriculture ties and promoted equality, the machinations of an increasing bureaucratic global Europe see the focus on farming and regional development decrease in favour of an unwanted ambitious global strategy, including increased emigration to countries like the UK.  Larger shares of the EU budget will need to be devoted to such an agenda at the expense of regions such as Wales. The last payments to projects under the  20072013  EU structural funds programmes will be made in  2015 . There is uncertainty over what, if any, subsequent EU funding will be available to Wales in future funding rounds.  The implication that cohesion might disappear entirely from richer nations with no mention at all of transitional funding would further disenfranchise the people of the UK.  The disproportionate membership bill would be better steered towards funding economic development through selfsufficiency determined by the UK itself.  The EU budget review set to be published in the spring will likely see every government in Europe declare the necessity for increased public sector borrowing. It seems increasingly likely that the level of funding available to Wales will reduce substantially.  The consequences will include reductions in programme budgets, less investment in the wider economy in Wales, and broadreaching loss of jobs connected to programme management and project delivery.  Rather than having any sort of beneficial effect on my constituents, the EU will serve a glancing blow to the people of Wales if they decide to pull the rug from under our feet. The likely result of the reduction in funding to Wales and the UK will have a major impact on our country as a whole which will affect the farming sector as well.  It now must be time that the people of Wales and the UK have a referendum on its relations with the European Union so the people can decide if they want to be governed by Westminster or Brussels.
3982773 author: Philip Green:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, let me start by underlining the unprecedented nature of this disaster  in terms of humanitarian impact, but also in terms of the impact on the country as a whole.  Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. It is a country in a chronically fragile situation whose existing basic functions and capacities have been very seriously disrupted. Also, the international community has been hard hit. Staff of the United Nations and NGOs and our own Commission staff are still missing, and this also explains the difficulties of organising aid on the spot. People have to understand that it is not out of a lack of competence, but because the aid community has itself been hit. Relief operations are not flowing as speedily as one would wish, although one sees that this is getting better by the hour.  In other words, this is not only about saving human lives. We have, in fact, to save the country as a whole. That is why the High Representative, Cathy Ashton, called for this extraordinary Council meeting, which was a very useful tool in addressing the problem. Let me just very briefly focus on four main challenges.  First, we have, of course, to address humanitarian needs. These are enormous and concern chiefly emergency medical care for the injured, water and sanitation  because there is risk of cholera, for example  food and shelter. What is lacking most is surgery, primary health care and drugs, water treatment kits, food assistance, emergency shelter and logistics support. What is in enough supply is searchandrescue capacity.  The organisational coordinating efforts priorities are to complete the needs assessment, to have a better picture of the detailed needs and to organise the transport logistics. That will also be addressed within the framework of the EU institutions.  Lastly, we have to organise the coordination of international relief efforts. That is always very difficult in these kinds of circumstances. Let me stress that, only hours after the earthquake, European ECHO and MIC teams were deployed on the spot. They have been working there ever since to contribute to needs assessment and aid coordination. We are working with teams from OCHA, a United Nations organisation, and are in constant contact with John Holmes, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator.  The second point is to build, or rebuild, the basic state capacity. This is very important. This country has to function again, not only physically  most of the buildings have disappeared  but with a lot of high officials having gone missing and state structures having been severely disrupted.  The Council welcomes the fact that we will urgently send a team of EU experts with the specific task of assessing the most critical needs of the Haitian state and civil administration in order to provide technical assistance. Our diplomatic and cooperation staff on the ground are, of course, best placed to do that, but their capacity is overstretched. This is something that will become more and more important in the coming days. As the European Union and the European Commission, together with the Council, we could play a leadership role in reestablishing state institutions physically, and also in terms of people.  Third is, of course, the plan to reconstruct the country, where we have to look beyond the immediate relief phase. In a few weeks, many emergency teams and means deployed at the present time will have left and there is a risk  very typical of this kind of disaster  of a secondwave disaster if we do not sustain our assistance and support.  We must immediately set up massive, coordinated medium and longterm common EU response plans for the crisis. Our services are working on this. This should be designed to ensure a proper division of labour among EU institutions and Member States and to ensure a linked relief rehabilitation and development approach, with a sustained and seamless transition between immediate relief and postemergency response.  We have been calling on all the Member States to fully engage in these efforts, and to turn into actions all our commitments for coordination and aid effectiveness. This is a time when the strength of our commitments will be tested and must come out strong if we are to succeed.  Lastly, the financial response. As the High Representative has already outlined, the European Commission will make a major contribution, first of all in terms of humanitarian aid  EUR  30  million, of which the largest part  EUR  22  million to be exact  is completely fresh money that comes on top of the already existing humanitarian engagements we have with Haiti. The early recovery assistance  which is not humanitarian assistance, and what I just said about the state institutions of course comes under this umbrella  amounting to EUR  100  million, with a  5050  balance between money redirected and fresh money, and then the longerterm reconstruction assistance, where there is now an initial amount of EUR  200  million.  Then we will have to see where we stand. Now one is hearing figures in the region of USD  10  billion. That seems a lot to me and, in any case, cannot be matched by the Commission budget. We will have to see with the Pledging conference and with the Member States how exactly we are going to eventually participate in higher sums. That is the EUwide package that has now been prepared on top of all the contributions that are already being made and will be made by the Member States.  As the High Representative said, I will be going to the region  Haiti and also the Dominican Republic  tomorrow morning to have discussions with the authorities, including on the efforts to try to rebuild the state institutions. The President and major NGOs are on the spot. I will also go to the Dominican Republic. It is important that we also see those authorities, because they are the neighbours. You can already see that the situation might eventually create some overstretching at the border, so I will also see the Dominican authorities.  That is all I have to say at the moment. On my return, I will report back to the Development Committee, on the Monday afternoon.
2065759 author: James Green:  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyVicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, as I began, I wanted to come to this House to hear the views. I take on board and understand the frustration that honourable Members feel, that there are issues which could be handled better.  Members asked questions about visibility and coordination. There is no question that, because America is closer, because it has the capacity to mobilise as quickly as it did, then the pictures you will see on your television screens will be of them. The fact that we worked so closely and collaboratively with the United States is also an important part of what we do now and in the future.  And there is also no question that, as I was woken in the night to be told of the earthquake, we mobilised our people as quickly as we possibly could. Twentyone Member States were mobilised to respond. We had work done, with the Council and Commission side coming together for the very first time, and may I just say, it is only eight days since I was before you in my hearing here.  Twentyone Member States with  11  searchandrescue teams, five field hospitals, six advance medical posts,  40  medical teams, six waterpurification units; we despatched these as quickly as we could and I pay tribute to the Member States for the work they do. I also pay tribute to the officials who worked and have continued to work day and night to pull this effort together.  I put the question very early to the United Nations on the ground, and to SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon, where best my efforts could be. There was no doubt that I had nothing to contribute on the ground other than to take up valuable space when planes were circling the airfield unable to land because of the state of the airfield at the present time. I am not a doctor. I am not a firefighter. My place was to bring together the coordination, to be talking to the Friends of Haiti Group, to be coordinating with the United States to make sure that we put in the maximum effort on the ground.  I also pay tribute, as honourable Members have done, to the NGOs and to the people on the ground. The devastation that happened on the ground had enormous impact on the United Nations, which has lost many members of their senior staff, and on NGOs, which have been unable to respond as quickly as they would simply because people of theirs have died.  That has made it very difficult, as you have watched and we have watched people desperate for help, wondering where the help is. Getting the help out in these circumstances has been incredibly difficult, and again people have worked tirelessly to provide it. Now things are getting easier, the help is getting out, but do not underestimate for one moment how difficult the circumstances have been on the ground.  Did it work well? Yes. Am I satisfied? No. As I start my first weeks in this job, I say to you very clearly: I hear what you say. I hear the frustration. I understand it. And you are right to criticise me that it is not as good as it can be in the future. You are right. It should, and must, get better and better.  What I have to do is take what happened and learn the lessons of it now in order to make sure that we do more in the future to pull together, but I take nothing away from the tremendous work that was done and is being done hour by hour and day by day.  For the long term, honourable Members are absolutely right. When the cameras have gone, we need to be there. We need to be there physically, we need to be there in terms of the support we can give. I agree that debt issues need to be a part of the discussions that take place. I agree that what is done must be done in partnership with the Haitian people with due respect for them. I agree on the importance of rebuilding the infrastructure, and I agree that we have to ensure that the role of the United Nations is recognised and make sure that they are able to fulfil it well.  That is why I am going not only to the United States to see Secretary of State Clinton but also to the United Nations to talk with the SecretaryGeneral and the key people about what we can now do to pull together for the future because that, as you say, will be of enormous importance.  Let me finish on the reality of the situation. As honourable Members have said, this is a country where over  70  of people were already living below the poverty line. It is very important, as honourable Members have said, that the children, the orphan children especially, are cared for properly, and the devastation will require support in the years ahead.  Let me just tell you a little bit about the infrastructure at the moment. Hospitals, electricity, communications, water supply, seaports and airports have been badly damaged. The main official buildings, the Presidential Palace, the Parliament, Ministries of Treasury, Justice, Planning, Health and Interior are completely destroyed. Many of the high government officials are missing. The capacities of the Haitian Government are not functioning. It is, as you said, already one of the poorest countries in the world, and because we need to rebuild that infrastructure, I share your commitment to make sure that we do.  (Applause)
5305526 author: Christoph Whittacker:  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyVicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, honourable Members, this is an important opportunity to raise the situation in Iran.  The European Union wants normal relations with Iran, and our efforts on the nuclear issue are part of that. In this context, I will continue, in my capacity as High Representative, the role of my predecessor, Javier Solana, in the international talks with Iran.  Iran is an important country with a deep history and rich culture, and a remarkably talented population. The films and books coming out of Iran are impressive, the level of education of women is high, there is a capacity for public debate and the young population is vibrant and active. In many ways, Iranian society has the hallmarks and the capacity of a free society. The threat to the society has been reflected in the turmoil that followed what many in Iran saw as a fraudulent election last year. That, of course, is a matter for the Iranians. Our concern is that international norms and standards on civil and political rights must be respected.  In this respect, I am deeply concerned over the reports of violent suppression of demonstrations and arbitrary detentions in Tehran and other Iranian cities during the recent Ashura commemorations at the end of December. The use of violence against demonstrators seeking to exercise their freedom of expression and rights of assembly is not acceptable. These are universal human rights that must be respected and those detained for peacefully exercising those rights should be released.  I also note with deep concern that many arrests seem to have targeted human rights defenders and journalists, and that many detained are denied access to legal representation and contact with their families. Iran must live up to its international obligations and treat detained persons in accordance with international human rights standards.  Another recent issue is the detention of another  12  members of the Bahai religious community. These people must be assured a just, open and fair trial in accordance with international standards.  The EU has spared no opportunity to ask the Iranian Government to respect those international obligations which they freely and voluntarily adhered to. We issue public statements and use other diplomatic means. We work through the United Nations: the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the situation only last month. We will make full use of the upcoming review of Iran which will be held at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in early February.  On the nuclear issue, we regret that Tehran has not followed up on the last meeting between Javier Solana and Jalili, the chief negotiator, on  1  October in Geneva. We all assessed that the meeting was positive. But, in effect, Iran has now rejected a draft agreement proposed by the IAEA and has been refusing to pursue talks on the nuclear issue.  The EU and its negotiating partners are all committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, and to that end, we must continue to implement the dualtrack approach. We need a serious engagement in meaningful talks from Tehrans side.  Our objective remains to build confidence that the nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. The confidence deficit was further increased by the revelation that Iran has been building another enrichment facility without informing the IAEA in due time. In addition, Iran continues not to cooperate fully with the IAEA and not to respect its international obligations.  It is vital that the EU and the international community stand united behind the negotiating effort, including by supporting that effort through appropriate measures. The widest possible unity is key if we are to achieve our objective.  If Iran sets out on a more constructive course on the nuclear issue and on regional stability in general, it could play an important role in the Middle East and Gulf region, which would reflect its rightful place and proud history.  In conclusion, the challenges posed by Iran weigh very heavy in my portfolio. This is a country which has enormous potential  and our readiness to engage with Iran constructively has been made over and over. I shall continue to make that case. I sincerely hope that, during the time of my mandate, I will return to this House with a more positive picture of relations with Iran.
266568 author: Helen White:  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyVicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, I think this has been an extremely important and timely debate, first of all, because we have reiterated the commitment that we have in the European Union to the importance of the values of human rights.  And indeed, in our dialogue with Iran, we ask nothing more than that they live up to the international agreements which they have willingly and voluntarily signed, and that is a fundamental part of the way in which we have to approach these questions, and Members have, both by naming individuals and by describing events in Iran, highlighted the issues which are of the greatest concern to us.  Members, too, have made the point that in the end, as you said, Mr Gualtieri, the dialogue must be inevitable. It is very important that we continue to offer the approach that says meaningful dialogue. But I do so recognising that my predecessor, Javier Solana, spent six years in dialogue, six years offering to continue that debate; so, dialogue, but not as an excuse for inaction on behalf of Iran, but rather as a means of making sure that we develop the strength of that relationship and that we achieve what we believe to be important.  And as part of that, the talks on World Trade Organisation membership, which have been going nowhere for a long time, could be a way in which we could find the kind of debate and discussion and support to enable the regime to move forward.  Many Members have talked about the importance of sanctions, but I think particularly  intelligent, smart sanctions: the critical importance to all of us of ensuring, as we begin to think about what next, and, if we do, and as we do, consider the possibility of sanctions, that we do so recognising that they must be aimed and targeted specifically to achieve what we wish and that no one in this House wishes to see ordinary people in Iran suffer as a consequence of that.  That makes that debate very important, but also requires us to invest energy and time within it. The E 33  senior officials met in New York on Saturday and we were able to have the dialogue, including, of course, with Russia, on that issue.  There is no doubt, as I have said, that, though we wish to take forward the meaningful relationship with Iran through dialogue, ultimately, if Iran rejects this, then, under the dualtrack policy that we have, the question of sanctions arises and, indeed, as a consequence of that meeting, consideration of the appropriate further measures has already begun.  This, too, will be an item for discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, and that is partly why I was so keen to hear honourable Members views as I prepare for those discussions too.  In terms of the delegation going to the country, Mrs Lochbihler, you are indeed the chair of the delegation. It is very important that it has not yet officially been cancelled. I think it would be important to consider whether we should pursue that. I hope that meeting can take place soon, again in the spirit of trying to keep the dialogue open.  We do, as a result specifically of the action of this Parliament, have Euronews beginning its broadcasts in Farsi in the middle of  2010 . That is important, too, in terms of communication and looking at how we use communication and technology effectively.  It is difficult to think about blocking access if, at the same time, we block the access to the information that people wish to get, and that, I think, is something we have to be mindful of.  And in terms of looking at what we do for the future, honourable Members have made it clear what they wish us to consider. As I have said, the E 33  is already considering these options. We have the Foreign Affairs Council. I have indicated we want to look at smart, intelligent sanctions as we consider this dual track. I have made it clear, and I continue to make it clear, that I am open and ready to have the dialogue  and I described in my opening remarks the potential of this great country  but we do so in the certain knowledge that we cannot continue to use dialogue as a way of preventing action.  I have to end by saying I was very struck by the phrase that President Obama used in his Nobel Prize reception speech when he said that, when we look at the value of continuing with engagement, engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation. But ... no repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door.  The door is open for that meaningful dialogue in order to move forward but, in saying that, I am absolutely committed to recognising the twin track that my predecessors laid out and to pursuing that as necessary.
6077628 author: Jennifer Merx:  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyVicePresident of the Commission.  Madam President, once again, an important and wideranging debate on an area of the world where we have, for some years, had a focus. I was reflecting on the fact that, over the period  20072010 , EUR  100  million have been spent by the Commission in support and a similar amount will be spent in the future but nonetheless, an area where we have reflected again on the importance of sustainable and coordinated effort, as many Members have pointed out.  I think that Mrs Salafrancas comments at the beginning have been picked up and reflected again in a number of contributions about how we can make sure that our coordination is effective in terms of security, in terms of the political and economic coming together to address the concerns that this nation faces. Mrs Giannakou raised the question of dwindling water and dwindling oil; I think Yemen is the first country that is expected to run out of water by about  2015 , something which we have to see as a real and significant challenge.  In order to address this, we have to look at an integrated approach; a number of Members raised the question of what is the strategy which we should pursue. Let me try and outline a few of the key elements of that: first of all, the issues of security and counter terrorism. As we approach the London meeting, we need to collaborate effectively on this, a point raised by a number of Members: we need to get the package of assistance together and focus on the work that we are already undertaking, for example, in the Atalanta mission off the coast and the importance of that.  The issue of improving maritime surveillance is being looked at right now; it was the subject of a discussion I had recently with the Spanish Defence Minister to see what more can be done in order to coordinate better and more effectively to deal with maritime security, bearing in mind the length of coast and the amount of space that have to be covered.  I think, too, that we have described this comprehensive approach of how to link together the different elements and engage the neighbours of Yemen. Mrs Brantner, you raised particularly the Gulf Cooperation Council. I agree: a very significant part of how we try and address this area is to work collaboratively with the neighbours around the region and again the London meeting will, I hope, bring together the key Member States from around the area who can help us.  The London meeting is that opportunity, of course, to pull together our thinking and to do so with the United States and with others. We are engaging with the United States. It is not true to say that their approach is confined to counterterrorism: they also support and are fully on board with what we describe as our root causes approach, again the mixture of things which we need to do to ensure that we support this country.  To answer the specific point on security, the EU Home Affairs informal meeting is taking place in Spain this weekend. I understand the American counterpart will be there in order to have discussions on the points which Members have raised.  I agree with the comment that this is not a Christmas tree or wish list. We have to be very selective about what we believe we can do to make a difference; helping Yemen to have the type of dialogue it needs to have internally in order to support the people and to try and resolve some of the conflicts which occur in that country is going to be just as significant in my view as anything else we do.  Asked about finding the right kind of support, the stability instruments too, can be used appropriately, I think, to provide the level of support, but this is no substitute, and could never substitute, for trying to support the government to have the internal dialogue that only they can have. Partners have to engage in Yemen to be able to address the problems which are of greatest significance for that.  So for me, this has been a very useful debate, I am very grateful, because again it helps me in my mind to set the agenda of the issues that I will take to the Foreign Affairs Council as we debate this and then on to London engaging, as I have indicated, with the government on all the elements where we can provide continuing support to develop the country economically, to deal with counter terrorism, to deal with the issues of support from the neighbourhood, too.  I think a final point is to recognise the plight of the hostages which has been raised a number of times: six hostages, one British, five German including some very young children with the German family who have been taken hostage. I know that Minister Westerwelle, the German Foreign Minister, was recently in Yemen. He and I spoke about it this week, and our thoughts will always go to the hostages who are suffering at the present time. We will take all of these issues into the meeting in London and I am very grateful again to honourable Members for raising these important matters.
1510406 author: Roger Merx:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I appreciate very much the interest that you take in the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement. It is also with great interest that I read the report of the Development Committee, which provides a shrewd analysis on the matters at stake. Throughout the whole process, it is a priority for us to keep Parliament informed, as we have done over the last months.  The negotiations have gained momentum and are now entering into the final phase, and the next joint ambassadorial meeting will prove the value of these discussions. We will be heading for an extraordinary joint ministerial meeting to conclude the negotiations in March, as foreseen by the Cotonou Agreement.  Let me now share with you some observations on the report. Above all, the report has already proven helpful in upholding certain positions of the EU. Just to name some of them: your position on strengthening national ACP parliaments, on the International Criminal Court and on other human rights issues confirmed our negotiation position. Likewise, the importance that you attach to climate change and food security is shared by us and will be reflected in the final outcome.  I would like to focus on four items, starting with the importance of the parliamentary dimension as embodied in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to which the report attaches great importance. The Commission is committed to strengthening the parliamentary dimension in the Cotonou Agreement. Therefore, our intention is not to weaken the JPA. On the contrary, the Commission proposal must be seen in the broader context of growing parliamentary oversight functions, in particular, with a view to existing and future Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and EDF programmes. We should ensure maximum synergy between EPA and Cotonou institutions, including between regional JPA meetings and the EPA parliamentary bodies. In this emerging setting, a reduction in plenary JPA meetings would make sense. The Commission accepts, however, that this matter needs to be agreed with those who are most concerned, and is therefore open to reconsidering its position. At the same time, we would be interested to learn more from Parliament how it sees the JPAs role and functioning in a changing political and institutional environment.  The establishment of EPAs does not only call for the need to ensure synergy between them and the Cotonou institutions, but also requires an update of the Cotonou trade provisions, since the Cotonou trade regime has become obsolete. We have agreed with ACP partners that we will continue the negotiations towards regional European Partnership Agreements. In this context, as Development Commissioner, I would stress that it is neither politically desirable nor legally feasible to incorporate EU unilateral trade regimes such as GSP or GSP in Cotonou, as suggested in the draft report, since these depend on autonomous EU schemes. By contrast, the Commission welcomes the call for Cotonou to give more attention to the trade and development issues in general, and to aid for trade in particular.  In your report, you express the concern that the conclusion of EPAs and increased regionalisation might undermine the coherence of the ACP Group. The Commission believes that regional differentiation within the framework of Cotonou is more an opportunity than a threat. Regional integration is crucial for the development of ACP countries and we need to integrate this reality into Cotonou to better support their own efforts towards this objective. This by no means signifies disrupting the ACP Group, and our ACP partners largely share this approach.  Let me now briefly comment on sectoral policies which you are stressing in your report. We fully share the importance of climate change and renewable energies which are already included in the present revision exercise. Likewise, we will address food security in the regional dimension.  You also stress the importance of good governance in tax matters and in the fiscal area. Good governance is a fundamental principle of the Cotonou Agreement. Building on Article  9  of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission is currently preparing a new policy on good governance in tax matters in the context of development cooperation. We are also seeking to address these aspects in the ongoing revision exercise. Therefore, I can confirm that we share the same objective with you, which is to create fair, effective and growthenhancing tax systems and effective tax administrations, as well as to strengthen the participation of developing countries in international tax processes.  Finally, I take note that you deplore that the Commission has not consulted a wider variety of actors before launching the revision process  paragraphs  2  and  8   and I fully agree that, for the future of the ACPEU relations post 2020 , a comprehensive consultation process is needed, possibly in the form of a green paper. We will have to assess the results of the present revision exercise as a basis for this as a form of lessons learnt.
6587522 author: James Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  First of all, with respect to the GSP and GSP, we have nothing in principle against these being included in the Cotonou Agreement, but we should realise that GSP and GSP are unilateral and Cotonou is contractual. I think it is therefore very difficult to put them in the Cotonou Agreement, but maybe we can find formulas that make the link more intricate.  (FR) Democratic scrutiny: several speakers have requested that the practice of holding two annual plenary meetings be maintained. The Commission is prepared to reconsider its point of view in this respect, but perhaps we could nevertheless agree to let the regional meetings coincide, as far as possible, with one or two of the plenary meetings, since it seems to me that all the meetings of the European Parliament, together with those of the other institutions, create an awful lot of meetings. I therefore agree in principle with the idea of having two plenary meetings, but let us try to bring them closer to the regional meetings.  Several speakers also spoke of the nature of the Economic Partnership Agreements. This is the term we agreed on, but in fact we should really talk in terms of development partnership agreements, and I think that this would also make the discussion with the ACP countries easier. I think that this would be liable to make the debate a little more open. In any case, if the European Parliament should agree at some point to a new Commission, of which I am a member, I will do everything possible, within my remit, to make these agreements a success and to be present at the sessions of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.  There were some questions on fiscal matters. I think that I have already dealt with this point in my introduction, and I really believe that it is important that this becomes a crucial subject in our discussions with the ACP countries, but also among ourselves, since, let us be serious  and I know that the Spanish Presidency also has a keen interest in this subject  if we really want to do something, we also have to have the courage to intervene with our societies in these developing countries. The problem does not only arise there, the problem arises in particular, and I would even say above all, in the relationship between Europe and its own societies and industries in developing countries. This is a process that is under way and I understand that the Spanish Presidency will also take initiatives in this respect.  Migration.  With respect to Article  13 , both sides want to update migration. On Article  13 , the Commission has put forward a balanced and coherent proposal that builds on the three pillars of cooperation in the areas of migration and development, legal migration and illegal migration and readmission. The aspects put forward by the report are duly taken into account. All areas deserve equal attention. Negotiations are ongoing, and we are optimistic about finding an agreement provided the balance between the three pillars is kept.  Mr Cashman made a remark with respect to discrimination. Mr Cashman is not here at the moment, but I think he is completely right. Sexual orientation was part of the elements proposed by the Commission and we attach a lot of importance to it, but you should also be aware, as the Commission is, that in some ACP countries, homosexuality is forbidden by law. We recently made representations to the Burundian President and also to the Ugandan President because they have introduced discriminatory laws, but this is a very touchy subject and I think, at a certain moment in time, you will have to come to grips with it. Either you insist that the text is very clear, and probably we will not get an agreement on it: that is the first possibility; or another possibility is perhaps that we have some language which is less specific. UN language is less specific but would also cover sexual orientation. That is something that should be further discussed in the course of the negotiations. I think I have reacted to most of the points, even if it meant that I have spoken for too long.
7848315 author: Michael Finlayson:  author.  Mr President, I frankly and fully acknowledge that these two oral questions tabled on  1  December last year have been overtaken by events, but this debate is still worthwhile to acknowledge that the issue of procedural rights is fully back on the table after a regrettable absence of several years and to stress the urgency and priority of this programme.  It has been a consistent complaint of the European Parliament for the last decade that procedural safeguards and defendants rights have not received the same attention, let alone action, as moves to enhance the speed and efficiency of investigations and of prosecutions. We have supported the latter because, then, more criminals get caught. Those who reject in principle the European Arrest Warrant are the apologists for mafia criminals and absconding robbers, rapists and terrorists. But it is question of balance and getting European Arrest Warrant plus, and thus justice all round, through procedural guarantees to accompany simplified crossborder prosecutions. Opponents of the European Arrest Warrant of course do not want any EU action on rights either; they just want European Arrest Warrant minus.  But the application of the European Arrest Warrant without proper procedural guarantees has, in some cases, led to the denial of justice, because mutual recognition has not been accompanied by a solid basis for mutual trust. One of those cases is my own constituent Andrew Symeou. Andrew has been in prison in Greece for six months awaiting trial on a manslaughter charge which seems to be based on mistaken identity and, I am afraid to say, police brutality to witnesses, and I believe the European Arrest Warrant has been misused. When it was agreed upon in  2002 , it was with the understanding from all sides that this measure, which would have the effect of EU citizens standing trial and being held in prison in another Member State, would be swiftly followed by measures guaranteeing their fair trial rights and guaranteeing there would be no miscarriages of justice. That promise was betrayed by Member States in failing to accept the Commissions  2004  proposal for a reasonably wide framework decision on procedural rights, and now a piecemeal approach is the best we can get. I am grateful that it was relaunched by the Swedish Presidency, but it is only a roadmap on a stepbystep basis.  We need to see the glass is half full and be optimistic, although I regret that the Council is, worryingly, only promising to consider, not to legislate on, Eurobail, which would have helped Andrew Symeou, who has been explicitly refused bail because he is a foreigner. Judges are currently asked to enforce the judgments and orders of courts in other Member States without examining the facts, and they will be subject to increasing criticism and public unease if there is no EUwide compliance with minimal procedural safeguards and defence rights for criminal investigations and prosecutions. It is not just individual citizens who fear poor guarantees of rights; this also deters judges, but also police and prosecutors, from working together, too.  I happen to believe that the human rights assurance in European Arrest Warrants should be an explicit condition of extradition, even if the Commission hates that. Thanks to Liberal Democrats, the UK legislation implementing the measure says that the court must be satisfied there is no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Puzzlingly, British courts seem shy of invoking this clause to block surrender. Now if all Member States genuinely observed their obligations under the ECHR, there might be no need for EU measures. The problem is not the absence of standards but the absence of practical respect, and many Member States find themselves before the Strasbourg Court for this reason. Considering that the Treaty on European Union and now the TFEU obliges EU States to respect the ECHR, this is shameful and unacceptable. So we do need an EU mechanism for enforcement which, from now on, will be provided by Commission infringement competence and European Court of Justice supervision. So EU measures need both to be consistent with the ECHR and not conflict with or undermine it and, at the same time, to add value in the sense of strengthening practical implementation.  I hope the Commission and Council agree that the standard of directives guaranteeing fundamental rights should be high. The Member State initiative on interpretation and translation, proposing the text which the Council agreed on last October, is less ambitious than the Commission text and needs improving. So we are concerned that the first measure does not demonstrate the highest standards. I hope we will be more ambitious and set a precedent for the next stages in building up procedural rights which, after interpretation and translation, are followed by other measures like legal advice, right to information, right to communicate with consular authorities and so on. Therefore, I want reassurance from the Council and Commission that measures in the roadmap will be rolled out fast enough to keep up the momentum towards a genuine achievement of fair trial rights, long overdue.
2416009 author: Katarina Smith:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I am glad to say my last word on Turkey.  I want to thank you for a very substantive and responsible debate this evening. Actually, I said my farewell concerning Turkey to you already in December or November. I will not repeat it now. I hope that I do not have to say any further farewells as regards Turkey in this Chamber and that we can move on and start tackling the major economic and other challenges of the European Union.  I also want to use this opportunity to thank the Spanish Presidency and Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero for launching the Alliance of Civilisations, which is a very important initiative, and I can say that I am a volunteer to join that alliance. It is very important also for EUTurkey relations.  Todays debate has focused largely on the party closure and rightly so. It is very important that Turkey reform its legislation and the whole constitutional legal framework of political parties in line with the recommendations of the Venice Commission.  Mr van Baalen and Mr Schmidt raised the issue of the Court of Auditors recent report on Turkey. I can say that our conclusion in the Commission, in DG Enlargement, concurs with the report and its conclusions concerning how to make our financial assistance more strategic, multiannual and more clearly linked to the needs stemming from the political reform agenda in our countries, in this case, in Turkey.  Work is now under way to this end, including a completely new orientation for preparing our planning documents on a multiannual basis and moving from project to sectorbased programming. This new approach also comprises a stronger emphasis on sectoral strategies being developed by the beneficiary countries themselves, which ultimately should ease joint identification of policy priorities between the Commission and the Turkish authorities.  I will be glad to provide you with a longer and deeper written response on this matter if you send me a letter shortly so that I can still do it during the term of the present Commission.  I think it is important, apart from party closures, to discuss the democratic transformation more broadly. That is what you have done this evening and I just want to make three points briefly, which, in my view, are the most important next steps.  We have seen tremendous democratic transformation in Turkey in the past five years. It is a very different country today compared to what it was, say, five years ago. But, of course, the glass is not yet full, and there are many important reforms that still need to be implemented in Turkey.  The first and foremost of them concerns citizens rights and fundamental freedoms. Turkeys record on freedom of expression is not in line with EU standards. Many authors and journalists are still facing prosecution and conviction for their work. It is now high time for Turkey to adopt the necessary legal reforms so that this problem will belong to Turkeys past and not to its future. That is fundamental for any open and democratic society and it is fundamental also to further discuss such sensitive issues as the Armenian issue, the Kurdish question or the Cyprus problem.  Secondly, the past year has seen important developments concerning civilmilitary relations. The ongoing Ergenekon investigation is crucial to the democratisation efforts in Turkey, and indeed, Turkish citizens deserve to see this investigation pursued to the end, and they rightfully expect all necessary precautions to be taken to ensure a fair trial for all defendants.  Thirdly, last but not least, genuine democracy cannot be achieved if half of the population  women  are grossly underrepresented in national and local politics. Turkish womens NGOs are relentless in their efforts to promote this agenda, as they should be, and we are their allies. The establishment of a specific Commission on Gender Equality is an important step which I hope will help greatly to enhance political representation of women at all levels in Turkish society.  To sum up, Turkeys EU accession process can be a long and sometimes winding road, but it is essential not to lose sight of the basic goal of the democratic transformation of the country. That is in the fundamental interests not only of Turkey but also of the European Union, and that is best achieved by being both fair and firm with Turkey at the same time, which maintains our credibility and the power of conditionality in driving reforms for fundamental freedoms in Turkey. In this major effort, I continue to count on your strong support. That is essential for this project to succeed in the end.
8607882 author: Roger Corless:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Madam President, the Commission is concerned about the substantial economic and fiscal challenges that Greece faces. The difficult situation in Greece is a matter of common concern for the euro area and for the EU as a whole, as large and persistent domestic external imbalances threaten the macrofinancial stability of the country with a serious risk of spillovers into other parts of the euro area.  The Greek authorities and the Greek people are aware of the challenge in front of them. On  15  January, the government presented an ambitious stability programme intended to tackle these issues. The programme envisages a deficit reduction from an estimated  12 . 7  in  2009  to below  3  in  2012 , starting with an adjustment of four points of GDP this year. This programme displays an appropriate degree of ambition given the sheer size of the consolidation needed and is a frontloaded programme. In more detail, the Greek authorities have announced a package of concrete measures for  2010 . Some of these measures have already been submitted to the Greek Parliament and are to be implemented shortly. Plans for the later years of the programme are less detailed at this stage.  Last week, on  3  February, the Commission adopted an integrated approach and surveillance mechanism which combines our assessment of the stability programme, a recommendation on the excessive deficit procedure to bring the budget deficit below  3  in  2012 , as the government established in the programme, and another recommendation using Article  121 ( 4 ) of the EU Treaty for the first time to ensure that Greeces economic policies are consistent with our broad economic policy guidelines and with the proper functioning of our Economic and Monetary Union. We have also started an infringement procedure to ensure that Greece addresses the problems that have prevented the reporting of reliable budgetary statistics until now and the Commission announced its immediate initiative on audit powers for Eurostat.  As regards the stability programme, the Commission fully supports Greece in its efforts to redress a difficult economic and fiscal situation. The measures and policy intentions outlined in this programme are an important step in the right direction. The successful large government bond issue on  25  January seems to indicate that market participants share this view, albeit at a high interest premium, and increases in the spreads thereafter also show that they remain cautious.  However, there are risks to the programme targets and the mediumterm fiscal adjustment. The macroeconomic scenario outlined in the programme is rather optimistic and there is some uncertainty about the underlying revenue projections, especially the estimated impact of efforts to tackle tax evasion during an economic downturn. Given recent market developments, interest and expenditure projections also seem to be on the low side. As far as the recommendation on the excessive deficit procedure is concerned, our recommendations as regard measures to be taken this year rely fully on the measures announced by the Greek authorities in their stability programme. They include measures to be implemented in the first quarter of this year, such as wage bill cuts, reduction in public employment, progress with health care and pension reforms, tax and excise duties increases and tax administration reform. Some of the fiscal consolidation measures have already been submitted to the Greek Parliament and should be implemented shortly. The Greek authorities are invited by the Commission in our proposal to the Council to present by midMarch a detailed implementation report announcing adopted measures and the calendar of the announced measures. An evaluation of the risks should also be carried out so that, in case risks materialise, compensatory measures should be put in place as necessary.  In this context, the Commission welcomes the announcement on  2  February of further measures, notably a nominal public sector wage freeze and an increase in excise duties on fuels to safeguard the budgetary target for this year, as well as the Greek authorities readiness to adopt and swiftly implement additional measures if needed.  As regards the later years of the programme, we call for further adjustments of a permanent nature, continued tax administration reforms and an improvement in the budgetary framework. Obviously, Greece is also requested to further pursue efforts to improve the collection and processing of general government aid. Given that plans are less detailed, we propose setting up a tight reporting system in which the Greek authorities will report on a quarterly basis on measures implemented, results achieved and measures to be implemented. This tight reporting system will ensure that the plans will materialise as planned. We also adopted the recommendation to put an end to the inconsistency with the broad guidelines of the economic policies and the risks of jeopardising the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, given the continuous loss of competitiveness of the Greek economy, and the widening of external imbalances as well as by the large spread in financial markets visvis benchmark bonds.  Moreover, comovements in spreads in other countries are also evidence of clear risks of spillovers to other Member States. In this context, Greece is expected to adopt a comprehensive structural reform programme aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the public administration, stepping up pension and health care reform, improving labourmarket functioning and the effectiveness of the wage bargaining system, enhancing product market functioning and the business environment and maintaining banking and financial sector stability.  What are the next steps in this very detailed process of surveillance? Our recommendations will be discussed by the Eurogroup and Ecofin next week, and then a first report should come in midMarch elaborating on the calendar for implementation to safeguard the  2010  targets. Then, on a quarterly basis, starting in May, Greece should report on the way in which they are responding to the Council decision and recommendation. Each report will be subject to a Commission assessment. It is clear that, if there are signs that risks are materialising, additional measures would need to be implemented. Therefore, it is crucial that the Greek Government stands ready to adopt additional measures if necessary, as they have already indicated.  In conclusion, we are living in an unprecedented situation but we are facing it. Greece has adopted an ambitious programme to correct its deficit and to reform its public administration and its economy. It deserves support in this difficult task, and the Commission supports Greece. The integrated surveillance mechanism, together with the willingness of the authorities to tackle the problems, is the guardian of a successful implementation of fiscal consolidation measures and structural reforms that will put Greece back on a sustainable path. Timely and rigorous implementation of the budgetary measures and of structural reforms  and both fiscal measures and structural reforms are contained in the programme adopted in Greece by the Greek authorities  together with the tight monitoring of the situation, is the key to finding an adequate solution to the present tensions in our markets.
6580608 author: Amy Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, the forthcoming  15 th Conference of the Parties indeed offers a unique window of opportunity to improve the conservation and status of a wide number of species affected by trade.  The European Union is one of the major markets for wildlife products. Therefore, it has a specific responsibility to ensure that wildlife trade is sustainable and that robust international rules are adopted within the CITES Convention to that effect.  It is a priority for the Commission to make sure that international trade is not detrimental to the survival of endangered plants and animal species. In this respect, the EU has been playing a leading role within CITES and will continue to do so at the next meeting. The Commission will, in the coming days, adopt a proposal for the EU position in view of this meeting. The common EU position will then be adopted by the Council.  In its discussions with the Member States, the Commission will make sure that the final common position supports ambitious and sciencebased measures. I would also like to thank Parliament for its position on the most salient issues which will be discussed at the CITES Conference of Parties. This resolution sends a clear message which we will need to take into consideration.  While the detailed position of the European Union has not been finalised yet, I can explain the principles and priorities which will guide our decisions on the most sensitive issues to be discussed in Doha.  In the first place, the European Union considers that CITES is an appropriate instrument to regulate trade in all species which are affected by trade. This is the case for terrestrial as well as for marine species and for species subject to important commercial interests or not.  In that vein, the European Union has tabled proposals to regulate trade in two shark species: porbeagle and spiny dogfish. It is of the utmost importance that sharks at last receive the protection they deserve after decades of overfishing.  A listing under CITES Appendix II would put an end to unregulated international trade in shark products which is one of the key drivers of their exploitation. With such listing, trade in those shark products will only take place if they stem from sustainable managed stocks.  The European Union is also proposing to arrange for the protection afforded by CITES to the tiger, which is one of the most endangered species in the world.  2010  is the international year for tigers and is a perfect opportunity to strengthen the current mechanisms in CITES to allow for a merciless fight against illegal trade in this species and improved transparency in range states on how the tiger populations are conserved.  I would also like to touch upon some of the other important proposals which Parliament has also clearly identified. The first is Atlantic bluefin tuna. I have to repeat here that there is no final position on this issue. What I can tell you is that there is concern within the Commission on the current state of the stock and that we are working hard to find an appropriate proposal that will help properly address this problem at the international level. The final Commission position will take account of the latest scientific information on the stock and of the outcome of the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna which took place in November last year.  The second is elephants and the ivory trade. This has been a longstanding, contentious issue within CITES, especially among African countries themselves. The Commission is very worried about the high level of poaching for elephants and illegal ivory trade which has been observed recently.  The protection afforded to elephants needs to be reinforced, and the Commission will not support solutions which would present a risk of increasing poaching. In that context, we believe that it would not be appropriate that the next Conference of Parties agrees on a resumption of the commercial ivory trade.  We also consider that proposals submitted to CITES with a view to downlisting some elephant populations from CITES Appendix I to Appendix II need to be assessed objectively on the basis of the rules agreed within CITES.  Allow me now to say a few words about the proposal by the USA related to the prohibition of the international trade in polar bears. We are all aware that the ice melting in the Arctic is a dramatic threat for the survival of this species. This needs to be addressed first and foremost via a very ambitious policy on climate change and I think that the EU has clearly shown the way to go in the matter. We also believe that it is worth checking how any additional threat to this species might be mitigated. International trade is limited but might exacerbate the pressure on the species. Our final position will depend on how the measure proposed by the United States provides real benefits for the conservation of a species.  Finally, on the question of corals, there is no doubt that red and pink corals have been overharvested in many regions of the world. At the last CITES meeting in  2007 , the European Union backed a proposal by the United States to regulate international trade in both species and we have again cosponsored a USA proposal for COP 15 . I believe that the European Union should be consistent in this support as the new information available does not show any improvement in the situation. I would also like to stress that such regulation would by no means result in the prohibition of trade but would just make sure that trade is possible when it is sustainable.
5548345 author: Frederic Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I am very grateful that I had such an early chance to participate in this exchange of views with you on the accession countries. I promised during my hearing that I would come to listen and to take your advice, and todays debate was a clear proof of the richness, wisdom and insight that are assembled here in this House.  Let me make two general observations. First, I take the promises I made during the hearings very seriously. I am interested not in having two monologues, but in having a dialogue with this House which would reflect the true spirit of the Lisbon Treaty.  Let me also make another general observation, and I referred to this a couple of times during my hearing. In talking to the candidate countries and the prospective candidate countries, I always underlined the following four principles. The first is strict commitment to the Copenhagen criteria; they are nonnegotiable. Secondly, a strict commitment to fundamental freedoms and rights, including religious and minority rights and, of course, womens rights. Thirdly, the process being honest and reflecting credibility on both sides and at all levels. Fourthly, I will never underestimate the issue of integration capacity.  On Croatia, both Parliaments resolution and the Commissions position underline that Croatia can count on Parliament and the Commission as reliable allies. If the country manages to deliver on all outstanding conditions, I remain confident that accession negotiations can be concluded this year. The Commission, and I trust the current and future presidencies as well as the European Parliament, will support Croatia in reaching its goal.  On the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, let me stress once again that the country earned a Commission recommendation to start accession negotiations on the basis of its own merits. Nonetheless, the country continues to face many pressing challenges, including the political criteria. As was pointed out during the debate, there is now a window of opportunity to resolve the name issue, and I am fully committed to supporting the ongoing talks.  On Turkey, we are all aware that we do not have an easy way ahead of us, either for Turkey or for the European Union, as was clearly stated by many during the debate. I know, however, that the Turkish Government is still committed to the democratic opening. Who would have imagined only five years ago Turkish society and politicians openly and intensively discussing the Kurdish issue, civilmilitary relations, the reopening of the Halki seminar or relations with Romania?  Nevertheless, I remain concerned about restrictions on press freedom and media pluralism. Further legal amendments are needed to protect journalists, human rights activists and politicians from prosecution and conviction for the expression of nonviolent opinion.  As regards the accession negotiations, the opening of the important environment chapter last December is an encouraging development, bringing the number of open chapters to  12 . I am hopeful that we will be able to open more chapters this year. However, Turkey will need to make additional efforts in order to be able to fulfil the demanding benchmarks. It is therefore important that the necessary preparations are being continued with rigour.  The Commission also welcomes the reinforced dialogue with Turkey on migration, which should lead to concrete achievements, in particular, as regards readmission and border controls. In response to a specific question from one of your colleagues, let me say that the Commission is aware of the recent developments concerning Turkish lifting of visa requirements for Lebanon and Syria. The Commissions DirectorGeneral responsible for these issues will be in Ankara next week for talks. This will be one of the issues he will discuss on that occasion and I will report on these discussions.  Let me also add, having been requested, the following position of the Commission. All measures that the Commission has proposed and undertaken have always been aimed at ending the isolation of the TurkishCypriot community as a means of facilitating the reunification of Cyprus in line with the Council conclusions of April  2004 . We are implementing the EUR  259  million aid package for the sustainable social and economic development of the TurkishCypriot community and its full participation in the European Union following a settlement and reunification. The Green Line Regulation is facilitating economic and personal contacts between TurkishCypriots and GreekCypriots. The Trade Regulation, on special conditions for trade for the TurkishCypriot community, remains with the Council for consideration.  Coming back to Turkey, the reform process is to continue and the European Union should continue to encourage the process and progress. The Commission remains committed to the accession process with Turkey. Our leverage and influence in Turkey will become all the more credible and stronger if our commitments remain unambiguous.  I am looking forward to a very fruitful and close cooperation over the next five years.  (Applause)
273295 author: Victor Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, let me start by thanking everyone for yesterday giving us and me your trust and confidence by voting yes for the new Commission.  It is an interesting first day at work and I am grateful to share with you the important issue of sharing information with the US for the purpose of combating terrorism, this time in relation to the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP).  The European Parliament has, of course, shown great interest in this matter. This is quite right, since the TFTP confronts us again with the challenge of reconciling data sharing with data protection and, if we take up this challenge, this helps us to give citizens security, privacy and data protection.  One of the aims of the interim agreement has been to ensure implementation of the conditions in the European Parliament resolution of September  2009 . We firmly intend to strengthen further the data protection part when negotiating the longterm agreement, particularly concerning the right to receive information about whether ones rights have been respected under the agreement, and stronger guarantees about effective redress, lawful data processing and the deletion of data.  The second Bruguire report was made available to MEPs on Monday last week, and it demonstrates the significance and the value of TFTP in the investigation and disruption of terrorism, including in the European Union. The report confirms that TFTP has been used to identify and arrest individuals who have subsequently been convicted of terrorism within our Member States. The report also highlights that TFTP is a valuable source of reliable information necessary in the fight against terrorism. There are specific examples and the Council referred to a few of them.  We know that the threat of terrorism in some of our Member States remains as high as ever, and I am sure that you can see that rejection of the interim agreement by this House would represent a serious blow to EU security.  Some of our Member States have made it very clear that they want the TFTP to continue because they have benefited from it in the past and will continue to do so. They have told us that the reliable information that the TFTP provides on known and suspected terrorism is an important source of legitimate intelligence needed to address the complex threat, notably from alQaeda inspired terrorism. The interim agreement is not only a favour to the US; it is in our common interest.  Much has been said about the level of protection of data in the interim agreement and this is, of course, a key concern. I encourage Members  and I am sure most of you have already done so  to look closely at the interim agreement. You will see that it contains significant and detailed legally binding commitments on the way that the US Treasury Department can process data under the agreement. They include, for example, a strict limitation on the purpose of processing, which is limited to the investigation, detection and prosecution of terrorism. It includes an absolute prohibition on data mining  searches of the database can only be undertaken where it is possible to show a reason to believe that the subject of the search is engaged in terrorism.  That means that the data held on the TFTP database are effectively anonymous. Only if there is a reason to believe that one identified person is a terrorist can the data of that person be seen and extracted from the database. This is important. The interim agreement obliges the Treasury Department to delete data within five years of receipt  a period which is in keeping with the retention period in EU legislation on terrorist financing. The agreement also provides for a detailed EU review in which some of our own data protection authorities will participate to ensure that these and many other data protection obligations are complied with.  The agreement does not involve the transfer of virtually all SWIFT data to the US Treasury Department. I can assure you that only a fraction of SWIFT data will be transferred under the interim agreement. It does not in any way affect the powers of data protection authorities with regard to processing activities performed in the EU by SWIFT or financial institutions.  Refusal of consent will bring to an end the interim agreement, including the significant data protection safeguard it contains. If the US is able to access data by other means  for example through bilateral relations with the Netherlands  those safeguards will no longer apply. If the interim agreement falls, it is likely to take considerable time before any alternative can be put in place. So refusal of consent risks leading to both a data protection gap and a security gap.  Finally, the interim agreement is only an interim agreement. It might not be the best agreement in the world. It can  and it will  be improved. The Commission is now finalising the draft mandate and the guidelines for the longterm agreement and we will adopt them swiftly.  I give a personal commitment to you to ensure that the European Parliaments concern will be addressed and that we shall seek a strong protection of privacy and data protection in the new agreement. The European Parliament will be fully informed at all stages of this procedure. I hope that this answers a few of your questions.
2224299 author: Frederic Corless:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, this is the Commissions new dual approach. As the former debate showed, now that we have the Lisbon Treaty, work at EU level now enters into a new phase. I am very happy and honoured that I will work together with you in the fight against terrorism and on other securityrelated matters. We will do this while, of course, fully respecting that it is the Member States who have the final responsibility for all operational and intelligence work in this field.  I would like to recall to you  some of you were at my hearing a few weeks ago  that I made a promise that I would do an evaluation of all counterterrorism policies. As a first step, I have asked my services to prepare an overview and an assessment of everything that has been achieved so far. This will be the basis upon which I will decide how to move forward. We need to evaluate and to get a full understanding of what we have, its effects, what is possibly missing and what is overlapping in order to be able to propose new measures and more thought through measures. I look forward to bringing this evaluation to you and to discussing it with you.  But this stocktaking does not mean that I am not fully aware of the fact that the threat of terrorism has not diminished. As my colleague, Mr Kallas, and the Council Presidency have said, we know that terrorism is still one of the greatest threats to our values and to our democracies. The Denver flight showed that recently.  We have statistics from Europol showing that in  2008 , EU Member States reported a total of  515  failed or successfully perpetrated terrorist attacks within Europe;  359  individuals were tried on terrorist charges in a total of  187  proceedings;  50  of these were related to alQaeda or Islamist terrorism, and  39  to separatist terrorism, such as ETA activities in Spain. We also know that in  2008 , we had the tragic events and the horrible bombing in Mumbai, which also targeted European citizens, among them Members of this House. These events and the figures from Europol speak a clear language: terrorism is still there, and it is important that we do not lower our guard and we ensure that all tools are deployed in the fight against terrorism, while of course always fully respecting fundamental rights.  If we look at the instruments that we do have today, we have the EU counterterrorism strategy, developed after the attacks in Madrid and in London. This strategy highlights the EUs commitment to combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights and to making Europe safer, allowing its citizens to live in an area of freedom, security and justice. This, of course, is a commitment that it still valid.  There can be no freedom without security and there can be no security without freedom. That is why respecting fundamental rights in the fight against terrorism is not only a requirement of any democratic society but is a necessity in order to ensure that our policies remain credible, legitimate and sustainable. That is why the Commission will only propose measures that will continue to be subject to EU law screening, especially with regard to fundamental rights and rigorous impact assessment, including the impact on personal data and individuals.  Terrorism is, as we know, a global phenomenon, and that is why we will remain dedicated to cooperating with our allies and partners and international organisations all over the world.  Regarding the internal dimension of countering and preventing terrorism, we do have in our counterterrorist strategy some key objectives on how the Union can contribute in the fight against terrorism. I fully share these objectives, in particular the need to stop violent radicalisation, protect our critical infrastructure, support victims, improve exchange of information between national authorities and cooperate with all appropriate stakeholders. We have to react to nonconventional threats and to improve the detection of threats. We have to deprive terrorists of financial resources and to invest more in research and technological development.  This development on these policies has, of course, been strongly supported by the European Commission in cooperation with the Member States. Over the past year, the Commission has made a major contribution to approximating the legal frameworks of Member States in this work. We have, for instance, the European arrest warrant, which created an EUwide common understanding on terrorist crime and facilitated extradition procedures within the EU Member States. We have also undertaken important activities to counter the terrorist abuse of the Internet, addressing conditions conducive to terrorist radicalisation, launching a European programme for the protection of critical infrastructure, and limiting access by terrorists to the means they need to commit their acts  funding and explosives.  The EU action plan for enhancing the security of explosives foresees important measures to raise the threshold for terrorists who want to use explosives for an attack. I would propose a legislative framework to address the dangers associated with precursors which can be used to fabricate improvised explosive devices. I will do so this year.  We also have the CBRN action plan proposed by the Commission last June and agreed by the Council. This Action Plan consists of  130  measures. The Commission has earmarked up to EUR  100  million which could be made available from its existing financial programmes to facilitate implementation.  I am fully committed to ensuring that, in the coming years, the European Commission will continue to develop its role as facilitator and catalyst for cooperation, expert networks, exchanging best practices, pooling resources, improving research and developing common approaches to transnational challenges. We will also have to revise how we use our financial resources. This might be by creating an internal security fund, which is foreseen in the Stockholm Programme.  On a large scale, international information exchange concerning the collection of data and storage of data concerning thousands of citizens has to take account  and this was very visible in the last debate we had  of very high data protection standards in order to prevent abuse and mishandling. We also have to make sure, as Commissioner Kallas said, that we connect the dots in an appropriate way. Together with my colleague, Viviane Reding, I will submit in the near future a combined data protection regime that would also cover police and judicial cooperation.  All this will be considered in the evaluation and it will be under the umbrella of the internal security strategy that we will put forward to you within a short time.  Finally, let me conclude by underlining that, in the long run, we can only succeed in fighting against terrorism if we remain able to communicate our values and remain respectful of fundamental rights. We have to avoid our policies being perceived as ambiguous or as applying double standards. We can only defend high moral ground and prevent alienation from our societies and our way of living if we remain faithful to our values of democracy and the rule of law.
9418678 author: Annette Corless:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, the High Representative and VicePresident of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, asked me to make the following remarks.  Allow me to thank you for this very timely invitation to address you on Ukraine, which is a key partner for the European Union.  As you will be aware, a second round of presidential elections took place on Sunday in Ukraine. This was an important event, not just for the country itself, but for the wider region as a whole. It is important because a democratic Ukraine will serve as an important example to its neighbours.  We welcome the positive assessment made by the OSCEODIHRled International Election Observation Mission that the elections were conducted in accordance with international standards and that there has been further progress in Ukraines already good electoral trackrecord since  2004 .  The statement issued by the High Representative on Monday expressed this sentiment. It also congratulated the people of Ukraine for their continued commitment to the democratic process. The high turnout on both election days was particularly encouraging.  It is clear that Ukraines democracy is continuing its process of consolidation. The population of the country goes to the polls, makes its choice freely, and expects to be heard. This is a significant achievement. Most importantly, it demonstrates Ukraines attachment to European values.  Elections have winners and losers. It is the electorate who decides. As we meet here today in Strasbourg, official election results have not yet been certified by the Central Election Commission.  Preliminary election results show a very small gap between the two contestants. We have already heard about possible challenges to the results in the courts. Some local court cases have already been initiated.  It is logical and legitimate that any possible problems are investigated. At the same time, it is of utmost importance that the electoral process as a whole continues in a smooth manner, demonstrating both the resilience and depth of Ukraines democratic maturity and the candidates own shared commitment to the countrys development.  Every election is a demonstration of popular will. It is also an opportunity for a new start. It is now vital for Ukraine to move forward. The success of the electoral process in Ukraine  given Ukraines geographical and strategic importance  matters to the EU, and to Europe as a whole.  In the past years, we have seen political instability, characterised by competition between the President and Prime Minister, exacerbated by a lack of clarity in the Constitution. Ukraine has consistently held good elections, and has a vibrant civil society and free media. Regrettably, however, the overall reform process  which is vital for Ukraine  has significantly slowed. Much more should have been done in the past years.  Preelection politics also got in the way of the implementation of the IMF standby arrangement, with Ukraine failing to meet required conditions. The weakness of Ukraines constitutional framework has also contributed to this.  I am convinced that I speak for all of us in saying that we look to the new leadership in Ukraine to give new impetus to its reform efforts. As a first priority, in order to address the effects of the global financial crisis and ensure future economic stability, Ukraine needs to get back on track with the IMF programme, without delay. This is also a precondition for the disbursement of possible EU macrofinancial assistance.  In the weeks and months to come, we will see a new administration being formed in Kiev. The EUs message to Ukraines leadership is consistent and clear: now is the time to act. We expect to see concrete steps forward. Reform is essential for Ukraines own longterm prosperity and security. It is in Ukraines own interest  not just to please the international community. This message was also already conveyed at the EUUkraine Summit of  4  December  2009 .  Action is needed at many levels. On the economic front, Ukraine needs to take urgent action to tackle corruption and to improve the business and investment climate. This includes efforts to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, to open up the economy and to ensure fair and transparent competition  for example, by the adoption of a public procurement law in line with international standards and the European Union acquis.  At the same time, essential sectoral reforms in areas such as energy  in particular the gas sector  transport and the environment need to be undertaken and implemented. We have also consistently encouraged Ukraine to revisit constitutional reform, to bring stability and put in place functioning ground rules for political life. A constitution needs to stand the test of time, and its reform should not be tied to shortterm political considerations. It is up to Ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt. However, it should ensure that an effective system of checks and balances is in place which avoids the political paralysis that Ukraine has experienced in the past. The help and advice of the Venice Commission will be important in ensuring that this is done in a manner corresponding to European standards, availing of the best experience available.  Over and above the first reform priorities, Ukraine needs to continue the extensive task of ensuring regulatory approximation with European Union standards. This is a prerequisite to ensure that Ukraine can enjoy the full benefits of the new and ambitious EUUkraine association agreement which we are currently negotiating with Ukraine  including a deep and comprehensive free trade area,  It is our task to encourage Ukraine on the way forward and to support Kievs own leadership in a process of farreaching reforms and modernisation. We have many tools to do so. Through the European neighbourhood policy, we have the means to support Ukraines own reform efforts. Already today, ongoing and planned technical and financial cooperation with Ukraine is in the region of EUR  435  million, without counting possible macrofinancial assistance. The Eastern Partnership has brought additional tools. The comprehensive institutionbuilding programme envisaged by the Eastern Partnership is a case in point, as it specifically targets institutions within the Ukrainian Government which need strengthening in order to deliver on reform.  More generally, in negotiations with Ukraine on a new ambitious EUUkraine association agreement, we have set out our goals clearly: political association and economic integration between the European Union and Ukraine. This is a very significant undertaking, including the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area involving extensive regulatory approximation to the European Union acquis.  But our offer to Ukraine is not a oneway street. The pace at which Ukraine and the EU come closer together in the future depends on the quality and depth of Ukraines own reform efforts. We look forward to working with Ukraines new leadership to achieve our common goals.  We have been in contact today through our cabinets with the High Representative and my colleague in the Commission, and let me summarise the three following messages: firstly, we both agreed that these elections testified the vibrancy of democracy in Ukraine; secondly, we are committed to deepening the relationship with Ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda; and, thirdly, we look forward to starting a constructive cooperation with the Presidentelect as soon as official results are announced.
2326659 author: Lynne McNabb:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, if I were to try to give a balanced answer to all the questions that have been put and to all the matters that have been raised, I would need, I think, at least half an hour. I have only two or three minutes if I understand rightly.  Having said this, let me start with a general remark. I really do not believe that protectionism is a solution. Whether you are a believer or not, looking back into history, it is thanks to international trade that our countries have become prosperous.  Secondly, Europe has a transformative economy, which means that we have to import to be able to export. The idea that we could export without importing is completely false and contradictory to the facts.  So I staunchly believe that we should have free trade agreements with major economic partners, that we should make a success of the Doha Round and that we should further liberalise international trade, but that does not mean that we should not take into account the fact that this international trade also has to be fair and that we are entitled to protect our interests. The Commission is certainly going to do so when necessary and we will use the TDI mechanisms we have to have an impact on what we consider to be unfair distortions of trade.  Some very specific questions have also been asked, by Mr Jadot, for example, on the meeting on  4  February at the WTO and what the result of this was. Well, the main message at that meeting was that the rules of the General Agreement on Trade in Services are not an obstacle to the right of countries to ensure effective financial regulation. The reason is that GATS has a very broad scope for financial prudential measures, so this financial regulation, be it at national or European level, is certainly not contradictory to the GATS rules.  That brings me to the origins of the crisis we are going through. Hopefully, the major part is behind us. I am firmly convinced that it has had a major impact on trade, but that the origin of this crisis lies with financial imbalances which resulted from completely wrong choices by financial institutions. The financial crisis did not originate in Europe; it came to Europe and to the rest of the world from the United States.  I can agree that the food crisis of a couple of years ago, which was still not completely resolved and digested, let us say, has added to big imbalances, especially for the developing countries. You can say a lot about developing countries, about good governance and so on, but you certainly cannot lay the blame on the developing countries for being at the origin of the financial crisis. That is obvious, and they are very severely hit by that crisis, so we should take that into due consideration.  There have also been some questions, the last time by Mr Caspary and one by Mr Jadot too, asking what are we going to do with the TEC and with the strategic initiative for China?  My personal opinion is that the only good response to the economic development of China  which we are not going to stop, by the way  the only good response is to become stronger ourselves. I think that is the only good response.  When you look at this in terms of trade deficit, it is true that the trade deficit with China has gone up considerably, but when you look at the global trade deficit with Asia, this did not go up that much. Also, within Asia, the other Asian countries are facing very fierce competition from China.  So what we should do is become stronger ourselves. I believe that achieving this transatlantic marketplace, for example, is one of the best answers we can give.  We have a recent report, produced at the request of Parliament, which shows that, if you were able to reduce by  50  the nontariff barriers between Europe and the United States, this would have an effect which would be much larger than the Doha Round. We should work on that, but, having said this, it is not easy at all.  Speaking of the Doha Round, I staunchly believe that we should try to close that round because it has a lot of important features, among them, that the existing tariffs cannot go up any more, that we would be able to close them down. Secondly, there is a strong developmental approach in the Doha Round, provided, of course, that we can keep it as it stands now, and that should be the goal of the European Commission.  There was also the question by David Martin on the Robin Hood tax. First of all, I must say that I like the name Robin Hood much better than Tobin. But apart from that, I fear the Robin Hood tax is facing the same problems as the Tobin tax, that you can only do it if it happens on a global scale. You should also bear in mind that doing this, even on a global scale, would imply a very costly implementing mechanism to put it into place. President Barroso said about the Tobin tax that we are ready to support it as long as everybody else does, and that, of course, is the sticking point in all this.  A last word on  Mr Higgins, amongst others, asked a question  speculation and what came about from that, and also with respect to Greece.  This is not a debate on Greece so I am not going to go into the details of it, but I think, sincerely speaking, that some fault also lies with Greece itself. What you cannot have in a global economy, and what you cannot have in the European Union either, is moral hazard. Being a Member State of the European Union also implies some obligations. So Member States who get into a difficult position  and certainly we are ready to support them and help them whenever possible  should also realise that they have to obey the rules and if they obey the rules, then probably they will not get into the difficult situation they are in now.
218030 author: Nancy Reid:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their oral question, which confirms the interest of the European Parliament in the EUSouth Korea free trade agreement.  As this will be the first major trade agreement to which the European Parliament will be asked to give its formal consent under the Lisbon Treaty, I very much welcome this opportunity to reply to the many aspects of the free trade agreement raised in the oral question. I might not be able to give detailed replies to all aspects of the question, but I am happy to address them in a possible followup question.  The EUSouth Korea agreement is not only the first FTA negotiated by the EU with a country in Asia; it is also the most ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement ever negotiated by the European Union. After more than two years of negotiations, the free trade agreement was initialled on  15  October last year.  Throughout the negotiating process, the Commission remained in close contact with Parliament. In this respect, the Commission welcomes the resolution on Korea voted by Parliament in December  2007 . Many of the issues raised in this resolution have been addressed in the free trade agreement.  The whole process was also accompanied by a constant dialogue with civil society and a comprehensive trade sustainable impact assessment. The FTA is currently being translated. By the end of March, the Commission envisages presenting to the Council the decisions to authorise the signature of the FTA as well as to conclude the FTA. The objective is to sign the agreement in April.  The Commission is currently completing its analysis as to whether the agreement also falls within the competence of Member States. In this case, the FTA would require the ratification of all Member States before formally entering into force. As this process may take some time, it may be necessary for the Commission to propose that the agreement be provisionally applied pending its entry into force. The provisional application is decided by the Council on a proposal by the Commission.  The Commission is sensitive to the desire of Parliament to be able to give its views on the FTA before it is provisionally applied. The Commission will continue to seek out the best means, together with the Council and Parliament, to ensure that this takes place in a manner that does not cause unnecessary delays. It is of great importance that we apply the agreement as soon as is feasible.  As regards the regulation on safeguards, the Commission intends to present its proposal for such a regulation to the Council and the European Parliament in the coming weeks, and hopes that it will be possible to adopt this legislation rapidly so as to ensure that its application takes place as close as possible to the application of the FTA.  The economic benefits of the FTA are mostly in the EUs favour. It will relieve EU exporters of industrial and agricultural goods from Korean tariffs, saving them EUR  1 . 6  billion in duties annually, half of these directly from the day of the entry into force of the agreement. Obviously, potential gains from these duty savings will be even higher, as trade between the EU and Korea is expected to expand over time.  According to one study, the FTA will create substantial new trade in goods and services of  19 . 1  billion for the EU compared to  12 . 8  billion for Korea. Existing studies have not identified any sectors that would be negatively affected by the FTA, but in case of serious injury or threat thereof, the Commission would not hesitate to activate the safeguard procedures built into the agreement. Let me also remind you that, in the event of such a necessity, we have the possibility of employing the support measures under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  With regard to intellectual property rights, the FTA contains ambitious commitments going beyond WTO rules. Besides, the Commission has been careful to ensure that no element in the FTA contradicts the EU acquis communautaire.  On the implications of the protocol on cultural cooperation, the FTA would set a framework for engaging in policy dialogue on cooperating and facilitating exchanges regarding cultural activities. It is, above all, a demonstration of the EUs commitment to actively promoting the  2005  UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expression.  On rules of origin, the negotiations with South Korea resulted in a number of changes which are consistent with the ongoing process of reform of such rules. These changes go in the direction of simplification, thus implementing a specific request by the European Parliament. At the same time, strict rules have been maintained for all sensitive sectors.  The Commission has paid particular attention to creating a new marketaccess opportunity in Korea for European fruit and vegetables. In order to encourage Korea to open up its market, European Union entry prices have been eliminated except in the case of the three most sensitive products: tomatoes, oranges and Korean citrus.  Obviously, the FTA also opens the EU market to Korean products. To protect our industry against import increases causing or threatening injury, the FTA contains an effective safeguard mechanism.  This safeguard clause can be invoked from the entry into force of the FTA. The Commission will monitor the EU market and Korean imports to assess the need to invoke the safeguard clause, and remains committed to making use of it if conditions are met.  The same applies to the special clause on duty drawback, which can be invoked based on publicly available trade statistics on imports into and exports from Korea.  I am aware of certain concerns expressed, notably by the EU car industry, about the duty drawback provisions in the FTA, but I have to emphasise that duty drawback is currently allowed and used by Koreans as well as by EU exporters. Thus, maintaining it in the FTA does not accrue any new benefit. The current economic impact of duty drawback is very small, about one eighth of the value of the Korean duty concessions.  In the case of cars, available studies show that, on average, the foreign content of Korean cars is between  10  and  15 . If foreign sourcing were to increase significantly, the special clause on duty drawback would provide for an effective remedy.  It cannot be ruled out that implementation of the FTA may give rise to different views and interpretation between the parties. To address such situations, the FTA contains an efficient and rapid dispute settlement mechanism. The Commission will monitor closely the implementation of commitments by Korea and will not hesitate to invoke dispute settlement procedures if warranted.  The FTA would also break new ground in promoting the protection of the environment and respect for labour rights, containing comprehensive commitments on a range of social and environmental standards. The scope of these commitments is broader than that of any comparable agreement. To ensure that these commitments are respected, the FTA establishes a strong framework for monitoring their implementation, involving civil society, business, trade unions and NGOs.  Finally, I would like to inform you that Korea and the EU have been discussing possible adjustments to the tariff dismantlement schedule. These adjustments would imply, inter alia, that products classified under three years and five years would be subject to four and sixyear tariff cuts respectively, so that duties would be eliminated one year later than originally scheduled.  While this implies a modest sacrifice in terms of our offensive interests, we thought that such an adjustment would be appropriate, taking into account the sensitivities of certain sectors. Korea has indicated its readiness to agree to those changes on the basis that the sensitivities of both sides are equally respected.
6092083 author: Marc Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, first of all, with respect to the procedure  because a lot of questions have been asked about that  obviously, this will be the first time that Parliament has had to give its consent on the agreement as such and also the first time that the safeguard clauses will have to be adopted by codecision. This has consequences, I think, for the relationship between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.  The safeguard clauses are a proposal. The Commission adopted its proposal yesterday and it will be presented to the Council and Parliament very soon. Obviously, then, it will be a codecision procedure, so I do not understand the many remarks in which you put questions and express doubts about safeguard clauses. There will only be safeguard clauses that get your agreement, because it is codecision: it is as simple as that. So you should not be so worried about it and about ratification by Parliament.  That implies, of course, that there will be a debate in your committee. I already said during the hearing that I am not going to make a proposal for an early, provisional application unless Parliament has itself pronounced on the agreement, whether as formal ratification by Parliament or by some other procedure that we can establish between the INTA Committee and the Commission. That remains open and can be discussed, but in any case, Parliament will have the opportunity to give its political judgment on the agreement before any proposals for early application are put forward.  Another question is whether this is a mixed agreement or an agreement which is only about Community competences. The Legal Service is still preparing an opinion on that, but we cannot rule out the possibility that in the end, we will have to consider this a mixed agreement, which implies that all the national parliaments will also have to ratify it, and which could also have  in reply to Niccol Rinaldis question  consequences for the voting procedure in Council.  So much for the procedure: you will have every opportunity to express yourselves, and we will scrupulously respect this  if we did not do so, I think we would get into trouble!  Member of the Commission.  (NL) I will now deal with the issue of Opel. I understand that it is not just in Belgium, but also in other Member States, that the Opel issue arises. What I do not understand, however, is when people say look, there is a direct link between the free trade agreement with South Korea and the fact that there are plans to make closures at Opel in Europe.  Opel announced back at the beginning of  2009  that it intended to cut capacity in Europe by  20 . It is true that this can be done in such a way that, ultimately, all the factories remain open, on condition, of course, that Opel also views it as possible, from a business point of view.  It is also the case, however, that the decision to actually produce the SUVs in South Korea came, at any event, after the agreement with Magna had been reached but before the conclusion of the negotiations over a free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea. The assertion made by both Mr Belet and Mrs Van Brempt thus does not fit in with the timeline. The agreement with South Korea was only concluded afterwards.  It is possible, in fact, to argue the opposite case, I would have thought, in other words, that some Member States only agreed to a free trade agreement with South Korea on condition that they knew what was going to happen with Opel. I think, in fact, that you have to go with this opposite case if you look at the correct timeline as it developed in practice.  Incidentally, I would like to add, for Mr Belets benefit, that there is a small mathematical error in the comparison he quoted, where he stated that South Korea exports  15  times as many cars to Europe as Europe exports to South Korea. This may be related to policies that I was recently involved in in Belgium. The present figures are that  37   000  cars are being exported to South Korea and approximately  440   000  imported from there.  What is more, your line of reasoning is also faulty, as you are presuming that the two markets are the same size. If you compare the two markets, you have to observe that the South Korean market, of course, is much smaller than the European one, and that means that you are comparing apples with oranges.  When it comes to market penetration, we actually send the same percentage from Europe to South Korea as comes the other way: approximately  3  to  4 . This is what really matters.  Something that I think is actually far more important in estimating the market situation is the fact that South Korean manufacturers have recently opened major factories in Europe, namely in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, which will be capable of producing around half a million cars between them on an annual basis, so the reality is perhaps that, in future, Korean cars produced in Europe will largely, in effect, be the cars that reach the market here. What you have there is a clear shift, and so what you actually see across the car market as a whole is that there is a displacement taking place towards the major markets where, in the end, cars can be bought and sold.  As a final thought about what is, in any event, a particularly regrettable situation at Opel  for which, in my view, a solution is ultimately on the way  I think that one must not overlook the fact that the manufacturers follow the customers, and not the other way around, and that that is one of the most important reasons for specific policy decisions in a shrinking European car market also faced with a number of car makers who have found themselves in a difficult financial situation.  I will, perhaps, make one last comment about the tension between bilateral and multilateral negotiations, an issue also raised by Mr Moreira. Negotiations based on the Doha Round have been taking place since  2001 , which is now nine years, and there is still no solution to the impasse. I am a great supporter of multilateralism, and I think that we do also need to bring a positive conclusion to Doha, specifically retaining the development elements that it contains. I believe this also because its multilateral framework also provides the greatest legal certainty for international trade. I do think, however, that while we await the conclusion of the Doha Round  which I hope will be in  2010  or at the latest in early  2011   we cannot sit on our hands in relation to the bilateral front.  What I think is very important is that, when it comes to bilateral arrangements, we only conclude agreements that go further than Doha, so as not to undermine what is decided in the Doha Round, insofar as we are setting higher criteria. That, too, explains the drawing up of the free trade agreement with South Korea. It is not, in my opinion, of such a nature that it undermines multilateralism. If we were to undercut the multilateral track, then that would indeed be the effect, but that is not the intention, nor will it be in the forthcoming negotiations.
1981339 author: Jennifer Bauer:  author.  Mr President, this is an important piece of health and safety legislation. Liz has outlined some of the background to it. It has been a long time in the making  six years from the first meetings we had, as she has mentioned. It is good to see Commissioner Andor here this morning, but it is a pity, in a way, that Commissioner pidla is not here. We have often criticised him here in this Chamber, but we could have congratulated him this morning for eventually taking the initiative to bring forward this proposal on needlestick injuries, sharps injuries.  We took a while to persuade him to act. His services, in fact, were the people who kept advising that he should not act, that the directive agreed in  2000  on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to biological agents, combined with the risk assessment elements of the  1989  framework directive, were enough to prevent these sorts of injuries, but eventually we persuaded those services that, with one million injuries per year, clearly something was wrong. We needed specific legislation to address this problem, as they have in the United States and in parts of Spain, and it works there very effectively.  Eventually the Commissioner agreed to act and in  2008 , as Liz has said, did draft an amendment to the  2000  directive, but then HOSPEEM and EPSU, the public service unions, signalled their desire to formulate an agreement. They formulated that agreement. I am glad that they have. It is a good agreement, but it is a little ambiguous in certain parts. This is why I have tabled an amendment which has been agreed in the Employment Committee, to seek the publication by the Commission of guidance to accompany the directive to ensure the smooth and uniform transposition of this directive into law in all Member States.  We fully support the Commissions proposal for a directive, and we understand that the agreement from the social partners cannot be touched. We cannot amend it. Council cannot amend it. It is their agreement. However, the most important part of the agreement, clause  6 , which covers elimination, prevention and protection, unfortunately includes some ambiguity regarding risk assessment and precisely which preventative elements need to be implemented by employers and when.  If this ambiguity is not clarified, then we risk seeing dramatic variability in the application of the directive. It is for this reason that we are requesting that the Commission produce implementation guidelines to aid employers understanding of the risks and necessary preventative measures to ensure a consistent application of the directive.  Needlestick injuries are the most common and most dangerous form of medical sharp injuries. Whenever a hollowbore needle is used on a patient there is a risk of a needlestick injury that could lead to a serious infection of a healthcare worker because the hollowbore acts as a reservoir for the patients blood or other body fluids.  There is a huge body of independent evidence that has proven that the introduction of improved training, safer working practices and the use of medical devices incorporating safetyengineered protection mechanisms will prevent the majority of needlestick injuries. All of these things are necessary, not just one or two  all of those things are necessary.  Studies have also demonstrated that failure to implement any one of these three elements results in a significantly reduced impact. Similarly, attempts to implement safetyengineered medical devices only in certain areas or on certain patients would be neither practical nor effective.  In those countries where there is existing effective legislation such as America, Canada and parts of Spain, it is clearly mandated that all three of these elements must be implemented to prevent needlestick injuries. It is no coincidence that all are the same in this respect. So that is the ambiguity in clause  6  that we are seeking to overcome through the publication of guidance.  Liz has mentioned the trauma that people affected by needlestick injuries face. I have met people during the six years that we have worked on this subject who have suffered needlestick injuries, and I would really emphasise that trauma. I met a doctor who gave up medical practice because of a needlestick injury. I met a person who has HIV as a result of a needlestick injury. I have met people who turned out not to be infected, but only after months of uncertainty as to whether they were infected or not. I have also met garbage collectors and prison officers who have suffered needlestick injuries. They are not covered by this agreement. That is another area that we need to think about for the future.  Nevertheless it is a good agreement, and I think if we have good guidance to accompany it to ensure uniform application across the European Union, we will all have done a good job and hopefully we will radically reduce that figure of one million needlestick injuries per year.
6895464 author: Nancy LaCourt:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, let me first of all congratulate President Van Rompuy on what was a very good informal European Council for the first time under his chairmanship.  After reaching agreement among all of us on an important statement on Greece, we discussed the Europe  2020  strategy  a strategy for sustainable growth and employment. I had the opportunity to focus on the substantive policy issues we are facing, on the challenges, and on the lines which the Commission will formally propose next Wednesday.  Before the crisis, the European economy was making progress: we saw  18  million new jobs and a more dynamic business environment. However, these gains have been wiped out by the financial crisis and its impact on many of our areas of activity: a  4  fall in GDP in a single year, unemployment shooting up to  10 , a huge hit to our prosperity, a real threat to our societies. At the same time, the task is getting tougher: we have an ageing population, a growing productivity gap with our competitors, and failings in education and research. However, we also have many strengths: we have the worlds biggest market economy; we have the single market; we have the euro area. All this has proved to be an important asset in the crisis.  But today, Europe faces a very important choice; I would say a defining choice for future generations. Hoping for a return of the good old days is no option. One option is limited change  the lowest common denominator which brings some reform and some growth. But we could never get back what we lost in the crisis. This option would result in a Europe which is second class in the new global order. Minimal changes, some kind of adaptations.  I believe we can and must be more ambitious. We can aspire to an economic strategy that puts Europe on the path to competitiveness and that can create millions of new jobs. But this cannot be done by half measures and incremental change. We need to instil a sense of urgency, a recognition that business as usual will not protect our European way of life and will not defend our social models. On the contrary. Those social models will be put at risk if we do not adapt to a much more challenging global environment.  This requires a joint effort. We need the Member States; we need the European institutions; we need stakeholders and society at large; and we need specifically the active involvement and support of this Parliament, the European Parliament, for shaping this strategy and for communicating it to the people.  Next week, the Commission will set out the key elements of the strategy that it will formally propose to the European institutions. It will centre on three priorities: smart growth, inclusive growth, sustainable growth.  First, the core driver of growth must be knowledge; knowledge and innovation that produces tomorrows ideas, tomorrows skills, tomorrows technologies. Second, to keep in force our European model of society, we need to deliver more jobs. Our goal must be healthy, prosperous, secure societies, where everyone feels they can play their part. That means giving people jobs and skills and it means tackling the scourge of poverty head on. The problem of poverty is not only a national problem; it is a problem for which we need a common European response.  Our social market economy must be hardwired to seize the opportunities of the future. I am talking about sustainable growth, recognising the importance of tackling climate change, recognising the pressure on resources. With this, I mean a competitive economy, deepening the internal market, creating better conditions for investment  especially for SMEs  a European economy able to hold its own in a globalised market place.  These priorities are not unfamiliar. But the fact that we have not yet succeeded in realising these goals makes them more important, not less. Where we need to make a radical change is not in our prescription of what the European economy needs, but in our approach on how to make it happen.  What do we need in order to succeed? Firstly, the strategy must be comprehensive. We cannot have a pickandmix strategy allowing everyone to do the easy parts, the feelgood things, and leave the real challenges to the others. There are still many issues: when I think about completing the single market, about the quality of our taxation systems, about the way we spend money at a time of intense pressure on public finances, to name but a few.  Secondly, our strategy must engage all parts of our societies. We will not succeed in putting European society on the right track for the future if this comes at the cost of social conflict. That is why a proactive approach to creating jobs and addressing the scourge of poverty are essential. It is also why we have been wise to reform financial markets. We want a strong financial sector able to finance innovation and help businesses to grow: one which acknowledges its broader responsibilities to society and governments which came to its aid at the time of need; one which accepts that effective supervision at European level is necessary today.  Thirdly, we must not confuse having an overall vision for the European economy with the question of who does what?. It should not be a question of a debate on competences. What we have to see is the added value of a European approach. It is quite evident at a time of globalisation, when we need to discuss with America, with China, with Russia, with others, that there is added value in a common approach; for instance, in the G 20 , an initiative that was in fact launched by the European Union during the French Presidency by the President of France and myself, when we proposed to the American President to accept those summits. It is indeed necessary to recognise that we have greater influence if we act together. It makes no sense to recognise global interdependence and to reject European interdependence. That is why we need to act together.  Still, a lot of action will have to come at national level. Of course, there are national responsibilities which we expect to be addressed mainly by governments, but we also expect governments to commit sincerely to a European approach. The European approach is necessary, not to bring back powers in Brussels  this is not our intention at all  but to help the indispensable reforms in our societies so that they can bring more prosperity, more wellbeing to our citizens.  We will only succeed if we are ready to work together, not against each other, and therefore we need credible ownership at all levels. We need strong and true coordination in the economic field. The Lisbon Treaty gives us these instruments and we will use them.  In this European Council, I saw awareness of this problem. I can compare the discussions this time with the discussions five years ago when we were discussing the Lisbon Strategy. Let me tell you very frankly and very openly that I saw among Heads of State or Government much more awareness of the need to act together and also of the external constraints on the European economy. I sincerely hope that this time, narrow national interests will not again resist the need for closer coordination and an effective system of European governance.  We also need significant European Union level flagship measures to typify what we are trying to achieve: some concrete plans. We are going to present some of them: projects like an Innovation Plan, a new skills programme, a proper industrial policy, a digital agenda, green technologies, and a specific plan or action against poverty; projects that have a value, an impact in themselves; projects that show why Europe provides part of the solution and which show that the European Union is not just talking, it is acting.  Let me finish by calling upon you, the European Parliament, to show your strong support for these projects as legislator, as budgetary authority and as champion of European action in every corner of the European Union.
8766072 author: Jennifer Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, as the rapporteur pointed out, the aim of this proposal is to facilitate movement within the Schengen area for thirdcountry nationals who are legally residing in one of the Member States on the basis of a longstay or D visa. According to the current Schengen acquis, thirdcountry nationals who hold a residence permit can travel freely within the Schengen Area because the residence permit is equivalent to a visa.  However, there has been a recent trend in Member States not to convert longstay visas into residence permits upon arrival. That is why we are having this discussion here today; obviously, the Commission, the Council and the Parliament had to find a solution to the problem. The legal and practical situation has considerable negative consequences for thirdcountry nationals legally staying in our Member States on the basis of a D visa. These persons can neither legally travel to another country nor can they transit through the territory of another country when they want to return to their country of origin. The absurdity of this situation was illustrated by the example that the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, raised.  The best solution would, of course, be that all Member States issue the necessary residence permits and that they do this in time. Unfortunately, this is not the situation today, and therefore we have the present proposal which aims at extending the principle of equivalence between a residence permit and shortstay visas to longstay D visas. A thirdcountry national holding a longstay D visa issued by a Member State will thereby be able to travel to the other Member States for three months in any half year under the same conditions as the holder of a residence permit. This would restore the basic philosophy underlying the creation of an area without internal borders, namely that the person can travel around in the Schengen area for short stays with the documents based on which he or she is legally present in a Member State.  I was very pleased to learn that Mr Carlos Coelho had expressed his support for this proposal from the very beginning and the rapporteur, together with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, has understood that action needs to be taken in order to facilitate the life of thirdcountry nationals, because we want to encourage people legally residing in our area. I want to thank the rapporteur for his constructive approach to this.  I do not need to remind you that we have to find a solution quickly, especially due to the Visa Code which will be applicable from  5  April this year and will abolish the socalled DC visas which were intended to partly remedy the situation of D visa holders. I believe that the final text on the draft regulation satisfied all the parties since the compromise text was agreed between all the institutions. In order to tackle some of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament and the Member States  for instance, concerning security  several amendments have been made to the initial text.  To give a few examples, the proposal shortens the period of validity for longstay visas. They should have a period of validity of no more than one year. After this one year period, the proposal established the obligation for Member States to issue a residence permit.  The requirement of systematic checks in the Schengen Information System (SIS) is also reinforced. Where a Member State considers issuing a residence permit or a D visa, the responsible authority should systematically carry out a search in the Schengen Information System in order to avoid a situation where we have an alert at the same time as a longstay visa.  In order to give a response to the security concerns regarding biometrics  and this is, of course, a major issue for many Member States  a political declaration has, as you know, been attached to the draft regulation in which the Commission is invited to study the possibility of the use of biometric identifiers with respect to longstay visas and to present the results in the study to this plenary and the Council by  21  July  2011 . The Commission also accepts that a reporting obligation has been included in the draft regulation on the application.  To conclude, in order to find a compromise response to the major concern of the European Parliament concerning the guarantee for highlevel data protection in cases where an alert has been issued in the SIS, a joint declaration has been agreed. The Commission is invited by the Council and the European Parliament to present the necessary legislative proposals amending the relevant data protection provision for the Schengen Convention if there are further substantial delays in implementing the SIS II that go beyond  2012 . I believe that, with these changes, we have reached a reasonable, wellbalanced solution that will considerably facilitate the lives of the thirdcountry nationals that are residing legally in our countries. It will also very much correspond to the philosophy of a Europe without internal borders.  I want to thank once again the LIBE Committee, the JURI Committee and the rapporteur for their very constructive approach to this.
8461382 author: Katarina Bush:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Swoboda and his colleagues for tabling this oral question on the European Roma Summit. It allows the Commission to express its commitment to ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, on the one hand, and full social and economic integration into our societies on the other. We have just heard the Council making a real plea about the way the Member States have to go ahead by putting this in the mainstream of their policies.  As you know, this debate is taking place just some weeks before the second Roma Summit, which will be hosted in Crdoba by the Spanish Presidency on  8  and  9  April. The Commission welcomes and actively supports this initiative. I think this initiative will be a welcome moment to take stock of developments at national, European and international level since  2008 . It will then help us to contribute to a common perspective for the future.  Two years ago, the first summit was held. How far have we got? You can see a glass as being half full or half empty. Of course, there have been significant improvements but there are also significant gaps. Your question rightly highlights the central role of the European Unions instruments and policies and the importance of strengthening cooperation between all the key actors  Member States, institutions at European level, international organisations and civil society.  The Commission is committed to enforcing a directive which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic origin, and Roma discrimination is fully covered by this directive. We now have legislation at European level and the framework decision on racism and xenophobia, which will be a key tool to tackle the racism that Roma people suffer from.  By November of this year, all Member States should put into place criminal penalties for racist and xenophobic crimes, as laid down in the framework decision. As I have already announced, I am committed to monitoring the implementation of this framework decision as closely as possible.  The Commission is fully aware that this is not enough and that strong legislation needs to be complemented by information and awareness raising about rights and obligations. To this end, the Commission is addressing Roma issues in the context of the EU campaign For Diversity. Against Discrimination and in specific training for legal practitioners.  Quite rightly, the structural funds, the rural development funds and the instruments for preaccession were underlined as being important levers for change because they allow Member States to implement ambitious programmes which are targeted to the Roma. It is evident that these programmes must be very down to earth and pragmatic, based on evidence, and must approach the living conditions of the Roma in all their complexity.  This is not an issue that can be solved by a simple slogan. It needs a lot of concrete work. That is why the Commission is encouraging Member States to use the full potential of these funds to support Roma inclusion. To this end, we have launched a series of highlevel bilateral visits to Member States with significant Roma populations. They should lead the concrete commitments with agreed targets. The first event took place in October  2009  in Hungary with the full cooperation of the government. Others will be organised in the future.  Another concrete example of the Commissions commitment to using the Structural Funds for tackling Roma exclusion is the amendment that has been proposed to Article  7 ( 2 ) of the Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund. A very large majority in this House voted for the report by your colleague, Mr van Nistelrooij, at the beginning of last month: a measure which opens new policy and funding opportunities for housing for the benefit of marginalised communities where we can target the Roma specifically, although not exclusively.  Finally, thanks to the European Parliament, there are the pilot projects on Roma inclusion, with a budget of EUR  5  million over two years. This pilot project addresses early childhood education, selfemployment through micro credits and public awareness. The evaluation of this pilot project will be carried out jointly by the UNDP and the World Bank. I am very much looking forward to this evaluation because the evaluation will bring us the information about what we have done well and where the deficiencies are so that we can build on this in order to go ahead with a very targeted action afterwards.  The European platform for Roma inclusion was launched as a joint initiative of the Commission and the Czech Presidency in April  2009 . Its objective is to bring together relevant actors at European, national and international level, as well as actors from civil society, and make existing policies altogether much more coherent. This platform has led to the elaboration of the common basic principles for Roma inclusion, which is annexed to the Council conclusions on Roma inclusion adopted in June of last year. These conclusions call upon the Commission to take the  10  common basic principles for Roma inclusion into account when designing and implementing policies. Further meetings of the platform are expected to take place under the Spanish Presidency and the Belgian Presidency so it is not a oneoff action but it is followed up. I very much welcome the strong commitment of the Trio of Presidencies on this objective because we need to play into each others hands so that progress can be made. The Commission will continue to contribute to the Trios actions through its policies and instruments, in close partnership, of course, with Member States and civil society.  Ahead of the Roma Summit, I would like to inform this House that my colleague, Commissioner Andor, and I will publish a communication on the social inclusion of the Roma people, looking at the challenges ahead and outlining the EUs contribution to meeting this challenge. This communication will then be the basis of the discussion in Crdoba.
3965675 author: Sebastian Reid:  VicePresident of the Commission.  The train accident in Buizingen on Monday,  15  February was a shocking tragedy and, in the aftermath of this serious accident, several technical and political questions concerning rail safety can be asked.  The causes of the accident are not yet fully known and the technical investigation has been launched in accordance with the provisions of the EU Safety Directive. The Belgian investigation body has the responsibility for carrying this out. Two investigators from the European Railway Agency joined the Belgian team in charge of the investigation just a few hours after the accident had occurred.  I would like to stress that, as long as the causes of the accident have not been clarified, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions.  As is all too often the case when rail accidents happen, remarks alleging a link between European rules or regulations and the accidents have been made. I would first like to be very clear on the opening up of the market. Alongside the opening up of the rail freight sector to competition and the establishment of requirements to separate the activities of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, a stringent regulatory framework was introduced covering rail safety and interoperability. We have carefully monitored this opening up of the rail sector to competition to ensure that it has no negative impact on rail safety, and the indicators clearly show no such impact.  I also see no relationship between the accident and the reasoned opinion we sent to Belgium in  2008  regarding the lack of independence between infrastructure managers and rail undertakings.  Any proposition linking rail safety levels to rail market opening is, in my view, just an excuse to steer the debate away from the true causes of the accident.  The question of the coexistence of national and European train control systems can be put in these terms. More than  20  different national systems are used in Europe today to ensure the safe movement of trains. The incompatibility of the different national systems poses a major problem for international trains because either locomotives have to be changed at each border or they have to be equipped with several onboard systems.  For this reason, a single system for use at European level has been designed and developed and is currently being installed on major international lines and trains in Europe. The system is known as ERTMS, the European Rail Traffic Management System.  As regards the timing, most of the national systems were developed in the early  1980 s, but their deployment is a long and costly process. In most of the countries where these systems exist, only part of the national networks and locomotives have been equipped to date, and this partial installation of the equipment took approximately  20  years.  ERTMS specifications have been available since  2000 . A number of pilot projects were carried out between  2000  and  2005 . Since  2005 , several ERTMS equipped lines have been put into service.  At present,  10  Member States have lines with ERTMS and there are projects ongoing in almost all Member States. In Belgium, for example, the line between Aachen and Lige is equipped and intercity trains running on this line are equipped.  The ERTMS will, therefore, probably coexist with national systems for a period of  20  years. Some Member States will benefit earlier than others from the European system. We see, for example, that the Italian and Spanish highspeed network is already almost fully equipped, that the conventional network of Luxembourg is also almost fully equipped, while in  15  Member States, there are only pilot lines or projects.  It should also be noted that automatic train protection systems are just one element contributing to the safety of the network. Appropriate training, sound maintenance and better protection of level crossings are other important components for safety.  If we take a broader range of safety indicators, overall data show that railway safety standards in Europe are generally very high.
5638771 author: Roger Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I understand Members concerns about the ACTA negotiations.  Let me first recall that we are negotiating this agreement in order to improve the protection of made in Europe innovation in all areas where intellectual property rights can be breached. If we want to remain a competitive economy, we will have to rely on innovation, creativity and brand exclusivity. That is one of our main competitive advantages on the world market. So we need the tools to ensure that this competitive advantage is adequately protected in our main export markets.  We have tried to raise this issue for several years in multilateral organisations like the WTO or the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Those attempts have been systematically blocked by other countries. So, despite our preference for a truly global solution, we have had no other choice but to engage with a coalition of the willing.  The final agreement will only be binding on those countries that have signed, although we would of course be happy if more countries, and especially emerging economies, could subsequently join.  As I said during my hearing, those international negotiations are confidential. That is not unusual. Negotiations are about seeking an agreed outcome and require a minimum confidentiality in order for each party to feel comfortable to make concessions andor to try out options before finally settling on an agreement.  On the other hand, I agree that Parliament needs to be adequately informed about the evolution of the negotiations. We are doing our utmost in two areas: to inform Parliament, and to convince our negotiating partners to agree to more transparency. Firstly, as regards information to Parliament, we have provided you with the negotiating guidelines, full reports on the negotiating rounds and, in general, all the relevant documents originating from DG Trade that have been shared with the Member States through the Trade Policy Committee. We have done this in accordance with the framework agreement. Also, ACTA has been discussed several times in the Committee on International Trade in the last three years.  Let me add to this that the Commission organised two stakeholder conferences on ACTA in June  2008  and April  2009 , which were open to all citizens, industry, NGOs and the media. Another public conference will be organised on  22  March in Brussels.  I understand that you may feel that this is not sufficient for you to have a clear picture on where we stand in these negotiations. I have instructed my services to provided dedicated briefings with interested MEPs on all aspects of the negotiations. They will be at your disposal for discussion before and after each further negotiating round.  Secondly, I realise that the best way for you to know what is going on in these negotiations would be to read the draft negotiating text. This would give you a very clear picture of where exactly we are in those negotiations. As you probably know, there is an agreement amongst ACTA parties that the negotiating text can only be made public if all parties agree. The Commission is in favour of releasing the negotiating documents as soon as possible. However, a few ACTA negotiating parties remain opposed to early release. I strongly disagree with their approach but I cannot unilaterally breach a confidentiality commitment. My credibility as a negotiator is at stake.  Nevertheless, I will see to it that, at the next negotiating round in April, the Commission vigorously pushes its negotiating partners to agree to releasing the text, and I will raise Parliaments concerns bilaterally with ACTA parties, like the US, whom I am scheduled to meet before then. It is in the interests of all that everyone has a clear idea of what exactly these negotiations are about and even more importantly, also of what they are not about.  Finally, as regards your concerns on the substance, I would like to recall the main principles that are driving the Commission in the negotiation of this agreement.  First, the objective is to address largescale infringements of intellectual property rights which have a significant commercial impact. It will not lead to the limitation of civil liberties or harassment of consumers.  Secondly, ACTA is only about enforcement of intellectual property rights. It will not include provisions modifying substantive intellectual property law such as the creation of new rights, the scope of protection or duration. However, it should set minimum rules on how innovators can enforce their rights in courts, at the borders or over the Internet. For example, a European fashion designer, when confronted with counterfeiting of his creations outside Europe, can ensure that his rights are adequately safeguarded abroad.  Thirdly, ACTA must, and will, remain in line with the acquis communautaire, including the current level of harmonisation of IPR enforcement, the eCommerce Directive, the telecoms regulatory framework and, last but not least, the applicable EU legislation on data protection and piracy. There will be no harmonisation or changes to EU legislation through the back door.  In this sense, ACTA will have no impact on European citizens, since it will not create new obligations for the EU and no need for implementing legislation. However, it will provide our innovators increased protection in overseas markets.  I am aware of the concerns expressed by some of you about the introduction of a compulsory three strike rule or graduated response to fight copyright infringements and Internet piracy. Let me be very clear on this so there is no room for ambiguity. The three strike rule or graduated response systems are not compulsory in Europe. Different EU countries have different approaches and we want to keep that flexibility while fully respecting fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties. The EU does not support, and will not accept, ACTA creating an obligation to disconnect people from the Internet because of illegal downloads.  Similarly, we will make sure that ACTA does not hamper access to generic medicines. I know there has been some controversy on the impact of EU customs legislation on trade in generic medicines. As I have already told you at my hearing, that problem will be addressed in the upcoming revision of our customs legislation.  Finally, you also asked about an impact assessment on ACTA. In fact, considering that the Commission will not go beyond the acquis communautaire, we took as our basis the studies made for the  2004  directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights and for the  2005  Proposal for a directive on criminal enforcement of IPR (which was not adopted).  We also considered the conclusions of the  2008  OECD study on the economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy. That study values the economy of physical internationally traded counterfeits at USD  250  billion, which is to say, more than the individual GDP of  150  countries. It also contains an exhaustive analysis of the piracy of digital contents.  In short, I hear your concerns and will defend them to the best of my ability. Your confidence and support will help me carry this important task forward.
6587653 author: James Merx:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I must say that, listening to the speeches after I took the floor, it comes to my mind that a lot of you were not listening properly to what I was saying, because I made it very clear that we were going to respect the acquis communautaire, that I would try to make sure the other parties to the agreement give their OK to the disclosure of the text that is currently being negotiated; I made it clear that it would only apply to the commercial infringement of intellectual property rights, and I could continue for some time like this. So I am not going to respond again to all these questions that have been put because, honestly, I think I already answered them in my first speech.  David Martin put the question, what happens when somebody is, in fact, leaving not only the European Union but leaving a country that is a party to the ACTA Agreement? That is an interesting question because it depends, of course, on where he is going to. If he is going to a country that is not a party to the ACTA Agreement, then it will depend upon the customs and police of the country concerned, but that is beyond our reach. As far as it is within our reach, we will make sure that this is not happening but, of course, we cannot speak for others.  I do not quite agree with the whole of Ms in t Velds reasoning on parliamentary approval and parliamentary control, but let me just say very clearly what I think the case is in the Treaty of Lisbon. The case is that the Council gives a mandate to the Commission, and the Commission negotiates, and the Council has taken a decision on a mandate following their own rules of procedure. Whether or not a minister in the Council of Ministers needs the approval of his national parliament beforehand is not a matter of European law, but a matter of national law, and that differs from one country to another. I know that in your country, for example, for many positions of that kind, they need approval beforehand from the Parliament  OK, but there are other countries where this is not the case. We should not, I think, judge the way the Council takes a decision. Insofar as the Council respects the treaty and their own rules of procedure, I think that it is their business and not directly ours.  You were, to a certain extent, protecting me in that they should not check my iPod. I have no iPod, so there is no problem yet. In fact, I have had one since yesterday, but I have not yet used it and I am not going to New Zealand. It is a little bit too far. For that, you need officials who have a little bit more time to go there.  (NL) I shall leave the whole discussion on the kitchen for Mrs Stassen ...  Interesting question, what about China? Well, China is not, as you know, Ms Roithov, a party to the present negotiations. China is a serious problem because, as you rightly state, they are the number one source of counterfeiting.  Now we have several negotiations with them and discussions with them, also the highlevel economic dialogue. Repeatedly, we put emphasis on intellectual property rights, which is one of the main problems, not only within Internet trade but also in a lot of other activities. Once ACTA is concluded, it will be open to all countries to sign it, and I hope that China will come to the conclusion that, for their own industry too, it would be beneficial if there were better protection of intellectual property rights, and sooner or later, that will come. Look at other countries where this also happened in the past: now they have much more interest in intellectual property rights.  I do not quite agree on the interpretation by Mr Le Hyaric and Mrs Trautmann concerning Article  218 . What Article  218  says is that Parliament should be informed about all steps in the procedure; well, you are, and even more than that. What we do by way of information goes far beyond what is mentioned in Article  218 , far beyond, but I have no problem with that. I made it clear in my introductory statement that we will insist on other parties agreeing that we be in a position to disclose the present draft of the text, but it is not correct that we would not be respecting Article  218 .  By the way, let me say to Ms in t Veld, we sent you Annex  16  to the agreed statement by all ACTA participants about maintaining the confidentiality of documents. That was sent to you by the DirectorGeneral, Mr David OSullivan, on  21  January  2009 . Of course, that was in the previous Parliament, but it is still the same person. Mr OSullivan is the same and Ms in t Veld is the same, so you got it. So it is a little bit difficult then to question me as to what this is all about.  Finally, let me make it very clear that what I have been saying and what I said in the hearing should be taken seriously. I will do my utmost to have the agreement of the contracting parties that we can fully inform you. As long as that is not the case, I cannot disclose to you the drafts of the agreement because that would breach the confidentiality agreement and breaching such an agreement would have effects that are not limited to the ACTA negotiations but would spill over to a lot of other negotiations we have with these countries concerned. It would breach the confidentiality as such and that makes all negotiations very difficult, if not impossible, but I will do my best to see that you get the stuff.
3872908 author: Roger Cameron:  VicePresident of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  Mr President, if I might just give some comments directly on the issues and questions that have been raised.  To Mr Kasoulides, on the Nonproliferation Treaty review, it is vital that it succeeds above anything else. We believe we have to take practical steps: a comprehensive test ban treaty should come into force; the fissile material cutoff; support for peaceful uses of nuclear energy to find safe ways of making sure that we avoid proliferation  for example, the contributions we make to the nuclear fuel bank  and support for a very strong and effective IAEA. We must work of course especially, as we have said, in areas like the Middle East, which means that we have to continue to put pressure on Iran and address the issues that are raised there.  Mr Severin, on the External Action Service and the priorities that you gave, well, we are in the same place  exactly so. It is very important to me that the Service has political and budgetary accountability, exactly as you have said, and it must be effected in this doublehatted way. It is going to be essential too, as you have indicated, that we draw in and discuss these issues with other key partners. I think you mentioned, for example, Russia and Turkey. Well, Russia I have already visited. I was spending part of the weekend with the Turkish Foreign Minister: a real opportunity to talk in much greater depth about that relationship for the future. So I would agree wholeheartedly with the priorities that you set out and thank you for those.  Mrs NeytsUyttebroeck, thank you for your kind words. I think it was not so much that the EU disappeared from the world stage. It is that the inevitability of that hiatus, of having a Commission that was effective, has now been resolved. And, for my own part, it has been extremely important because, until the Commission came into force, I did not even have a cabinet, never mind an External Action Service. And we are now in a position where we can begin to put the resources together.  I think it is also absolutely right that you raise the importance of being visible on the ground. My difficulty, as you know, is that I have not yet learned how to time travel. But I think it is absolutely essential that, as we look ahead, we look at the priorities that have been set out with which I think this House will largely agree and make sure that my actions are addressed to those priorities, one of which is setting up the Service, which does not yet exist. It does not have a staffing structure. It is not there yet. But when it does have that, we will be able to demonstrate the force of Europe in the best sense of that word across the world.  Mrs Brantner, again your common theme to me of trying to get as much detail as possible: I think it is very important. Some of the issues that you have raised are very critical. We do not want duplication within the different institutions in terms of what we do. We want the geographical desk approach to what we do, and I agree with you about peacebuilding: that it is a very important part of where the EU should act.  And in a sense, it comes into building the different elements of what we do well  the work we do on statebuilding, on justice, on the rule of law, the work we do on development programmes, the work we do on tackling the issues of climate change, the work that we do on providing support to governments and to people  all of that is engineered to make us more secure, stable and prosperous but actually, by doing so, we are creating a more secure, stable and prosperous world.  Those objectives are extremely important.  I agree with you completely about women. We need to get more women, for example, into our policing missions, where there are very few that I have seen so far. We need to make sure that women are firmly integrated into the service at all levels. That is a challenge we need to make sure that we address. But, most importantly, what I would say to you is that the External Action Service is at the service of the whole of the European Union.  So, what we do on justice and home affairs across the world, what do parliamentarians wish to do with other parliaments? We must use the Service as we build it to be able to be your servant in helping you address those issues on the ground. I think on those issues, we are in exactly the same place.  Mr Tannock: assertive leadership that is up to the challenge. Well, I hope that you will start to see what you would recognise as assertive leadership. It is very important, as you say, that we address some of these critical issues: the Balkans and the transatlantic relationship are absolutely core and central to what we do. It is why we spend a lot of time in discussion with the United States and why I personally spend a lot of time in discussion and dialogue with them and, of course, Ukraine.  I hope that you were pleased with my decision to go to the inauguration and then to invite President Yanukovich to come to Brussels where he spent one of his first days. He was inaugurated on Thursday. He was in Brussels on Monday in order to begin to further and deepen that relationship for the future.  Mr Meyer, you talked about the issues of foreign policy and disarmament and the issues of whether it is appropriate to think in military terms. Let me just give you two very quick examples, one of which I have already described which was at Atalanta and the importance of having a comprehensive approach to what we do.  We have, off the coast of Somalia, ships which have been extremely successful this weekend, by the way, with the French navy in capturing pirates who were determined to create havoc in that part of the sea. Linked to that is making sure that they are prosecuted and treated properly by reference to our own judicial standards in the countries of that region.  Linked to that is the development programme that the Commission is working on to try and support the economy in Somalia so that it improves. Linked to that is the work that we are about to start on training people to be able to provide security in the region. In other words, it is a joinedup approach and it is a comprehensive approach. That means you use the tools that you need to be able to address the problems that people face.  Another example: having been in Haiti last week, I must pay tribute to the Italians that I saw working there. People fresh from the tragedy of Aquila, but here we had the navy, we had the fire fighters, we had NGOs, we had civilians, we had doctors, we had psychiatrists, we had dentists, we had nurses, all working under the umbrella of the commander, actually, of the ship who had a hospital ship full of people who were being treated from the direct consequences of the earthquake. Young people with amputations; children who had terrible burns who were being treated; teams out there to support them.  What I am trying to say is that I think you have to think about the comprehensive strategy and approach that we can offer that involves using the means that we have and using them to greatest effect.  Mr Provera, on development cooperation immigration, you make an important point, which is that, if people feel they have no other choices, then they will take risks, often with their lives, to leave the country where they live and were born and want to live. Most people want to be able to live in the country in which they have grown up.  So the important thing about development, in my view, has always been to be able to support the economic livelihoods of people in order to enable them to be able to stay and live where they wish to live in order to be able to get the educational support, the health support and so on.  That is going to be a very big part of what we are doing on the ground, and that helps particularly in states where instability, because of climate change, could be very difficult.  Finally, Mr Mlzer, do not be so pessimistic, is what I want to say to you. It is not about operating above the heads of Member States. It is about building something uniquely European  not the same as what happens in Member States, whether it is Germany, Italy, France, the UK or wherever. It is not the same. We are building something different that is about longterm security and stability, economic growth on the ground that we can contribute to that is in our interest but that actually is also about the values that we hold dear.  And, as for my languages, oui, je peux parler franais, mais je ne suis pas trs bien en franais. Ich habe auch zwei Jahre in der Schule Deutsch gelernt, aber ich habe es jetzt vergessen.  So I can do the languages, and I will get better and better. I look forward to getting to the point where I can have a real conversation with you in much better German than I can do today.
2900745 author: Sebastian Corless:  VicePresident of the CommissionHigh Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  Mr President, I welcome very much the opportunity to discuss with you what I believe is an evolving Arctic policy in the European Union. It is a serious issue of growing political importance and I believe we have to treat it as such.  In the aftermath of the Copenhagen negotiations, it is right that we pay increasing attention to that part of the world which has been witnessing the most tangible effects of climate change. Scientific evidence shows that the ice caps lost more than half of their thickness over the last decade.  Other environmental changes are also having a growing impact on the Arctics people, biodiversity and landscape, both on land and at sea. Like other international actors, we have been increasingly active on Arctic issues. As you know, the Commission published its Arctic Communication in late  2008 , which was welcomed by the Council, and that was followed in December  2009  by extensive conclusions on Arctic issues.  I believe this represents another step in the process to gradually building up a coherent, comprehensive Arctic policy. As you know, the Commission has been asked to prepare a followup report in June  2011 , and that will be another opportunity to further develop our thinking together. All this work is in progress, and that is why I am very eager today to hear the views of Members of this House.  In this context, the Commission appreciated your resolution on Arctic governance of October  2008 , which provided good impetus in the last stages of the Commissions drafting of the communication. We seek support from Parliament for our efforts to ensure the European Union is recognised as a responsible and respected player in the Arctic. Our geographical position and our ongoing programmes in the Arctic are our starting point, but we want to develop this further.  There are three main areas for the work which I would like to mention very briefly. First we want to contribute to the protection of the Arctic region, including its population. The Arctics ecosystem is very fragile and therefore needs maximum protection and safeguards. At the same time, because of climate change, the resources of the Arctic are becoming increasingly accessible. That offers opportunities, but must be handled with great care.  We want to ensure our citizens and companies are treated fairly, including in the areas of transport and natural resources, and that needs to be done in a very deliberate and careful manner with appropriate environmental safeguards. Both objectives can and should be developed jointly by EU institutions and Member States, especially the three Arctic Member States. All should continue to work closely together with other Arctic stakeholders.  Our third objective is to contribute to robust and enhanced governance arrangements to handle the multiple challenges that affect the Arctic region. That includes the implementation of existing agreements, frameworks and arrangements, including the Arctic Council, and full respect for the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas. But, where relevant, we should take a careful look at whether and how these arrangements could be complemented and developed further.  To be credible, we should recognise that the Arctic region is radically different from the Antarctic and this recognition should guide our policy response. Unlike the Antarctic, which is a vast and inhabited continent surrounded by an ocean, the Arctic is a maritime space surrounded by land which has been inhabited by people for thousands of years and which belongs to sovereign countries. Therefore, proposals to replicate the Antarctic Treaty in the Arctic region would be unrealistic, and they would probably also be detrimental to the proactive role that we aim to develop.  As you know, this is also the view of the Council. We very much want to maintain close cooperation with the European Parliament as we pursue our common goals of gradually building up an EU Arctic policy and we must work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations.
9330460 author: Roger Cameron:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, only two weeks after the dreadful disaster on Madeira, the Commission was again shocked and saddened by the death and devastation caused by storm Xynthia in France and other European countries.  I wish to express my personal sympathy to all those that are suffering as a consequence of the disaster. The Commissions condolences go in particular to the families and friends of those that have lost their lives.  Through the monitoring and information centre for civil protection, the Commission has been monitoring the events caused by storm Xynthia closely and has offered to set the mechanism for EU assistance in action. Fortunately, the French rescue services were able to respond to the disaster with their own means and did not request the activation of the mechanism.  Together with the relevant authorities in the Member States, the Commission is now exploring all the possibilities and instruments that could be available at EU level to assist financially in overcoming the disaster and to help return to normal living conditions as soon as possible.  Two days ago, Commission President Barroso met French President Sarkozy to discuss the situation. Yesterday he also met with a number of Members of this House from different countries. One week ago my colleague, Mr Hahn, Commissioner responsible for regional policy and the Solidarity Fund, visited the most hardhit regions in France  La Rochelle and lAiguillonsurMer  and met with national and regional authorities.  On Madeira, where disaster struck two weeks earlier, the authorities and rescue services have been able to make enormous progress in combating the effects of the flooding disaster. Commissioner Hahn visited Madeira during the past weekend to get a firsthand impression and to discuss with the local authorities the way forward.  The European Union Solidarity Fund was set up in  2002  specifically as the instrument at EU level to financially assist EU Member States affected by major natural disasters, if certain conditions are met. France has already declared its intention to apply for assistance from the Solidarity Fund. I should point out that the Regulation governing the Solidarity Fund normally allows its mobilisation only for what are known as major disasters, where the damage at national level exceeds the threshold of  0 . 6  of gross national income, or EUR  3  billion at  2002  prices. For France this currently means the damage would have to exceed approximately EUR  3 . 4747  billion at current prices.  However, in exceptional circumstances and if specific criteria are met, the fund may also be used for smaller extraordinary regional disasters, in particular where they concern outermost regions like Madeira.  The French authorities are currently carrying out an assessment of the damage and of its repercussions for the economy and the living conditions of the population.  These are the essential elements for the application, which has to reach the Commission within  10  weeks of the disaster. That means before  9  May. After it is received it will be examined by the Commission as quickly as possible. The Commission services, in particular DG Regional Policy, are granting all possible assistance and guidance in preparing the application. Contacts at expert level are well established with the French authorities, thus allowing effective progress.  Please be aware, however, that aid from the Solidarity Fund cannot be paid out immediately. The Solidarity Fund should not be misunderstood as an emergency instrument. It is a financial instrument to help bear the financial burden of emergency operations. As such, a possible grant could be used retroactively for emergency operations from day one of the disaster.  The funding for the Solidarity Fund is raised through an extra effort of the Member States outside the normal European Union budget. It has to be approved by Parliament and the Council through an amending budget procedure.  As you know, the whole procedure  from the moment the application is made to paying out the grant  inevitably takes several months. The Commission is, however, making every effort to keep this time span as short as possible.  As regards the Structural Funds, in particular the ERDF, this can of course not be used for immediate emergency operations. France and the Commission have, however, started discussing the options and possible necessary programme modifications which might be instrumental for longerterm reconstruction and for investment in businesses affected by the flood.  One last point, which Members of this House already raised during the debate on Madeira two weeks ago. The Commission will use the current political momentum to attempt to unblock the proposal for an amended Solidarity Fund regulation at the Council. Parliament widely supported this proposal, and I feel this is the right moment to take common action visvis the Council again.
906521 author: Katarina Reid:  President of the Commission.  Mr President, it is indeed a very good and timely opportunity for us to meet today  one day before the important Spring European Council. We have challenging tasks ahead of us. For those tasks, the fresh and forceful backing of the European Parliament is of great importance. Having said this, I want to thank and congratulate Parliament for its resolution on Europe  2020 , which it adopted in Strasbourg two weeks ago with broad party support.  I also want to take the opportunity to thank the Spanish Presidency of the Council for its support for the Europe  2020  strategy. That support was clearly expressed at different formations of the Council of Ministers.  But now to the European Council: I believe every European Council must do two things. It must show that it is responding to the needs of the moment, and it must work on Europes longterm strategic framework and longterm strategic objectives.  The crisis entails several pressing concerns for communities, workers and businesses across Europe. And, as we know, public finances at national level are under unprecedented strain. The European Union must of course tackle these issues, including financial stability. I will come back to this again later.  Europe must not make the mistake of neglecting the imperative of working now to bring about longterm change. That is why the European Council will deal with two of our most obvious longterm challenges: our economic future, and climate change.  We have already debated the Europe  2020  strategy together in this Parliament. Your contribution and your commitment will be indispensable in carrying through our ambitions for smart, sustainable, inclusive growth. So, too, will be the contribution of the European Council.  Our level of ambition must be set by the scale of the tasks ahead. We need to show that we have the vision and the coherence to act. And we must be able to communicate this, to show people that our actions will make a difference where it matters. This is why I believe it is so important that the European Council agrees clear targets this week.  The targets which the Commission has put on the table were carefully chosen. They address the need to increase the level of employment, to invest more in research and innovation, to meet our  2020  climate and energy targets, to improve our educational performance and to combat poverty.  These five headline targets pinpoint objectives which people can relate to, and show that the European Union is leveraging reform in areas that everybody knows are important. This is also about the political will to tackle tough problems.  Of course, the targets must be achievable. They should also require an extra effort compared to the status quo, a recognition by our Member States that change is needed, and I will try to convey to the European Council this sense of urgency for the economic situation of Europe now and for the need of reforms for a more sustainable, more inclusive economy and society in Europe.  What is really important is the measures which each Member State will take to boost its growth rate and address the shortcomings we all know are there. We need national measures to address national problems defined according to national circumstances and in full respect of subsidiarity, but set within a common European framework.  If there is a lesson from the financial crisis, it is that we are all interdependent in the world. So we cannot accept the principles of interdependence globally and reject them when discussed at European level.  A common framework, too, which is supported and should be stimulated by particular European Union measures, what we call in our document flagship initiatives.  These flagship proposals will show the European Union level acting in critically important areas such as the digital agenda, innovation, resource efficiency and industrial policy  and, of course, in some cases, will also help targets to be achieved at a national level.  What we are proposing here is a new departure. Thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, we can go for a new approach to economic coordination, a reinforced economic governance of Europe  one which gives the freedom necessary to target at the national level, but which brings a strong European dimension, and using all the instruments at European level to kickstart the economy. Accepting this approach will be the real test for the European Council.  I am encouraged by the results of the informal European Council. I hope that the European leaders will be present and say yes when it comes to responding to these challenges in a collective spirit.  Regarding climate change, I know that this Parliament shares my conviction that climate change is not a subject that can be put on the back burner. We need to keep this top of our agenda.  The European Union has been in the lead, and we still are  we alone have the reduction commitments clearly backed up with the mechanisms to deliver; we are the number one donors of aid to developing countries on climate issues. So let us move on from soulsearching about Copenhagen and take the initiative once again.  We need a clear, unified and ambitious position. That is why the Commission has put forward a communication setting out the steps needed to reinvigorate international negotiations. At the same time, Commissioner Hedegaard has started a set of consultations with our key partners.  So we should make a serious effort to advance at Cancn  building on the very real substance of the Copenhagen Accord. We should keep Kyoto on the agenda, but make clear that it can only be assessed in the light of a global agreement and not before. We should step up outreach activities and build trust, most obviously with developing countries  which is why respecting our pledges on faststart finance is so important.  And of course, at the same time, we will continue to implement our  202020  package, showing, in particular, how it is compatible with the work of economic modernisation and reform set out in the  2020  strategy.  These two areas show vividly how Europeans are looking to the European Unions political leadership for action. I am convinced that, if we have the will to be bold, we can show Europe as the decisive influence in building the right future for our citizens.  It is in the same spirit that I will present to the European Council some of the major challenges for the G 20  that will take place in June in Canada. In fact, we should never forget that some of those issues are European but they should also be addressed at global level.  Financial stability and the economic and financial situation in Greece are not on the formal agenda of this European Council. However, frankly speaking, I cannot see how it is possible for Heads of State or Government, notably those in the euro area, not to discuss this issue. Let me therefore state our position on this.  Greece is currently in the process of correcting its excessive government deficit. Bringing the deficit down vigorously is crucial and Greece has been taking measures to that effect. In particular, Greece is taking measures leading to a reduction of its deficit this year by  4  of GDP. Such fiscal effort is in line with the course of action recommended by the Commission and the Council, as acknowledged by the Council on  16  March. Naturally, Greeces fiscal effort must be continued; it is the only way to secure a lasting reduction in the cost of debt financing.  In response to the economic and financial situation in Greece, the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government on  11  February stated that, and I quote, euro area Member States will take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  The Commission believes it is now appropriate to create, within the euro area, an instrument for coordinated action which could be used to provide assistance to Greece in case of need. It should be clear that the creation of such a mechanism will not imply its automatic activation. Creating such a mechanism is also a question of responsibility and solidarity.  Solidarity is a twoway street. Greece is making an economic effort at this point and by supporting this effort, we not only help Greece, but the stability of the eurozone as a whole. The framework for coordinated action should be understood as a safety net to be used only when all other means to avoid a crisis have been exhausted, including, first and foremost, exhausting the scope for policy action at domestic level.  Beyond technical aspects, any possible solution must reinforce and strengthen the unity and the coherence of the eurozone and its governance. The world economy needs stability. The eurozone is a pole of stability, and it is important that its capacity to provide stability is further enhanced. We may need to resort to intergovernmental instruments for some issues, but they need to be embedded into a joint European framework.  It is my firm conviction that the response to the specific challenges will also be a test to European leaders and to their commitment to the European  and monetary  Union. What is at stake is the essential principle of financial stability that is central to the euro; and the euro is one of the most important creations of the European project and the European construction process so far.  I hope this issue will be solved in a spirit of responsibility and solidarity. That is the European way to do it.  (Applause)
1689385 author: Mary Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I would really like to thank Parliament for putting this very important item on the agenda. I would like to personally thank my dear friend, Diego Lpez Garrido, and the Spanish Presidency, for keeping this on top of the Spanish Presidencys agenda, because I believe that the instrument we are going to have will really change the way we do politics in the European Union.  Until now, the European construct was based on representative democracy. I think this was very well reflected also in the Lisbon Treaty, where it is very clear that Parliaments powers are very much strengthened and when we are going to include the national parliaments more in the European legislative process. And we needed to complement it with greater inclusion of citizens in this process, through this instrument of participatory democracy.  There was the debate, a while ago, on whether one cancels out the other and whether it is a zerosum game. I really do not think so because I consider both elements of representative and participatory democracy as mutually reinforcing, and both help to create real European political and public space.  I also believe that, thanks to this instrument, we will underline even more the importance of European citizenship for Europeans. As Diego has already said, I am also convinced that this would lead to stronger, better crossborder Europewide debates in Europe, more on European topics, and not only on national topics that we see so often in the capitals of our Member States.  The Commission was and is very grateful for the work the European Parliament has already done on the European Citizens Initiative. For us, the resolution you adopted on  7  May last year was very important political guidance and a very important pointer as to how we should prepare this initiative.  As you know, the Commission, when preparing such important pieces of legislation like this one, wants to engage the European public in as wide a discussion as possible. Therefore, we organised a public debate on this issue, based on the Green Paper that we issued in December last year.  I must say that we have been very positively surprised by the responses we have got. We got more than  300  responses coming from a range of contributors: individual citizens, organisations, public authorities and even some national parliaments.  We evaluated the responses we got and completed the consultation process with a public debate in Brussels, where more than  150  stakeholders were in attendance, including honourable representatives of Parliament.  If I had to sum up this debate, I would say that there were a lot of innovative, interesting and positive suggestions coming to the Commissions table. What were the major conclusions? That citizens are very much interested in having this initiative in place as soon as possible, that they would like to have it as userfriendly as possible, that they would like to have it simple, straightforward, understandable and, most of all, accessible.  And, as you would agree, these are clear and very important parameters for having this legislation prepared in this way, because only these parameters would guarantee that citizens would use this instrument for better communication with the Commission and with the European institutions.  Drawing on the results of the consultations and also on the proposals made by the European Parliament, the Commission is currently finalising its proposal. I hope that the College will adopt the proposals we are working on on  31  March. I can also tell you that this probably would not be possible without strong encouragement from the Spanish Presidency. It is very clear that such a top priority for the Presidency must be respected, and I know there is strong commitment from Spain to try to make progress on this initiative within the term of its Presidency.  So, I am very hopeful that, thanks to the constructive approach of the Presidency, the Council and Parliament, we will have this new and very important instrument in place well before the first anniversary of the Lisbon Treaty coming into force.
7217047 author: Marc Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I would first like to thank Diego for an excellent summary of todays debate. I would like to thank all of you for your support and positive expectations linked to the citizens initiative. I can assure you that I will be happy to present to you the proposal at the earliest convenience after its adoption.  Because of time constraints and the fact that the proposal is not yet finalised, we could not go into details today. However, I am very thankful for your views and opinions because they really reflected the nature and the quality of the views and opinions we have been collecting in the preparations of the European Citizens Initiative.  There are many things on which we all agree. The first one is, clearly, transparency. I can assure you that we are looking for a solution which would guarantee, through the registration of the initiative by the Commission, that we would know who the organisers are and how they are financed. We would have a very strong indication whether the initiative is really genuine, whether it is really a citizens initiative, and whether it is really a European initiative. I think it must include all these elements in order to make good and successful use of this new instrument.  We all agree on practicality. We would like to have a system which is userfriendly. We would like to create a system where the citizens would not have the feeling that they have to go through a very burdensome procedure to collect or to give their signatures. We are looking into these opportunities and, of course, we are looking into ways in which modern IT technology  so characteristic of our century  can be used.  It is clear that there are different systems for the verification of signatures in the Member States. One of the clear responses we gathered from the public consultation was that the citizens would prefer having a certain uniformity when it comes to the verification and the collection of signatures. At the same time, we got the clear message from the Member States that we should look for a system which would not be too burdensome or too complicated for the national authorities, because it would be the Member States who would have to verify that the signatures collected for the citizens initiative are real and genuine.  I listened very carefully to your calls for having very clear procedures once the initiative is successful and once the signatures are collected. I would like to assure you that we will definitely do that. In the proposal, there will be very clear deadlines  when, how and in what timeframe the Commission will have to react when the citizens initiative is successful.  As you have listened to the opinions here, you will agree with me that the most difficult issue we have to tackle is the issue of admissibility  how we can find a solution which would avoid the frustration of citizens, how we can protect EU values, and how we can keep this institute of the European Citizens Initiative serious and real. I can assure you that there are no easy answers to these questions and to these slightly contradictory requests.  The Commission is looking into the option which would defend European values and human rights from the outset. At the same time, we would like to have a clear view that the proposals for the citizens initiative have a genuine potential to be successful.  We would like to avoid possible abuse where we might get proposals for the initiative every second week on nonsensical issues on which there would be an obligation to pronounce a view on admissibility, and then for it to be appealed to the Court  initiatives whose only reason for proposal would be the selfpromotion of the potential organisers for negative political agenda. We have also to bear this in mind. I hope that we will find the right balance on how to keep this admissibility check in adequate proportion.  To give a short answer to VicePresident Durants question concerning communication with civil society, I think that the European Citizens Initiative is the best answer. We have a very good structured dialogue organised by the European Economic and Social Committee and I had a very lengthy debate with them just two weeks ago. I think that strong and wide public consultations are taking place through the smartlegislating proposals. We will widen this and use it even more in the future.  In view of the time, let me conclude by saying that I am really looking forward to being back soon with a proposal. I look forward to our mutual discussion on this issue and what I hope will be very dynamic and speedy procedures so that we can have this very important instrument approved as soon as possible.
8416335 author: Victor Corless:  on behalf of the ALDE Group.  Mr President, I would like to make two remarks on last months Council. The first concerns the mechanism which the Council decided on for Greece and about which I have serious doubts. I hope that I am wrong, but I do not think that it can work for the simple reason that it is a system of bilateral loans and not a system  a European solution  under which a single loan is made by the European Commission to Greece, which was the initial idea.  (Applause)  If you look at the markets, it is very apparent at the moment that they do not believe in this system. This did not start yesterday, but a week ago now. Last Monday  one week ago  there was already an issue surrounding Greek bonds being at an interest rate of nearly  6 . That is  300  base points higher than the lowest interest rate in the European Union, which is  3 . Since there is now a discussion inside the European Union between different Member States about what the interest rate applicable to the bilateral loans should be, that even increased yesterday to  400  base points, which is  4 .  That is not the way to help Greece. Greece has to take the measures which are necessary, but not with bilateral loans. That mechanism is not in fact helping Greece, but punishing it at the moment.  It is absolutely necessary that the European Commission return as fast as possible to its initial idea of a European loan, issued by the European Commission. Then you will automatically have lower interest rates than those on the markets today, because there will be this guarantee from the European Commission and the European institutions. That is the only way to help the Greek Government achieve its targets.  At the same time, the Greek Government naturally has to stop its internal struggles. If there are differing points of view with regard to intervention by the International Monetary Fund, and should such discussions continue, then interest rates will also automatically increase.  My second point is that what we need now is more than merely a mechanism for Greece or other countries. What we need now is a courageous European Commission coming forward with a package of economic reforms and monetary reforms, and we need those as fast as possible. What we need now is a package of the magnitude which we had in the past from Jacques Delors, who at a certain moment came forward with a package of European economic and monetary union, or the internal market, to solve the problems. We need that now. We need a courageous package. Only the European Commission can do this. The Council cannot do it  not even the President of the Council. It is the Commission which has the right of initiative, and it is the Commission who must now come forward with a real package.  (Applause)  My group feels that three main elements are needed in that package. The first is the creation of a European Monetary Fund, which is absolutely necessary and was an idea also floated by Mr Schuble, the German Minister for Finance. We need that fund as fast as possible, in order to increase the effectiveness of the Stability Pact.  The second thing we need, as soon as possible, is for the European bond market to lower interest rates for all the countries in the European Union. That is not a punishment for the biggest country, Germany. On the contrary, you can have a system in which Germany pays lower interest rates than today because we can have a liquidity premium attached to the European bond market in the future. The technical means to do this exist and can be made applicable.  The third thing we need is a bolder  2020  Strategy. I fully support what Mrs WortmannKool said a few moments ago about our needing a stronger governance method. It is not through the open coordination method that we will fulfil our goals. What we need is a method with sticks and carrots, as Mrs WortmannKool put it, with not only the Member States, but also the Commission, in the drivers seat.  Colleagues, we have to think about something: if the Council does not in the coming months do what is necessary in terms of a bolder  2020  Strategy, then what can we as the European Parliament do? What we can do is: in the coming weeks Parliament has to agree to the broad economic guidelines and to give an opinion on them. Well, if the Council has not come forward, supported by the Commission, with a bolder  2020  Strategy, then I see no need to approve those broad economic guidelines. First of all, there must be a bold proposal, which I hope will be on the table in June, and then we can do our job and approve this bolder approach and the broad economic guidelines.
10361325 author: Nancy McNabb:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, honourable Members, and, of course, especially Mrs Trpel, we are absolutely fascinated by your report. We welcome it. I think that indeed Europeana  the next steps is just a start of a very challenging adventure and it shows, by the way, the strong political support for the further development of Europeana as a common access point to Europes rich and diverse cultural heritage in the digital age.  So I would like to thank Mrs Trpel, the rapporteur, for the work she has done and also give her my compliments for the branding, since the branding itself is already unique: Europeana  you do not need to explain what it is all about.  The Commission can also support the alternative motion for a resolution, which has the agreement of the main political groups in Parliament, I have been informed.  It is an ambitious project and again, I repeat, it is the start. It aims to make digitised books, newspapers, maps, museum objects, audiovisual material and sound archives from across Europe available on the Internet. That is essential to ensure access to culture in the digital age. It is not only what Mr Migalski said: something that makes us better citizens. Well, let us wait and find out, but, anyhow, it gives an opportunity to be more happy, for enjoying culture is, in most cases, enjoying happiness, so to speak.  It is Parliaments report that rightly underlines that there is also an economic component. The digitisation and the online accessibility of our cultural heritage will benefit different sectors of activity: think of education, research, tourism and the media.  The Europeana site is the result of an unprecedented collaboration between European libraries, archives and museums. At present, as was rightly mentioned by Mrs Trpel, it gives direct access to  7  million digitised objects. Again, this is just a start and let us go for it. More can be done and more needs to be done. The Parliament report highlights different areas for Europeana and for the related policies where progress must be made in the coming years.  The development of the site depends, in the first place, on the input from Member States who should do more to digitise their cultural heritage and to make all digitised objects available through Europeana. I am glad that Parliament joins the Commission in asking Member States to make fast progress in doing so. The sooner the better.  Parliament underlines that Europeana should not just give access to public domain works, but should also include material that is still in copyright. Indeed, there is an urgent need  and that is my answer to Mrs icu  to find workable solutions for bringing outofprint works online, for dealing with the issue of orphan works (works for which it is impossible to locate the rights holders). Failing to do so bears the risk that Europe will lag behind within a few years from now, in particular, compared to the US.  At present, the Commission is carrying out an impact assessment on a possible legal solution for orphan works at European level and we are discussing what could be done, but if you do not mind, I will come back to that when we talk of the digital agenda, for that is one of the issues that we have to touch upon.  An enhanced version of Europeana will be launched later this year, and is expected to give, by then, access to more than  10  million digitised objects. The site will be further developed in the years thereafter. Parliament rightly points out that for the success of Europeana, it is a must to increase the awareness of the site both among cultural institutions, who could contribute their digitised content, and among the general public. Special attention should be given to younger people, rightly mentioned by you, an extremely important part of our population, who could be targeted through the schools.  The Commission is fully committed to continuing work on the development of Europeana and the policies related to it and that will be a key area of work in the European Digital Agenda. It is anyhow worthwhile to fight for it.
2800108 author: Philip Cameron:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, at the New York International donors conference, the European Union pledged EUR  1 . 235  billion. We are the largest donor to Haitis reconstruction so, in this way, we will also be the largest contributor to the government of Haitis action plan for reconstruction. I am also proud about the manner in which we did it because it was an EU common pledge, which consisted of support from many EU countries, like Spain, France and the wider Community. But I am also proud that even my country, which has not had too many relations with Haiti, pledged additional funding, not just the funding channelled through the Community budget.  The New York conference took place in a very good spirit. There was a very strong financial outcome, there was very clear ownership of Haitis Government and there were many stakeholders. Some Members of the European Parliament could see that NGOs, including European NGOs, had a voice there. EU businesses have also been involved and also interim mechanisms for coordination, proposed under the leadership of Prime Minister Bellerive and Bill Clinton. As all the stakeholders are included in this mechanism, it gives a guarantee that money will not be wasted or used for other purposes.  It is very important now that we concentrate our aid as quickly as possible. The Commission and Member States are already preparing a new country strategy paper and a national indicative programme for Haiti. To support our joint efforts, we will speed up our efforts to set up an EU House in Haiti, which would give greater visibility but will also help involve nonresident donors.  I shall be going to Haiti this week to deliver firsthand concrete support to longterm reconstruction in the areas of infrastructure and governance. This week, I will sign five financial agreements for a total amount of more than EUR  200  million and I will also inaugurate some of the work we have already done like the rehabilitation of the road between PortauPrince and Cape Haitian, which is fully in line with the plan of action of the government and which also supports the wholeoftheisland approach.  To reinforce the government capacities, I will also inaugurate the reconstruction of the Ministry of the Interior, financed with EU contributions. I will also inaugurate a school in Mirabelais. Our particular focus is on education, as President Prval has requested, and we will also announce more budget support delivery. Delivering budget support is not blind support. We have taken many precautionary measures and undertaken many visits, so I can guarantee that your money will be used for its purpose.  I will also commit to regulatory monitors for the construction process through regular visits and to speed up aid delivery. I will keep the European Parliament constantly informed of the progress made on Haiti reconstruction.  I would also like to emphasise that it is not only me but the whole college: Kristalina Georgieva, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and also some of my other colleagues who will help oversee the reconstruction, such as Michel Barnier, who will go to Haiti in a couple of months. It is the ownership not only of the responsible commissioner, but of the whole College.  We also need to discuss with the authorities a couple of issues on how to better deliver our assistance. Longterm commitment from the international community will not prevail if Haiti quickly slips back to a business as usual approach. To prevent this scenario, we must strive to be effective and we have already mentioned some of the ways in which we can achieve this. But equally, there is great responsibility resting with the authorities and the people of Haiti to build in a better way.  Two aspects stand out, in particular. On the social front, the government should be encouraged to enter into very close contact with the opposition and also with the whole civil society. That will build genuine national consensus around the development plan and promote the stability necessary for its implementation. On the economic side, the macroeconomic framework presented in New York must be more rigorous and combined with a clear path towards employment and growth, which will break the cycle of poverty and inequality.
1801461 author: James Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, with your permission, I shall leave a bit of time for Mr Piebalgs to take on some of the longterm reconstruction questions.  This has been very useful and very encouraging for us. Before I turn to the questions, let me join Mr Guerrero Salom in expressing sympathy to the families of the four Spanish soldiers who died, and also all those who lost their lives during the disaster and now in the recovery efforts in Haiti.  I would like to start with the bigger policy issue, on the EU improving its response capabilities. I was very pleased to see my colleague, Commissioner Barnier, in the room because of the effort he has put into this topic. On  26  April, we will have a chance in the Development Committee to discuss in more detail the work programme, which includes, for  2010 , strengthening the response capacity and a communication on this topic.  I can assure you that this is a very high priority for our team. We will work very closely with Member States and with Parliament to come up with a solution that improves our capacity to respond to disasters, and there is a very simple logic behind it. At a time when the intensity and frequency of disasters are increasing and the budgets of our countries are going to be tight for years to come, there is no other way but to strengthen European coordination and to build an asset base that can be deployed effectively in terms of impact, cost and results. I can tell you that tomorrow, we are going to our first country visit on this topic. This is going to be a very high priority for our team in the coming months.  Let me turn to four questions that have been posed.  The first is on the question of combining a response to immediate priorities with longterm reconstruction and our staying power. This is really important because if we move too quickly to reconstruction, away from support for people in need, we risk a very serious tragedy. We had to deal with this in the issue of food delivery where the government of Haiti suggested that we shift away from food provision to only cashforwork and foodforwork, which is highly desirable but cannot be done everywhere at the same time. This is something we are watching very closely.  Broadly, on the issue of food security, our new policy in the European Union is very progressive because it emphasises all other things equally, encouraging local purchase of food for humanitarian aid whenever it is possible to get it locally. We have made this topic subject to a discussion in a morning session in New York where we invited NGOs, Haitian as well as international NGOs, and I was very proud that it was the European NGOs that put these issues of agricultural security for Haiti and high agricultural return in productivity for the discussion in Haiti.  I want to address the issue of shelter. It is not at all a trivial issue because people actually do not want to move from where they are now. They do not want to move for a variety of reasons. One, even if their houses are safe, they are afraid to go back because of the trauma they experienced. Two, because they moved as whole neighbourhoods and they are scared of losing the social fabric that keeps them together, so it is not just bad policy or lack of desire; it is also the social phenomenon that follows a disaster of this nature that makes it not so easy to get people to move from floodprone areas to safer ground. But we are addressing this as a priority.  Let me finish with the question of longterm sustainability. It is governance sustainability, it is also ecological sustainability. I had the dubious privilege to fly over Haiti and Chile, within a couple of weeks of each other. In Haiti, an ecologically destroyed island, of course it had implications for the scale of this destruction. In Chile, the government has implemented for decades a reafforestation programme stabilising the soil and, as a result, creating a better environment, which is obviously very helpful for people. We are thinking in the long term when we think of Chile.  This is not in my area but I have to pick it up as a former World Bank employee. I certainly agree with you that what the World Bank is proposing about this coordination in the multidonor trust fund, but also as an institutional project management approach, is something that we need to take to heart and follow.
2868692 author: Helen Bauer:  High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on Kyrgyzstan. As this House knows very well, the situation on the ground remains somewhat fluid and tense. Kyrgyzstan has attracted quite some media and political attention, and I have followed developments closely from the beginning, making two statements, one on  7  April and the other on  8  April.  I sent a delegation almost immediately, headed by the EU Special Representative, Pierre Morel, to the country and we stayed in close contact throughout his visit.  The coordinated EUUNOSCE effort that started last week in Bishkek continues at the moment and will continue until the crisis and its consequences are overcome. Yesterday, I spoke with the Kazakh Foreign Minister Saudabayev, who today is visiting Bishkek as ChairinOffice of the OSCE, and who has literally just sent me a message to say that he has completed his tasks.  The resignation of the President, on the basis of Article  50  of the present Kyrgyz Constitution, and his departure from the country is expected to reduce political tension. However, that is not the end of the crisis, and we have important work to do.  Most importantly, we have to ensure stability and public order, and while the situation has generally calmed down, violence continues. Reports told us yesterday that as many as five people were killed in riots in the suburbs of Bishkek. All sides need to be careful and avoid provocation. The restoration of law and order must be a priority. Citizens and businesses in Kyrgyzstan need to be able to go about their daily life without fear for their lives or for their physical integrity.  The second issue concerns the legitimacy of the provisional government. Although President Bakiyev has officially resigned, the provisional government needs to commit to a clear plan for how to return to constitutional and democratic order and the rule of law.  Elements of such a roadmap have been announced  a new constitution is being drawn up and submitted to referendum and presidential and parliamentary elections are to be held.  We will be happy to look at such a plan. What is important for us in this context is that the constitutional process is inclusive and participatory. Representatives of all parties and ethnic groups should be able to contribute to a new draft constitution before it is submitted to a referendum.  The early indications  I can tell honourable Members  are encouraging. I hope these will be confirmed over the coming days, and I will discuss this with Ministers in Luxembourg on Monday.  If we are satisfied the provisional government is committed to a quick return to legitimacy and genuinely wants to join the democratic family, we will be ready to provide the necessary political, financial and technical support.  With the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, we could contribute to the work on constitutional reform and the updating of electoral legislation. We know from the presidential elections last year that there is considerable room for progress.  With the OSCE, we are willing to work on the preparations and modalities for monitoring the elections and, with the people of Kyrgyzstan, we are ready to do what we can to help turn their aspirations for a democratic and open society into reality.  Thirdly, it is clear that Kyrgyzstan needs material assistance. In the very short term, we are willing to address any humanitarian needs that recent events might have created.  On the basis of the information that we have had from our partners in the field  the Red Cross and the UN Development Programme  there do not seem to be major unmet humanitarian needs at this stage. However, there may be specific medical needs. The Commission, through DG ECHO, will, of course, keep monitoring the humanitarian situation in the country and adjust as necessary.  We will continue the assistance that is already ongoing, notably in the fields of human rights, education and poverty eradication.  Fourthly, after the dramatic events of the last two weeks, there is a need for accountability and justice. More than  80  persons died and many hundreds were wounded from gunfire opened against demonstrators in Bishkek. These events cannot simply be put on one side. We need clarity brought on what actually happened, on who was responsible, and on what needs to be done to avoid this ever being repeated in the future.  Finally, as the recent crisis has shown, there is a need for genuine economic and social reforms. Unfortunately, the example of Kyrgyzstan shows how bad government and the lack of genuine reform can bring political instability and ultimately violence.  The upheaval and the widespread looting that followed, and now the rise in organised, largescale crime, further aggravates the situation.  I will discuss with Ministers on Monday the political framework in which the European Union will be ready to address the most pressing needs, but of course, today, I am very interested to hear the views of the honourable Members on this matter.
2558546 author: Katarina Finlayson:  VicePresident of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  Mr President, today I sit in the Commissions space as well. The honourable Members have made a number of important points and I will try in the short time I have to capture and address as many of them as possible.  Mr Brok, with Mr Tannock and others, talked about the importance of this being one of the poorest countries in Central Asia and, of course, one of the main recipients of EU assistance per capita. I could not agree more that social and economic development is essential as part of the strategy that we need to put forward. Mrs Swoboda talked too about the importance of making sure that what we have before us is a genuine political reform. We are working very closely with the UN and with the OSCE. Together, the people who have been in the region in the last few days have made this point consistently that we need to see the importance of reform as central to what happens next and I agree completely about the political stability of the region. It is very important.  We need to look again very carefully. There is a strategy for this part of Central Asia, it will be reviewed, but I am looking at it in the context of the External Action Service and what we should be doing within this region to pull together the different elements of Commission and Council support. Mr Rinaldi and others too I think rightly described that we need to be cautious, positive and constructive in our attitude and I would agree too with a number of honourable Members who talked about the value and importance of the rule of law. It is core to everything that we will do in the country to make sure that there is indeed the rule of law in operation and that applies in the legal system of course, but also in the political and constitutional reform that is so essential.  Mr Lunacek talked about the elections falling  I think that the actual words were used in the briefing I had  significantly short of the standards that we would wish to have internationally. And I think the elements which I would put into the mix of things would include financial support, of course, and I have mentioned the rule of law, political and constitutional reform and the elections and the link that we want to make economically too. One small example of that, of course, is that it is one of the great waterrich countries in that region, and it provides water to the regions, as honourable Members will know. We have been assisting them with their water management for more than five years, and I hope that we will be able to return to that work which is so essential as soon as the crisis is overcome and we have a legitimate government firmly in place.  Those are just some of the elements that I would include. I think that we are probably right in the level of presence in the region. Pierre Morel has been there for several days. He has just come back. He will be briefing Mr Borys of the AFET Committee on  27  April to bring the committee up to date with all the events. We are in touch by text every few hours and we have spoken several times and he has been in touch of course with colleagues too. We have had a strong presence in him, I pay tribute to him and to his team for the work that they have done.  The importance of democracy, as Mr Provera said, can never be underestimated, in my view; we have got to get beyond some of the issues that Ms Vaidere talked about: the instability, rumours, insecurities, the issues, which are clearly of enormous importance and, as I have indicated, we have set out what we wanted to do over these first vital few days which I hope honourable Members will feel has been responsive.  I think that the final thing that I would say is this, that some of the current members of the government in formation are the former human rights defenders on the opposition who were oppressed by the former President and who were supported by the European Union including, of course, Members of this House. So, although I do not have any illusions about the nature of politics in this country and, indeed, in the region, I think that we have to try and give this government a chance to form itself properly, to agree to do the political and constitutional reforms, which are going to be so essential, to hold the elections it says it will have and, if it is willing to do those things, to support it now into the future. And on that basis, I am very grateful for the comments which have been made and we will pursue the strategy as I have outlined.
1309525 author: James Reid:  VicePresident of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  Mr President, Canada is one of the oldest and most likeminded partners of the European Union. We work together on a wide range of issues  both bilaterally and, of course, around the world.  Our relationship is anchored in a shared history that goes back a long way and by common values that are deeply held. It is on that basis that we cooperate to protect our common interests. We do so of course for the benefit of citizens in Europe and in Canada, but also to promote security and prosperity worldwide.  So it is an important relationship. We need to nurture and invest in it, so that we realise its full potential. That is the purpose of the next EUCanada Summit which will take place in Brussels on  5  May.  The timing is fortunate. Because it means that, as Canada is chairing the G 8  and G 20  summit at the end of June, our EUCanada Summit allows us to take stock and align our strategies on global themes that will figure on the G 8  and G 20  summits, for example, how to promote a sustainable economic recovery, cooperation on financial market reform and regulation, climate change and combating nuclear proliferation.  I attended the G 8  foreign ministers meeting recently in Canada where, indeed, many of these issues were discussed.  We will also have the chance to discuss EUCanada bilateral relations and how we work together on regional crises. Our aim is to have a focused, businesslike summit.  With our bilateral relations, the summit will deal with efforts to upgrade and modernise the EUCanada relationship. It will offer us an excellent opportunity to provide support at the highest political level to reach an ambitious comprehensive economic and trade agreement as soon as possible.  We will take stock of the progress made during the first three rounds of negotiations but also give new impetus to these negotiations, bearing in mind its importance to expand trade and job creation. On trade more generally, the summit should send a clear signal that the EU and Canada reject protectionism, recalling our commitment to reaching an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced conclusion of the Doha Development Round.  The summit should also address the subject of reciprocal visafree travel. Our goal is clear: we want visafree travel to Canada for all EU citizens as soon as possible.  We will also have a chance to discuss our crisis management cooperation which, I am pleased to say, is expanding rapidly. We have several crisis management operations ongoing, notably our police mission in Afghanistan, where our cooperation with Canada is exemplary.  Haiti will also be on the agenda of the summit for obvious reasons. Canada plays a very important role in Haiti, and one of the areas where we can and should strengthen our joint efforts is in linking crisis management to longerterm development. This was also the point I stressed during the New York conference on Haiti on  31  March which was cochaired by both the EU and Canada, along with France, Spain and Brazil.  Along with my fellow Commissioners for Development, Andris Piebalgs, and for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, Kristalina Georgieva, I was pleased to announce at New York that the EU will contribute over EUR  1 . 2  billion to Haitis reconstruction and development.  The EU and Canada both have a longterm commitment to assist Haiti on the path to reconstruction; to rebuild for a better future.  The summit will cover climate change. Taking into account the postCopenhagen context, adaptation to and mitigation of climate change will continue to top the agenda and will require supportive energy policies. There is wide support for the idea that EUCanada cooperation should focus on financing mechanisms as well as on support to third countries clean development.  The consequence of climate change for the Arctic will be another important element of our discussions at the summit. Nowhere are the effects of climate change more keenly felt than in the Arctic region. Environmental changes have a growing impact on the Arctics people, biodiversity and landscape  both on land and at sea. Protecting the region, including its population, is a key objective of the EUs evolving Arctic Policy, as honourable Members may recall from my presentation during the March Plenary session. With more than  40  of its land mass in the North, Canada shares our interest in protecting the Arctic environment and ensuring the sustainable economic and social development of the region.  Finally, when we talk about upgrading and modernising the EUCanada relationship, we have the  1976  European CommunityCanada framework agreement. This is still in force but outdated. EUCanada cooperation has extended to other fields such as foreign and security policy and closer cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs.  So we need a modernised framework agreement to act as an umbrella for all our sectoral agreements, including the comprehensive economic and trade agreement and we are holding exploratory talks with Canada to upgrade that agreement at the present time.  In a world of big challenges and where change is constant, we need partners. Canada is among the most important the European Union has. We aim for a productive summit with clear results.
8768888 author: Christoph White:  VicePresident of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  Mr President, this has been an extremely useful and valuable debate for the preparations for the summit. Honourable Members have covered a wide range of different topics and I shall not least be making sure that the two presidents  the President of the Commission and the President of the Council  who, of course, will be leading the European Union at the summit, are fully aware of the issues that have been raised.  I am very grateful for the helpful way in which Members of Parliament have given me information, and put questions on areas I have to confess I do not know very much about  for example, on air transport, which I will have to find out about for them.  I would like just to pick up on two or three of the key areas that were discussed. In the context, there seemed to be a general view among honourable Members that this is an important relationship. Perhaps some of the frustrations I felt in the Chamber were because we recognise the importance of Canada and the importance of the shared values that we hold. The frustration of those honourable Members from the countries particularly affected by the visa question is therefore completely understandable.  Let me begin with trade, because quite a lot of the different contributions focused on that. We are right to go for an ambitious trade agreement. This will not be easy and from the very beginning  and I actually launched the trade negotiations  we recognised that, because of the particular interests of the EU and Canada, this was never going to be an easy negotiation. However, we should be very ambitious on both sides.  One example is intellectual property rights, where I am very concerned that Canada needs to make sure it has a proper regime in place. I know that it is looking at that and that the discussions and the rounds so far have been extremely positive and constructive and things are moving at a good pace.  I agree that we need to keep the Committee on International Trade fully informed and, as Mr Bradbourn said, those with a particular interest in Canada also need to be clearly in the loop on that. There will be an impact assessment, which is already being worked on at the present time, and, of course, Parliament will play its role in giving assent or not to the agreement when it is finally put forward. There is a very clear and key role for Parliament there.  All I would add to that are two things. One is that a good trade agreement actually benefits our citizens. That is what it is for. It is to make sure that for consumers, there are greater choices and for workers, there are greater opportunities. We need to ensure that all our trade agreements provide genuine opportunities across the European Union.  On the point on small and mediumsized enterprises, which I agree is very significant, I am reminded that one of the statistics that always struck me as being very interesting is that only  8  of our small and mediumsized enterprises actually trade, and only  3  trade outside of the European Union.  I have always felt, and continue to do so, that if we were able to increase those figures and provide opportunities  and government procurement may indeed be one of the areas where that is a possibility  then that is an opportunity in both directions for our small and mediumsized enterprises to benefit.  A number of honourable Members talked about the Arctic, and we have had discussions about that in recent times in Parliament. I accept that this is a very important issue, not least because it links to the other important issue I wanted to raise before I mention visas, which is climate change.  As far as we are concerned, Canada did belong to the group of countries that, in the Copenhagen negotiations, did not, in our view, take us anywhere near far enough. We can debate Copenhagen further  and no doubt in other conversations with the Commissioner responsible, there will be opportunities to do so. We were interested that, in the Speech from the Throne on  3  March, the Canadian Government stated that it fully supports the Copenhagen climate change accord. That is significant, and what we want to do in the context of the summit is to encourage and urge Canada to be ambitious, notably in increasing its mitigation target for  2020 .  The international carbon market is key in shifting investment towards a lowcarbon economy, and part of what we are able to do in our bilateral relationship is to push forward on those strategic questions of investment, of green technology and of collaboration, in trying to support all the measures we need to take to mitigate the problems of climate change.  The final issue  and there were many, but I just want to pick on three  and one which I, of course, wanted to raise, is the whole question of visas. This is extremely important and, as Member States represented here through their MEPs have mentioned, there are three Member States who are actually affected.  There is a lot of work going on to try and resolve this matter. We have had a lot of dialogue with Canada, a lot of the issues are well known and there are issues for Canada to resolve in terms of the legislation that it needs to put in place for the future. Honourable Members were quite right to raise this question and it will be part of the discussions.  The second expert working group meeting took place in Prague to look at the issues particularly relevant to the Czech Republic, and that has been facilitated by the Commission, so the Commission is fully involved.  I did pick up on, and will take away from this debate, the frustration of honourable Members who have raised the need to work quicker and further to address this problem and to recognise what is absolutely the most significant point of this, which is that this is not a bilateral issue, but a European UnionCanada issue, and we need to address it as such.
976530 author: Katarina Reid:  Member of the Commission.  The Commission has long argued in favour of deepening and broadening euro area economic surveillance. The importance of this issue was recognised by the European Parliament in its report on the  2009  annual statement from the euro area and public finances.  The Commission intends to make full use of the new treaty instruments to achieve stronger policy coordination and governance. A forthcoming communication will outline new proposals in order to frame the development of a comprehensive framework for crisis prevention and correction in the euro area through recourse to the new Article  136  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The communication may include proposals to reinforce the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact  proposals for more effective and broader surveillance of intraeuro area macroeconomic imbalances  and explore the options for the creation of a crisis resolution mechanism for euro area countries.  Regarding fiscal policy, a reinforced emphasis on fiscal sustainability is warranted because of the impact of the crisis on debt and growth potential, as well as the demographic factors kicking in. The incentives for compliance with the preventive and corrective dimensions of the Stability and Growth Pact need to be made stronger. The commitment to consolidation needs to become stronger in good times. Underlying vulnerabilities of public finances should be taken properly into account when designing the optimal consolidation part. New focus should be given to debt dynamics and sustainability and quality of public finances, including national fiscal roots. There is also a need to address cases where the rules are continuously broken; penalties could be made more deterrent and incentives strengthened.  Competitiveness developments and macroeconomic imbalances, on top of fiscal imbalances, are a matter of concern for all EU Member States. However, surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness diversions are particularly warranted for EU Member States that linked to the euro because of the higher degree of economic and financial spillovers across euro area Member States; less market discipline; the absence of exchange rate risks and more challenging adjustment with potentially high cost for the euro area as a whole.  Competitiveness divergences are a cause of serious concern for the functioning of the European Monetary Union. During the decade preceding the crisis, divergence has been underpinned by a worrying buildup of a range of domestic economic imbalances in some Member States including, inter alia, high debt and housing bubbles in some current account deficit countries, as well as entrenched weakness in domestic demand in some surplus countries. Diverging wage and cost trends, the accumulation of a sustainable external debt position and the protracted mythical allocation of resources raised the stake for adjustment and increased vulnerability of public finances. At the same time, countries heavily relying on trade surpluses have fallen victim to the sharp contraction in world trade in the early stages of the global crisis. Therefore, complementing fiscal surveillance, the Commission intends coming forward with proposals for the broadening of economic surveillance in the euro area, addressing macroeconomic imbalances and competitive developments. The aim is to set up a framework for early detection, prevention and effective correction of intraeuro area imbalances.  The third main element in the Commissions proposal will explore the options for setting up a crisis resolution mechanism. The ad hoc mechanism for possible financial assistance for Greece serves the immediate need. However, it is necessary to set up a permanent crisis resolution mechanism with strong builtin disincentives for activation. Establishing ex ante clear, credible and consistent rules and procedures for the provision of exceptional and conditional support for a euro area country in serious distress will bolster the fundaments of the EMU.  The proposals for enhanced economic surveillance and coordination in the euro area are an important complement to the EUs comprehensive  2020  strategy for growth and jobs. The Commission will ensure the efficient articulation between the two frameworks.
7318342 author: Lynne Whittacker:  rapporteur.  Mr President, I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about, so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment.  I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team. I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved  the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency  for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations, as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted  well, sometimes anyway.  So, what did we achieve? The aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent highquality decision making for those in need of protection, and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need. It is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States. Differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not. And those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection.  There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others, that their need for support is not given a real practical response. Under the refugee fund, there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments, but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach.  The Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure. Specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation.  The key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office, how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States, and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office.  The issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links. We have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate, offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account.  The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee  I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that, but still  and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks.  The role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group, and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that  partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office.  As regards solidarity between the Member States, Parliament wanted binding mechanisms, Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation, and the final language is more neutral, but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to, which will cover the Support Offices impact on practical cooperation on asylum.  On the role of the consultative forum, there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States, and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable. We know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs, and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities, which often deliver much of what is required under the common system, also had an opportunity to be included. So we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body.  In conclusion, we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system. We hope it will be of high quality  even if we could not quite get that into the final text  and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support. I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions, elected authorities and civil society can contribute, because, while this is about cooperation between Member States, it is not entirely intergovernmental. It is a European institution we are creating.
1238451 author: Helen Whittacker:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, the collection of TFTP data is important in the fight against terrorism. We know that TFTP data has been helpful to prevent terrorist attacks in Europe, like the  2006  liquid bombs at Heathrow Airport. The TFTP is therefore important, not only for the US, but also for Europe.  I recently met US Home Secretary Napolitano and we addressed this issue. They are fully aware of the need to reform the intermediate agreement that we had but they are also concerned about a number of leads for known terrorists, which are no longer available. So we need to address the security gap but also to do this in a way that ensures full respect of fundamental rights and a sufficient level of data protection.  That is why, after our last discussion on this, the Commission promptly started to work on a new mandate for a new EUUS TFTP Agreement. I think the mandate is ambitious but realistic. It balances the maintenance of our collective security, while addressing fundamental rights and data protection, based on Parliaments resolutions of September last year and of February this year.  I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs HennisPlasschaert, for the very constructive cooperation we have had. The Commission has tried to liaise with her and the corapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs in this matter. I am also grateful to the Presidency for the work they have done to try to get this through the Council.  We have tried to take on board the concerns expressed in the European Parliament resolutions. Data will be processed only for the purpose of terrorism. A request must be based on judicial authorisation. Third parties will not get bulk data. There will be reciprocity. There will be the push basis for transfer, SEPA data will be excluded and we will also address the issue of judicial redress on a nondiscriminatory basis. I will ensure that the Commission will keep Parliament fully and immediately informed throughout the process of negotiations. We aim to sign this agreement before the end of June, so that Parliament can vote on it in July.  On the question of bulk data transfer, I know this is of great concern to the European Parliament but I also know that you do understand that, without bulk transfers, there will be no TFTP. However, legally binding safeguards will ensure that absolutely no data are accessed unless there is an objectively verified reason to believe that an identified person is a terrorist, a suspected terrorist, or is financing terrorism and that those data transfers are anonymous. Transfer of bulk data is, of course, sensitive, and we will strive for further reductions in the volume of data during the negotiations. But we also need to be realistic here. We are unlikely to see a huge reduction in what are already targeted requests.  Reciprocity is part of the mandate. The envisaged agreement would place a legal obligation on the US Treasury to share leads with their EU counterparts and allow EU authorities to have TFTP searches undertaken against known terrorist suspects in the EU. Should the EU develop something similar  an EU TFTP  the Americans should help us in this as well. The Commission is willing to participate in these discussions with Member States.  The mandate calls for a fiveyear retention period for nonextracted data. I believe there is some justification in this, bearing in mind that five years is also the period for financial transaction data that banks are subject to under EU antimoneylaundering legislation, but I am ready to hear Parliaments views on this and take this matter to the Council by the end of the week.  In conclusion, I believe that the draft mandate is a true substantial improvement. It takes into account the concerns of Parliament raised in your resolutions. It takes into account the rapporteurs call for a doubletrack approach that might lead to an EU TFTP, even if this is, of course, something that we have to discuss internally in the EU. It is not part of the negotiations. It does take account of the EUUS relationship in this area as equal partners, which is, of course, the longterm goal in this regard.
3145693 author: Michael Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I think this has indeed been a very constructive debate. We have listened carefully and are taking due notice of everything that has been said. The Council answered quite a lot of the questions that were raised, and I will just add a few things because it is important that we get as much clarity as possible.  There will be an EU review team. They will have the right to review random samples to ensure that the data has been taken in a way that is respected according to the agreement. There must be a reasonable belief that the target of the search is a terrorist or someone financing terrorism. We also must remember that each and every search of TFTP data is verified by a SWIFT scrutineer and by an independent judicial authority before it is given out. The EU review team will also have access to this information.  The agreement will ensure that EU citizens have access to nondiscriminatory administrative and judicial rights. Exactly how this will be specified is, of course, part of the negotiations, so I cannot be more specific on this. But it is  as the Council also said  a very important part of the negotiation. We will have to find a solution to this, and as regards rectification and access.  Data will not be transferred to third countries  only relevant leads analysis but not mass data  and it will only be for terrorism purposes. The whole deal is only for terrorism purposes. The agreement will also ensure that EU nationals, via their data protection authorities, have the right to know that the rights of the data subject have been duly respected. The use requests for data are already targeted when it comes to bulk data. There has to be a suspected terrorist that can only be searched. So only a fraction of SWIFT data will be transferred and only a very small proportion of that will be accessed. The rest will remain anonymous.  We will seek to reduce and explore the possibility of reducing and finetuning the definition in order to have the volume still further reduced, but there are already legally binding rules that would prevent any access to that data unless there is reasonable suspicion. The EU review team will verify a representative sample  as I said  and if there are any breaches of the agreement, it can be immediately interrupted by the European Union.  So I think that we can act swiftly and that we can have a good agreement. There is the security gap issue that we have to take into consideration but, of course, there are also many questions that have to be answered concerning data protection and the other issues that you have raised. The Americans have shown a very open attitude so far. They are ready to work with us as quickly as possible but also to be creative and to find answers to our questions. I know that a team from the European Parliament will travel next week and you will be able to put questions and hopefully have more answers then.  The other track in parallel to this is, of course, whether we should have another solution at European level, whether we should have an EU TFTP or create some new authority. That is a very important discussion. It needs to be explored in depth within Europe. Of course, that will not be part of the negotiation. We must make sure that, should this happen, the Americans will help and there will be reciprocity, but we must figure that out. The Commission is willing to participate, to be innovative and to put forward proposals, but that is for the Member States to decide. I know that the European Parliament is very active, and I am looking forward to having these discussions with you. So this is a parallel discussion.  Also in parallel, there is the work done by my colleague, VicePresident Viviane Reding, who is already starting to draft a mandate for a longterm data protection agreement for all the agreements that we have with the United States. Of course, this is also something that has to be put into the picture.  Finally, the volcano in Iceland is, of course, something that has created a lot of travel problems for many people all around the world and it makes it impossible for you to vote. I very much deplore that, but you can be sure that  the Presidency is here, I am here, our services are here  we have taken due account of the debate. We have seen the draft resolution and that is signed by four political groups. We will communicate that to the Ministers.  If we postpone the decision in the Council, we will lose two important weeks of negotiations. I said earlier that the Americans are willing. They are constructive and they want to embark on this, but it will not be easy. It will be a difficult negotiation and we need the time. We want to get this done as soon as possible but also as well as possible. If we want the European Parliament to be able to vote on it before the summer recess, we must take a decision so that we can start the negotiations as soon as possible. So please be understanding about this. I do want to reassure you that both the Presidency and the Commission have listened extremely carefully to your views and, as the Presidency said, we will take account of the debate here and communicate it to the Ministers on Friday.
5599486 author: Roger McNabb:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, honourable Members, my colleague, Commissioner Piebalgs excuses himself. Unfortunately, he cannot be here with you today, so he has entrusted me with the task of taking this debate with you. Thank you for this opportunity to explain the Commissions position on the use of cyanide for gold extraction in the European Union.  First, as the honourable Member knows, we have had a careful and very comprehensive study of the dramatic accident and the causes of it at Baia Mare in Romania in  2000  when a dam retaining toxic substances broke. The conclusions of that study were taken on board when the European Union adopted in  2006  a specific directive on the management of extracted waste.  The deadline for Member States to transpose this was only two years ago and it is still regarded as an uptodate, proportionate and appropriate approach to the risk of using cyanide.  The directive includes several requirements to improve the safety of extractive waste management facilities and limit their impact on the environment.  Explicit and precise requirements are set on the construction and the management of waste facilities which have to be operated using the best available technique concept.  A full accident prevention policy is required for the facilities in which toxic substances are treated or stored. Emergency plans to be used in case of accidents must be established, not only by the operator but also by the competent authorities. Clear information requirements are included in the directive if transboundary impacts are expected.  This legislation also incorporates requirements for the closure of extraction facilities, and for after closure. It includes the obligation to set up an underwritten financial guarantee for each installation before the beginning of the operation. The directive includes strict maximum limit values of cyanide concentration before this substance is stored in ponds for remaining residues to be broken down by oxidation, sunlight or bacteria.  In practice, in order to meet the strict limit values, it is necessary to install specific equipment destroying most of the cyanide before its storage in the pond.  To our best knowledge, unfortunately, no adequate alternatives to cyanide use for gold extraction exist on the market. In most European deposits, gold is bound with other metals meaning that a separation method is required. A total cyanide ban would imply stopping European extraction and consequently increase gold imports, often from countries with lower environmental and social standards.  Nevertheless, the Commission is following technology development in the sector and, if alternative techniques emerge in the coming years, the debate might very well be reopened.  In the meantime, a good implementation of this directive is essential to guarantee the safety of these facilities and minimise the risk associated with their management. Let me also point out that Member States are responsible for deciding on whether to open gold mines on their territories.  The Commissions role is to ensure full implementation of the directive and good implementation and enforcement is a priority.  Under the directive, the Member States are bound to provide the Commission with information on implementation no later than  2012  and we, in turn, are obliged to analyse and report on this basis.  That will obviously be the right time for us to assess the effectiveness of this approach and if, at that point, the current approach were found to be ineffective, we should not rule out the possibility of an outright ban.  In conclusion, I would like to insist on the importance of ensuring high wasterecycling rates and improved resource efficiency in the extraction sector. Even without considering the use of cyanide, mining for gold is far from kind to the environment.  To extract  1  g of gold, it is necessary to move and treat, on average,  5   000  kg of ore. The same amount can be obtained through the recycling of approximately  5  kg of old mobile phones. This example illustrates the importance of increasing the separate collection and recycling of waste  in this case, electronic and electrical waste which can contain gold and other similar precious metals. This is why resource efficiency is a priority for this Commission.
2095614 author: Roger Brown:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Coelho and Mr Alvaro for their contributions, and thank you for the very constructive cooperation we have had on this extremely complicated file that I inherited. It is very complicated, but I am determined to work together with you in order to get this right in a transparent way and to see the project completed.  The vote tomorrow is very timely for the SIS II project. The Council has confirmed that the Milestone I test was successful and that the development of SIS II should continue on the basis of current technical solutions.  The legislative proposals before you contained three substantial elements: Mr Coelho made reference to them, and that will change the development of the project. First, as Mr Coelho said, the initial expiry date of the instruments   30  June this year  has become unrealistic and will therefore be changed. This will allow the SIS II project to continue in the light of technical requirements and a global schedule which are currently being redefined with the Member States experts. It will be available for the Council on  3  and  4  June.  The rapporteur calls for a specific deadline for SIS II development. I am sorry to tell you that the Commission is not yet in a position to take up that proposal. The Commissions experts, together with all Member States, are in the process of finalising the adaptation of requirements and the new global schedule. Once this is done, the Commission will make appropriate suggestions in the light of the new global schedule to be presented at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council in two weeks.  Secondly, the Global Programme Management Board is a group of technical experts advising on SIS II development and that should be formalised. The global management board has already proven to be a very good tool of cooperation and technical analysis between the Commission and Member State experts. The proposal will make sure that this will continue whilst streamlining the boards role, composition and procedures. For this reason  it is a purely technical body  it is not appropriate to open the board to MEPs and other parliamentary officials. We will continue to move forward on SIS II in a transparent way with the European Parliament, but we must keep a clear distinction between the technical work and political transparency. But in this spirit, the Commission is open to providing full technical information to the Members of this House by making available the reports of the board to Parliament, in line with what Mr Coelho suggests.  Thirdly, the necessary legal flexibility to carry out the development through an alternative technical scenario would be foreseen and I believe that we all agree on the rationale of this.  As regards the budgetary aspects of continuing SIS II development, the Commission shares the rapporteurs aim to make the most efficient use of taxpayers money. In this context, the report asks to reserve Parliaments right to put funds for SIS II development for  2011  in the budgetary reserve. This is, of course, entirely within the discretion of the budgetary authority. From the point of view of budgetary implementation, I would only ask Mr Alvaro if there could be some sort of clear and efficient deblocking procedure for the case when we would need the money. I would like to thank the LIBE committee, Mr Coelho and the Budgetary Control Committee rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, for their excellent cooperation on this file.  I am sorry that Mr Tavares is not yet here. We would have had an opportunity to discuss the EU resettlement programme  an extremely important subject  with him. As you know, a large majority of refugees worldwide are hosted in countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Many of these refugees find themselves in Catch 22  situations: they cannot return to their country of origin, nor can they integrate locally in the country of first asylum, since many of these countries are themselves victims of conflict or poverty. For these groups of refugees, resettlement can be the only solution.  Through resettlement, the Member States of the European Union can demonstrate tangible solidarity with these often overburdened countries of first asylum, at the same time protecting some of the most vulnerable refugees under sustainable and humane conditions. Today, resettlement is carried out, but there is no structural coordination at EU level. The Commission believes that the EU can play a bigger part and be more active on resettlement by strengthening the Unions role globally and showing solidarity with the most affected regions. The proposal tabled in September  2009  aims to improve the situation. We are very satisfied by the very positive response that Parliament and the Council have given to the proposal. I would particularly like to thank Mr Tavares for his sterling work on this, and I welcome the strong political consensus among the different groups on this matter.  The idea in the proposal is that the EU, in partnership with the UNHCR, will contribute to more strategic use of resettlement on the basis of an annual decision on the common priorities for resettlement. By pooling the national quotas, the EU can help to alleviate some of the most difficult conflicts in the world and in refugee situations. The programme leaves to each Member State the final choice as regards the number of refugees to be resettled, although it will enable them to coordinate and mutualise experiences and best practices. Through the annual exercise, the EU will be able to be more reactive to evolving challenges and global refugee needs in order to render more efficient the Member States use of the European Refugee Fund. The programme will also help in a more targeted and practical cooperation project through the Asylum Support Office, working with both national administrations and civil society organisations. I fully support the rapporteurs idea of creating a specialised unit in the office to be established in Malta.  The Joint EU resettlement programme is being discussed at a crucial time: since  2007 , five Member States  in addition to those which already had the programmes  have decided to start national resettlement programmes. Several other Member States have resettled Iraqi refugees over the past year in response to a commitment agreed at EU level in  2008 . It is crucial that we maintain this positive momentum and that the adoption of the proposal is not delayed.  We regret, however, that certain divergences and procedural issues are hampering the rapid adoption of this proposal. This proposal is of great political significance. The Commissions decision to establish annual priorities for resettlement is an implementing decision, and forms part of the financial management of the European Refugee Fund. With respect to the delegated acts procedures, we are concerned that the procedure would be considerably delayed, making management of the fund very difficult.  This is a first step towards a common approach; there will, of course, be a review of the experience, and there are plans to bring forward more ambitious initiatives as part of the Stockholm Programme.
9127630 author: Nancy Cameron:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Madam President, I agree with all the speakers and with all those Members who have been working on the subject. The accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights is a step of constitutional importance. It will complete the system of protection of fundamental rights within the Union, and you know perfectly well that the Lisbon Treaty does not make this an option but a destination.  I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament takes such a great interest in this file  and has from the very beginning, by the way  which is evidenced by the resolution which Parliament has put on the table.  In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the Committee on Constitutional Rights and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their excellent cooperation on the file. I would like to thank them for the hearing which was organised and which was of real help and great use in bringing this file forward.  The draft report presented by Mr Juregui Atondo is, to a very large extent, in line with the position of the Commission. Let me just mention three points which, in my view, are very important.  Firstly, the Commission shares the position that accession by the EU to the additional protocols of the European Convention  which, by the way, have not been ratified by all Member States  is also very desirable. Indeed, many of these protocols are of potential relevance as regards the exercise of the Unions powers, and certain guarantees enshrined in these protocols are also reflected in the Charter. The negotiation directives should therefore mandate the Commission to negotiate a provision ensuring that the Union may accede to any of the additional protocols.  The decision then to which protocols we will de facto accede, on top of the convention itself, will have to be taken unanimously by the Council after obtaining the consent of Parliament. In the Commissions view, such decisions should preferably encompass all additional protocols and should be taken together with the decision concluding the accession agreement itself.  Secondly, it is important to deal with the specific situation of the Union as a distinct legal entity vested with autonomous powers that is going to become a contracting Party to a mechanism initially designed for States only. Therefore, a number of limited and technical procedural adaptations to the convention are necessary with regard to the specific nature of Union law.  Among those is the socalled corespondent mechanism to take account of the decentralised implementation of Union law by Member States. By that mechanism, the Union will receive the right to join the proceedings as a corespondent in cases brought against Member States when Union law is at stake. I am glad to see that Parliaments report also argues in favour of this.  Thirdly, I fully subscribe to the report which recommends participation by representatives of the Union in the bodies of the convention on an equal footing with those of the contracting parties. Such participation is indeed a key element in the smooth integration and insertion of the Union into the system of the convention. You have understood this now to mean, in particular, the presence in the Strasbourg Court of a judge elected from each contracting party.  The Commission is therefore strongly in favour of having a permanent fulltime judge elected for the Union, who enjoys the same status and has the same duties as his peers. An ad hoc judge, who would intervene only in cases brought against the Union or involving Union law, would, in our opinion, not be sufficient.  As for the method of electing a Union judge, the normal procedure provided for in the convention should apply.  This means that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council will elect a judge from a proposal for three candidates presented by the European Union, and I agree with the draft report that an appropriate number of Members of Parliament should be allowed to participate in sessions of the Assembly when it elects the judges of the European Court.  The procedure for drawing up the list of the three candidates is not a matter for the accession agreement: it is a matter for us. We have to do this by internal legal rules, and the idea that Parliament should be involved in a way similar to that provided for by Article  255  regarding the selection of candidates for the Court of Justice is a very interesting one which deserves close examination.  Honourable Members, the Spanish Presidency attaches very high priority to this dossier, as you know, and the Spanish Presidency would like to reach an agreement before the end of June. If the Council could reach an agreement by then  which I hope it will  this will allow us to then start accession negotiations after summer. As I already said two weeks ago in Brussels, I will ensure that the Commission  as the Unions negotiator  keeps Parliament fully informed throughout the negotiation process.  This all relates to European affairs, but we also have the question of international human rights on the agenda. As you know,  138  states took a step forward in  1998  when they adopted the Rome Statute creating, for the first time in history, a permanent international court to ensure that perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are brought to account. The Court started to operate in  2003  and now, seven years later, we have the review conference in Kampala, which invites us to conduct an early analysis of the Courts activities, of the challenges that lie ahead and of the effectiveness of EU support.  As regards the activities of the Court, we know that the Court is fully operational, but is still in its infancy. No judicial cycle has been completed, but the ICC is considering the situation in five countries: one trial has started, another trial is going to start on  5  July and one further case is in the pretrial stage  all for DAR and DRC.  Let us not forget that this is only a court of last resort, so the primary responsibility lies with the states themselves. In most cases, the Court acts as a catalyst for states to investigate and prosecute cases before national courts. At the same time, in its short life, the Court has been a powerful deterrent for future atrocities because perpetrators now know that justice will prevail and, in this sense, the Court faces challenges.  The ratification by Bangladesh brought the number of State Parties to the Rome Statute to  111 . However, it is very clear that we have to go for universal acceptance of the Statute and of the Court. The Court needs the participation and the cooperation of all State Parties and nonParties, as well as international and regional organisations. The Court cannot perform its functions without the states arresting those for whom an arrest warrant has been issued by the ICC; nor if the witnesses cannot be protected; nor if there are no prisons for those who have been condemned, and that is why the EU supported the Court over the last ten years to help solve these problems.  We, as the EU, have, from the outset, been staunch supporters of the establishment of the Court as an essential mechanism in the new international order designed to end impunity which, as you know, has seen millions of people in recent history subjected to crimes but only a handful of those responsible brought to justice.  The EU considers that an effective ICC is an indispensable instrument for the international community to combat this impunity and to promote a rulebased international order. That is why we have been supporting the Court using the various instruments at our disposal that the Minister has already mentioned. The common position was translated into an action plan. We were the first organisation to enter into a cooperation and assistance agreement with the Court in  2006 , and we give the ICC full political and diplomatic support with dmarches, political dialogues and statements. The inclusion of ICC clauses in international agreements is now standard practice for the European Union.  Since  2000 , the European Initiative  later entitled the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights  has contributed EUR  29  million to support the Court directly or indirectly, notably through global civil society campaigns. The EU has also adopted several decisions in the justice, freedom and security area with a view to strengthening cooperation among Member States in the investigation and prosecution of Rome Statute crimes at national level, so we do our best in order to advance the system. The system needs further perfection, but it needs strong engagement by all nations around the globe for this to happen.
10121207 author: Michael LaCourt:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on Human Rights are extraordinary texts. They are the basis of the values on which we have been building our society and our European Union. I think they are much too important and much too historical to give way to party political polemics. I must say that I am very proud indeed that, at this moment in the construction of the European Union, we can go ahead by putting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice and by acceding to the Convention on Human Rights.  When I hear what your rapporteur, Diego Lpez Garrido, and your corapporteurs, Cristian Dan Preda and Kinga Gl, have said in your name in this Parliament, I know that you are also very conscious about the historical task which is now in our hands. The added value of the accession has been very well explained in those texts and in the contributions of many of the Members.  The Member States have all signed up to the Convention but they have also  as the MinisterinOffice of the Council just explained  transferred substantial competences to the European Union. It is therefore normal that the European Union, when it acts as a European Union, will be subject to the same external control of the specialised Court on Human Rights as are the Member States.  To give one very concrete example, there could be a decision of the European Commission against an industry in the area of competition law which could be potentially challenged directly before the Court in Strasbourg, which is something that is difficult to do today. As you have already pointed out, there will be a lot of very concrete examples: concrete examples which will help the citizens because  and this is something new  they will now have a double guarantee. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg will judge on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which, by the way, is binding for all Member States. That should be clearly stated once and for all.  I cannot understand how somebody who has an elected mandate and has been elected by citizens can call into question the rights of those citizens. It is better for citizens to have twice the rights than to have zero rights. Here, we are giving them twice the rights, and that is what Europe is about. Europe is about rights for European citizens and I am very proud that this House is standing for those rights. Yes, we will now have the bills of rights where the citizens will know that they can go to the courts in order to have their rights taken seriously.  The question of whether or not we shall now be part of the Convention on Human Rights is not a question anymore because Article  6  of the treaty obliges the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. So I do not think we should discuss this any further because that is simply done.  We should also know that this accession will leave the position of the individual Member States, visvis the convention, completely unaffected as long as there is no European law at stake. This will continue to be the case. The individual relationship between a Member State and the convention will stay exactly the same as it is. Now there will be supplementary guarantees concerning the EU law.  Of course the issue of the risk of conflicting jurisprudence has to be analysed. It is being analysed and I am grateful to the rapporteur who has taken this issue on board. We have so far seen that these conflicts are considered to be minimal because the convention is already part of the norms which the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg takes into account today and the convention will operate as a minimum standard. The Commission expects caselaw of Strasbourg and of Luxembourg to develop harmoniously and converge in the coming years.  I now move to more specific questions.  On litigation: that is not an issue for the European Court of Human Rights or of the European Court of Justice. For the moment, that is an issue for the British system of litigation, and I have already started to discuss this with the British Government to see if they could review this system of litigation, which can, in certain cases, when it comes to the freedom of the press for instance, become very harmful indeed.  The European Parliament has so far, under the leadership of its rapporteurs, done very good work. I count on Parliament to continue to participate in a process which will certainly be a difficult process, a long process, where we have to solve the technical problems  and technical problems can become very political indeed  so I count on Parliament to continue to participate in this very difficult task.  As for relations between the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I leave that in the hands of Parliament. If you need a helping hand, I will be there to help you in that respect, but it is a matter for the parliamentarians themselves to see that they find a common ground and I believe that it should not be that difficult.  Concerning the ICC, this Parliament has already received the Prosecutor, Mr MorenoOcampo, and the President of the Court, Mr Song. I think this was a very strong political signal from the European Parliament that Parliament is taking seriously human rights, not only within Europe, but also outside Europe.  We also believe that the Kampala conference is the most important international conference devoted to international justice in a decade. We have to make it count. There again, I count on Parliament also because I know that Members will be present and will be speaking up in Kampala.  We know that the EU has played and will play an important role by integrating the outcomes of the conference into its policies on international justice, on its assistance to third states and, most of all, into all the negotiations which will take place in the coming months and years. In particular, we will continue to support national capacity building in order to strengthen and enable national jurisdictions to conduct credible and effective national investigations and trials of Rome Statute crimes.  Our policy in this respect remains unchanged and undiminished, but we now have a new tool, and the new tool is the Lisbon Treaty, which gives us a new capacity to be more consistent and more effective in our support to the Court. In line with the encouragement by Parliament and expressed in the resolution and during the debate, the High RepresentativeVicePresident and her services will continue resolutely to promote universal accession to the Rome Statute. We will do that systematically in all our discussions with partners outside of Europe.  There were two very specific questions which I would like to answer briefly.  The first was whether an arrest warrant against President alBashir is a part of the solution or part of the problem. The Commission clearly sees this as part of a longterm solution because this arrest warrant shows that, with the establishment of the Court, justice has become imminent. Whoever the person is, even if this person is a Head of State, and even if this arrest warrant is not immediately enforced, it will not disappear because the ICC is a permanent court, so let me assure you that the EU will continue to call on Sudan to cooperate fully with the Court.  On the question of whether the Commission will present amendments in the Kampala meeting, here the answer is no because the EU, as such, is not a party  it is the Member States who will negotiate the amendments. However, the Commission will play an active role in the stocktaking part of the conference, and we count fully on the Spanish Presidency to lead the European nations so that their voice will make a big difference in this conference.
4073998 author: Lynne Merx:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Madam President, everybody is talking about the Stockholm Programme. That is a Christmas tree with several hundred wishes. I would like everybody to speak about the reality. How were these Christmas tree wishes treated before the Lisbon Treaty? Behind closed doors, without much consideration for the citizens and what they want, wish for and expect; in the third pillar, where ministers of the interior were asking neither the European Parliament nor the Commission, and where the European Court of Justice had no possibility to intervene.  That is where we are starting from: an impossible situation. Where de minimis decisions were not even carried out at national level, where citizens did not have the means or the instruments to go to court, to protest and to seek justice.  Fortunately, we now have the Lisbon Treaty. There is no third pillar any more. There are Commission proposals, codecision, implementation at Member State level, control by the European Court of Justice, but that means also that things cannot be done instantly any more. Rules and proposals have to follow the normal way, under which you parliamentarians have asked the Commission to conduct its work.  First, a thorough analysis of what is feasible, what is good, what has added value. Second, public consultation, in order to know whether the ideas that we put on the table will be accepted or not by civil society, by industry, by the Member States, by the national parliaments, which are now a player in all these questions and which conduct the subsidiarity test. And then, impact assessments, in order to see if what we are doing is the right way. And, only then, we have the definite proposal from the Commission.  If you want the Commission to continue to do as has been done over the last number of years, just tell me, and I will come with a proposal every week. And do you know what will happen with those proposals? They will first be blocked in the national parliaments, and rightly so, because we have to come with serious proposals based on the legal assumptions that what we are doing is strong, is feasible and can be implemented in the Member States.  I do not want the first proposal we make to be challenged before the Court of Justice and before the Court of Human Rights. I would like to lead all of us to the way where the citizens will understand that the added value of what we are doing here is of real benefit to them in practical terms. Yes, as the Commissioner responsible for womens affairs, I have heard this Parliament discussing what we need to do, most of all in order to give legal certainty to women in all our Member States, that when they have a problem of violence, they will get justice and not the illusion that they hope they will get justice and then they get nowhere and end up with nothing. So here we really have to work together.  There are hundreds of measures which have to be Lisbonised, which have to be taken out of the hole and brought into the light of day, which have to be adapted to the real rules of law  hundreds of measures that do not work.  The arrest warrant: Ms Ludford was just speaking about this. Of course it is not carried out in the Member States because the construction around the mutual recognition and the mutual trust, which is at the basis of the mutual recognition, has not been built up. Colleagues, you cannot do all this without having mutual trust. I am sorry, I cannot by decree insert mutual trust in the heads of the judges all over Europe!  We have to build this mutual trust with the legislation and with the measures to boost the rights of citizens in all our Member States, so that the judges also implement the rules we have been looking for and, yes, we are advancing very quickly on this.  An action plan, well, the colleague is not there any more, but an action plan for combating the violence against women. In  2011 , a comprehensive text about protecting the victims, all kinds of victims  for me there is not a victim here, a victim there and a third category of victims  all kinds of victims have to be considered.  Yes, we have been working on data protection; when fortunately you, Parliament, said no to the way things have been working before Lisbon was implemented. We will not continue like this any more and, yes, Chairman of the committee, you know that your committee and the other committees are fully integrated in the way we are preceding.  We will have many things to do together: very technical questions, which will have a very important impact on our society. We will have to do something; we will have to explain to the citizens what we are doing. Because that is also a part of the whole thing and it is not the easiest part of the whole issue.  Yes, we have to take measures, for instance, on illegal immigration and asylum and, as you have seen, my colleague, Cecilia Malmstrm, has very concrete proposals on illegal immigration, on border controls, on legal migration. Yes, it would be important if the Parliament could, together with the Council, adopt the existing proposals, the asylum package, the simple permit proposal, the joint resettlement programme, the mutual recognition and the just adopted action plan for unaccompanied minors. There is an awful lot in the pipeline.  It is not about who is going to do what because certain things you simply cannot do. Here is an example: you asked for the AntiDiscrimination Directive. The AntiDiscrimination Directive, I am sorry to say, is a question that has to be solved by unanimity and it is blocked in the Council. So what do you want me to do  not me, because it was before my time  the Commission has put antidiscrimination on the table, unanimity is blocked in the Council? So speak to the Council; speak with those who are blocking it.  Samesex couples: well you know perfectly well that it is the prerogative of subsidiarity, the competence of Member States to regulate the way they treat samesex couples. Where the European Union comes in is the crossborder treatment of these samesex couples. But I cannot do the work for France, for Italy, for Poland, for Romania, for Greece and for Luxembourg; that has to be done by those Member States alone. I can see there is no discrimination if those people, from wherever they come, are exercising their rights to crossborder mobility, and that is what we are going to do.  We have started already to see that, in terms of mobility, in terms of citizens rights, in terms of collaboration between the legal systems, in terms of eliminating the borders that still exist in this single market, which, sorry to say, is not a single market when it comes to citizens. That is why I am very happy; I have read the report by Mario Monti. There are many elements in this report, which say where we have to move. You know what is my bible? The report, which was drawn up by one of your Members, contains all the elements on the free movement of citizens and all the problems that have to be solved.  Now what I propose to you is to take them, one by one, and solve them, one by one, in full cooperation with you. When I put on the table a proposal, and you have seen how it goes, you will have so many proposals that you will have to work at night  I do not know if it is permitted under employment rules and human rights, but I will not care for your human rights as Members of Parliament. We will work until we have solved these problems  there are hundreds of problems to be solved and I cannot do it alone. I need your very constructive help. I know I will get this help but help me to work on one element after the other, even if it has to be one element per week. It is going to be on your table. I am willing to come to your committees as often as you call me, Madam President, and we will discuss this over, element by element. In five years time, with your help, we will have changed this continent.
8613904 author: Christoph Finlayson:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, the question put forward by the honourable Members falls into three parts. The first: whether the Commission is of the opinion that there should be one single definition of social housing in the EU. The second: the question on the principles of subsidiarity and universality. The third: a question of income limits for access to social housing. Before replying to these questions, I would like to underline that the Commission attaches great importance to social housing. Social housing is a key tool for active social and economic inclusion policies in the European Union.  In reply to questions  1  and  2 , I would like to be very clear. The Commission imposes no single definition of social housing at EU level and fully respects the principle of subsidiarity. The honourable Members rightly refer to the Commissions  2005  decision on State aid for services of general economic interest. This decision provides legal certainty in the provision of the services and reduces the administrative burden on the public authorities which finance them.  According to this decision, aid to social housing which meets the conditions set by the decision receives preferential treatment, as it is exempted from notification  irrespective of the amounts involved. According to this decision, that exemption applies when social housing is qualified as a service of general economic interest by the Member State concerned. It is for each Member State to define the scope of social housing in line with its traditions, culture and state intervention.  I would also like to refer to the Commission communications of  2006  and  2007 , which clearly highlighted the Member States responsibility and wide discretion as regards social services of general interest. Furthermore, this point was emphasised more recently in the Protocol on Services of General Interest. However, as the term social housing suggests, what is involved here is not housing in general, but housing provided on the basis of social criteria.  This is why the recitals in the  2005  decision refer to housing for disadvantaged citizens or socially less advantaged groups which, due to solvency constraints, are unable to obtain housing at market conditions. The Member States must therefore define a target group for social housing to allow social housing to be allocated in a transparent way and to prevent those most in need from being excluded.  The Member States have wide scope for manoeuvre in determining the size of the target group and in applying the social housing systems. The Commissions role is limited to checking that there is no manifest error in the definition.  This approach was confirmed in a Commission decision adopted in December  2009  on social housing in the Netherlands. This approach is also fully in line with Article  34  of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which refers to social and housing assistance for all those who lack sufficient resources.  A clear definition of social housing also ensures that State aid cannot be channelled into financing commercial activities outside the scope of services of general economic interest.  Question  2  also refers to a universal right to housing. However, as I have already said, housing in general is not the same as social housing. Clearcut, transparent eligibility and allocation criteria for social housing are in the interest of the beneficiaries and ensure the proper use of public funds.  In reply to question  3 , in which the honourable Members ask why access to social housing is limited to households with an income of less than EUR  33   000 , I would like, here again, to be very clear. There is no income limit set at EU level for access to social housing.  This amount concerns one Member State  the Netherlands. It was part of the changes introduced by the Dutch authorities to bring the national social housing system in line with the European State aid rules. The Dutch authorities set such a limit to identify the target group for social housing in the Netherlands. The Commission did not identify any errors with that definition of social housing and therefore approved the Dutch State aid scheme. I would add that the target group defined by the Dutch authorities is very wide and covers  43  of the Dutch population.
4598348 author: Annette Brown:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, I fully agree that we have to look at this question in a wider context, in this case, in the context of the financial and economic crisis. In the last two years, we saw that this was a test of competition policies no matter whether it concerned the financial sector, the automotive sector or, in this case, the housing sector, and it was also a test of our social policies, whether it concerned children or the elderly or the homeless.  In this set of questions which I received, these two issues  competition and social policies  overlap. That is why it is even more complex than it would be outside the context of the crisis.  The crisis demonstrated an enormous market failure, not only in the financial sector but also in the housing sector, and it became very clear that market forces alone cannot resolve these problems, not only for the extremely poor, but also for larger groups of society. That is why I would be strictly against any principle that would restrict the concept of social housing to only the poorest groups in society, especially with respect to the diversity of European countries and the principle of subsidiarity. I would certainly insist on leaving the definitions in this context to the Member States themselves as I have said already in my introductory speech.  Going back to the Dutch case, which has been the focus of the discussion, I would like to repeat that the Commission is not imposing the criteria that have been set in the Dutch context to any other country. In full respect of subsidiarity, it is for the Member States to decide the actual conditionality of social housing.  This is confirmed by the decision concerning the Dutch State aid scheme, and I would like to recall that the limits set by the Dutch authorities  which apply only in the Netherlands  cover  43  of the Dutch population, which is certainly well beyond the poorest groups. The Dutch decision, moreover, has confirmed that the social mix and social cohesion are valid public policy objectives for which State aid may be justified, and not only for those living in extreme poverty or at risk of poverty.  I think the social distress in this over the last few years has destabilised society on a much wider scale, and that is why we have to be sensitive to this. I would also need to add that the Commission only verifies aid given to housing companies. Any subsidy given directly to citizens is not subject to State aid rules.  The discussion also touched upon a wider context, which is social services of general interest. That is why I need to address this as well and emphasise that beyond housing, other services of general interest and, in particular, other social services play a preventive and socially cohesive role which is targeted at the whole population independently of wealth or income. The Commission made this point clear in its  2007  communication when it highlighted the objectives and principles of organisation of social services.  The Commission is committed to promoting the quality of social services. For instance, we support the development of a quality framework for social services of general interest within the Social Protection Committee.  A few final thoughts in closing my answer. Since some of the questions concerned a longer timescale, spanning into the next financial perspective, I would agree that, in a variety of contexts, housing will be affected; indeed, refurbishment in the context of energy efficiency  which, from our point of view, falls under the category of green jobs  will certainly be an area where we will have activity, without, of course, trying to have a common European housing policy.  There will also be other issues like housing for the most vulnerable groups of society such as the Roma, where there is already a beginning, and I think there will be continued support from the Structural Funds to address housing issues, in this particular case, for the extremely vulnerable marginalised groups in a variety of Member States. This also highlights the importance of having a very diversified view because countries are different in terms of their social needs, and certain decisions and solutions that are applied in highincome countries certainly do not necessarily have to be followed  and definitely not imposed  in other Member States.
8800365 author: Philip Bush:  author.  Madam President, Mr Simpson apologises for not being present during the discussion on the ash cloud crisis. Ironically, in view of this evenings discussion, he has been caught up in the flight restrictions related to the ash cloud restrictions in the UK and therefore has been unable to travel to Strasbourg for the discussion. I will therefore be speaking on his behalf this evening.  The oral question on the volcanic ash crisis is just as relevant today, in the context of the ongoing disruption to airspace, as it was at the time of the initial eruption of the Icelandic volcano last month, when we saw much of EU airspace closed for six days. We are now dealing not only with the aftermath of that disruption and its financial impact but also with the present ongoing uncertainty of continued and prolonged disruption to European airspace.  While I believe that some important lessons have been learned and acted on following the unprecedented scale, duration and cause of the initial airspace shutdown, it is clear that the response at European level needs to be stepped up a gear in the face of ongoing disruptions.  Faced with the challenges that the unprecedented nature and unspecified duration and the disruption is causing to air travel, I am concerned today to get assurances that the mechanisms we have in place for coping with the disruption are working effectively and that, where gaps have been identified over the last few weeks, these are being adequately addressed.  I am pleased to say that the Air Passengers Rights Regulation has proved vitally important in providing a safety net to ensure that it is not the passengers who bear the brunt of the financial consequences of the disruption and who are not left stranded by the chaos. The airspace closure has, however, raised important questions about airlines fulfilling their obligations when it comes to air passengers rights, especially in the light of any compensation afforded to the aviation industry.  What feedback is the Commission getting on the treatment of passengers, and what assurances can it give that airlines are fulfilling their obligations in line with the legislation? Furthermore, the current situation has exposed the vulnerability of those passengers booked on thirdcountry airlines for whom the air passengers rights legislation does not apply. How does the Commission propose to address this gap in the legislation?  We also  very early on in this crisis  recognised the heavy financial losses suffered by the aviation industry during the airspace shutdown. My concern with any compensation package made available to the aviation industry is to ensure that compensation is directed at the different sectors of the aviation industry  not just the airlines  and that the compensation measures are of an EUwide nature.  I know that some Member States will be more sympathetic than others when it comes to giving financial aid to their airlines. What assurances is the Commission able to give that some conditions will be levelled to avoid any distortions in the compensation handed out at Member State level and to ensure a level playing field?  I now turn to the most pressing concern today, which is over the procedures in place for defining noflight zones in the EU. The continued disruption to European airspace has once again put the procedures applied for defining noflight zones under the spotlight. There are concerns that Member States are being over cautious in their implementation of noflight zones and that aeroplanes are safe to fly amid higher densities of ash than are currently allowed by EU rules.  The ongoing closure and opening of airspace by Member States over the last few weeks has very much highlighted the need for a more joinedup approach at EU level, rather than the differentiated approach we are currently seeing. I am also aware that the Commission has put renewed emphasis on improving data collection and modelling methodologies to give a more detailed picture of the risks involved for aeroplanes flying through an ash cloud.  How does the new information we have impact on the restrictions currently in place and the definition of the noflight zones?  Finally, we have seen the value of increased European coordination when it comes to responding to the ash cloud crisis. Further areas where we have recognised the importance of greater cooperation include the acceleration of the Single European Sky initiative and the creation of a mobility action plan to help the EU cope better during such crises.
6357386 author: Claire Brown:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Madam President, honourable Members, thank you very much for the many interesting and detailed comments on this ash problem. I only had three minutes at the beginning. Now I can elaborate at least  10  times more on all these issues, but I will be brief  do not worry  or at least not too long.  I can only say that it has really been a very exciting and extraordinary period, and it is back again. It is clear that volcanoes continue to erupt as this Icelandic volcano is doing. This is all part of life for the aviation industry, but it is not only volcanoes but also thunderstorms, snow and such occurrences which all disrupt aviation. This is a part of this business, we must be very clear about that. Nobody alone can be responsible for this risk  no airlines, no governments, no European Union. I must also say that so far, the European Union has no jurisdiction at all in regulating air traffic. It has been intergovernmental bodies that have been dealing with this so far, as well as national authorities.  To exclude, prevent or foresee everything which can happen in aviation is impossible. The risks must be shared and clients who decide to use aviation services must be prepared  as we must all be  for some delay if, for example, the runway at Brussels airport is not cleared of snow or some other thing.  Regarding the criticism that we acted late and regarding who in fact acted: I was there in Eurocontrol; the risk from ash is a real risk, and we cannot hold out for the possibility that we will finally find scientific solutions concerning what size of particle would be considered dangerous for engines, because nobody wants to give this assessment. We can determine particle size and we can assess the cloud, but nobody wants to give an assessment and to say that this ash is no longer dangerous for the engines. This will be a very complicated thing. The decision to close airspace was taken strictly in accordance with the existing rules and with all relevant institutions who were responsible for this. To those who ask who is now responsible for the closure of airspace, I would ask them who would be responsible if the airspace had not been closed and something had happened.  When Eurocontrol sought to find some different approaches to the ash cloud, it was not an easy decision or easy discussion because it was a matter of deciding to take enormous responsibility for the safety of aviation. The safety of planes and lives must come first. I think it was done reasonably fast under these circumstances because the volcano was, and continues to be, very exceptional and extraordinary.  Regarding the future, the key issue mentioned by somebody is what about Indonesia, what about the United States? There is a responsibility, which mainly rests with the pilots. In Europe today, pilots tend to reject this kind of new responsibility. European air traffic is very busy and there must be some kind of combination between greater flexibility and clear data about the possible threats and possible risks. I do not know about Indonesia, but in the United States, the system is very simple: it is the pilot who decides how to circumvent the ash and I must say that this works very well. But in Europe, we must obviously first create some common approach to the methodology of possible assessment of risk.  Regarding passengers, I must say that we have always consistently and forcefully stated from the Commission side that passenger rights legislation must be complied with. This is a very clear message. Again, the enforcement of this legislation is in the hands of Member States but I understand that most airlines and most Member States also have taken this very seriously. There are different examples and, of course, in the aftermath, there will be exposure to negative examples as well, but mostly they have been taken seriously, and we are planning a revision of passenger rights. We will definitely then assess what to do with the attempts to abuse passenger rights and excessive interpretations of passenger rights. In general, the passenger rights legislation has worked very well and the logic must be there. Passenger rights stipulate that passengers must be provided with information, with care and with rerouting or reimbursement under these extraordinary circumstances, not compensation. This is a different word.  There is a huge programme under way with the Single Sky initiative in order to streamline air traffic management, and I cannot complain about the cooperation between Member States during this particular period. The Transport Council was very cooperative and made many decisions which probably, under other circumstances, would have taken much longer. I really cannot say that we had bad cooperation with Member States in preparing and handling this extraordinary Transport Council.  Regarding finance and financial consequences, its rules are very simple and they are very clearly described in our paper prepared by three Commissioners  Rehn, Almunia and myself. This is State aid, and State aid can be given if Member States consider that there are enough reasons to give State aid to an airline which is in trouble, because passenger rights and all these costs must be borne by the airline. If the airline is in trouble and if a Member State considers that this is really a very bad situation, then State aid can be given, but, before State aid is given, a very careful assessment must be made not to create distortions and unfair advantages in the market. This was the main concern of airlines as well, and a fair approach to everybody is also the Commissions concern; our competition department will definitely look very carefully at all possible State aid cases.  So far, I do not know if anybody has applied for State aid in this particular area because, as I said at the beginning, airlines have contingency plans.  Somebody mentioned that they should have insurance. I asked them as well about the insurance. Insurance is more or less impossible because you cannot describe the product, or you can describe the product but it will be so expensive that it is not affordable. They have contingency plans on how to deal with extraordinary circumstances which disrupt the schedules. Of course, as an economist, I can see that there is a lot of room for different fantasies, what to calculate under the losses and what is a real number. It is a huge work to define the exact consequences of this volcanic ash which can be presented as a claim.  Regarding alternative transport, we will, of course, push ahead. We will have a TENT meeting soon where the Commission will push ahead for the development of a network of other modes of transport. I asked railways what is possible and what they actually did during this crisis, and they sent a lot of interesting information. There were additional trains, but the information about availability, timetables and other things remain, so far, very poor. One of our biggest priorities for the near future will be to have better information about all these possibilities.  Again, if there is a crisis in aviation, then bringing passengers home or taking them to destinations will still mainly be in the hands of airlines. It is at the planning stages that it is very important to also consider other modes and indeed other engines. This is another interesting story. There are lessons to be learned, and we are learning these lessons, and we will push forward with many plans and measures to create more streamlined air traffic management in Europe.  I must stress that volcanoes do not obey any rules, and we cannot exclude possible extraordinary events. There will always be some risk which must be taken into account, and such a risk must be part of planning our activities.
5758001 author: Helen Whittacker:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, I welcome this debate on the crisis response of the European Union and on the immediate and longerterm challenges of economic governance we are facing. I shall start with the immediate challenges and the crisis response.  Ten days ago, the European Union took bold and necessary decisions to safeguard financial stability in Europe. It was a dual response to the aggravated crisis, which had turned into a systemic challenge to the euro. It was a response that I would call a consolidation pact.  First, we agreed on a European financial stability mechanism that provides a financial backstop for up to EUR  500  billion, which will be supplemented by IMF funding at a ratio of  2 : 1 . Secondly, we agreed to accelerate fiscal consolidation in those Member States where it is most urgently needed.  With these decisions, Europe came up with a credible package that shows our citizens, the markets and the wider world that we will defend the euro  our common currency  whatever it takes.  We are not doing it for the sake of the mystical market forces but for the sake of sustainable growth and job creation in Europe, by ensuring that the threats to financial stability will not kill the economic recovery that is now in progress  though this is still rather modest and fragile. This is our responsibility in relation to our citizens, and we are delivering in very concrete terms. Yesterday, coordinating and managing on behalf of the euro area Member States, the Commission delivered EUR  14 . 5  billion for Greece, which the IMF has complemented with EUR  5 . 5  billion. We said we would be ready to meet the immediate needs of refinancing, and we delivered on time.  Of course, this is all conditional on a full and complete implementation of the programme designed, together with the Greek Government, by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB and the IMF.  The European Central Bank has also taken extraordinary measures to tackle the attacks we have recently seen on the euro. Beyond that, our Member States have understood the paramount importance of fiscal consolidation to ensure the sustainability of public finances and thus, preconditions for sustainable economic growth.  Last week, Spain and Portugal presented significant new fiscal consolidation measures which are important and difficult but, at the same time, are necessary steps in order to reduce the ballooning public deficits in  2010  and  2011 . The Commission will present a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy of the new targets and measures in the course of the next two weeks.  Let me underline that a faster reduction of the public deficit is indeed an essential component of the financial stability package that was agreed on  10  May by Ecofin. It is equally important that both countries adopt structural reforms that will contribute to increased potential growth, especially reforms of the labour markets and pension systems.  While accelerated fiscal consolidation is an immediate priority throughout Europe, at the same time, we need to coordinate our economic and fiscal policies by applying differentiation among the Member States. In other words, the efforts of fiscal consideration need to be differentiated according to fiscal space and economic vulnerability.  Countries with little or no fiscal space will need to frontload and accelerate measures, while others with better fiscal space should maintain their less restrictive fiscal policy stances for the sake of growth and jobs in Europe.  Of course, it would be a mistake to stop our efforts here. Let us recall that the first  10  years of the euro have been a success story: that is the starting point. But the crisis has shown that we need to acknowledge its systemic shortcomings. Peer pressure has lacked teeth, good times were not used to reduce public debt, and macroeconomic imbalances were ignored.  This is precisely the reason why last week, on  12  May, the Commission presented an ambitious set of proposals to reinforce economic governance in Europe. We want to strengthen preventive budgetary surveillance, address macroeconomic imbalances and set up a permanent and robust framework for crisis management. I count on Parliaments support for these important proposals. They are at the heart of making Europe  2020  a success in the coming years.  Our proposals are based on two principles. First, prevention is always better than correction  not to mention letting a situation escalate into a crisis, as we have seen. Second, stronger fiscal surveillance should be accompanied by broader macroeconomic surveillance, to go to the roots and origins of sustainable economic development.  Our proposals are made of three building blocks. First, we must reinforce both the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact. The essential cornerstone of reinforcing economic governance is to coordinate fiscal policy in advance, in order to ensure that national budgets are consistent with the jointlyagreed European policies and obligations, so that they will not put at risk the stability of the euro area as a whole and that of the other Member States.  Let me be very clear about this: this will not mean scrutinising national budgets, budget line by budget line. We have neither the intention nor the resources for that. Instead, it will mean analysing and peerreviewing the broad budgetary guidelines and fiscal balance before the submission of the draft national budgets by governments to Parliament with the legal right, based on the treaty and pact, for the EU to make recommendations and ask for corrective action from the Member States concerned.  Some have criticised this, saying that this is a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. I myself am a former member of a national and the European Parliament, and I am fully aware of the sensitivities of parliamentary fiscal powers. However, everyone can see that this is not about breaching democracy or parliamentary sovereignty but ensuring that our Member States respect those very same rules which they have themselves decided on previously: in other words, to practice what you preach.  We need to introduce a truly European dimension to economic policy making in Europe: it is not enough to look only afterwards at international decisions. In the EU, in particular in the euro area, we know only too well that national decisions have an impact beyond national borders, and therefore there will have to be coordination at European level before those national decisions.  The second building block is to go beyond budgetary surveillance to broaden and deepen surveillance, to address macroeconomic imbalances. Why is this important? The divergences in competitiveness and the gap between the surplus and deficit countries of the euro area has widened in the past  10  years. This has been at the root and origin of why the financial crisis hit the EU so hard, especially some of our Member States. We should prevent and tackle emerging problems before they escalate into a crisis.  Therefore, we propose to define indicators and a scoreboard, agree alert thresholds and give recommendations and early warnings if necessary. These indicators could include, for instance, productivity trends, unit labour costs and current account developments.  It is selfevident that this does not mean that we would want to weaken the export performance of any country; of course not. Instead, it aims at rebalancing economic growth in Europe as a whole. We need to reinforce export competitiveness where needed and domestic demand where needed and possible. That is the way to play as a European team for the benefit of the whole of Europe.  Thirdly, we need to be very clear to whoever is watching the euro area that we will never be defeated. To discourage anyone from even trying our vigour, we need a permanent and robust framework for crisis management for the euro area Member States. The temporary mechanism established on  10  May is a bold first step in that direction, but for the medium to long term, the Commission will propose a more permanent mechanism, subject to strict policy conditionality and, of course, drawing on the lessons of recent experience. Yes, we need to avoid moral hazards. That is why we must make the mechanism so unattractive that no leader or country is voluntarily tempted to resort to it. But recent experience has shown that it is better to have a fire brigade ready for a possible bush fire than only start building the fire brigade up when the fire has already turned into a broader forest fire. It is better to be safe than sorry.  To conclude, these Commission proposals pave the way for a quantum leap in economic governance in Europe, but I also want to draw your attention to another immensely important decision  on the same day we proposed these measures  namely, the proposal for Estonia to become a member of the euro area on its own merits. Just to give you one figure: while the average debt in Europe is, at the moment, around  75 , in Estonia it is around  7 . 5   not  75  but  7 . 5   on a sustainable basis.  This proposal sends an important signal to all that the euro area will withstand pressure with selfconfidence, and sustainable economic and fiscal policies will bring fruit for Member States. All in all, the Commissions initiatives, once adopted, will lead to a substantial deepening of economic governance in Europe and to a prudent widening of the euro area. Indeed, in the EMU, it is high time to fill the E with life.
8837639 author: Philip White:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, this discussion today on the Europe  2020  strategy has been extremely interesting and useful for us, the Commission, as was this mornings discussion on economic governance. I would like to thank you for this opportunity and for all the messages you sent on this strategy. On behalf of the European Commission, I am particularly grateful to Mr van Nistelrooij, Mr Grech, Mr Corts Lastra and Mr Hoang Ngoc for their reports.  I am prepared to continue a discussion on various details and even nuances concerning the Europe  2020  strategy. However, at this time, let me concentrate my answers on some of the key aspects of the discussion with a few concluding remarks.  First of all, I would like to stress once again the importance of the strong involvement of the European Parliament in the various upcoming steps linked to the Europe  2020  strategy: first of all, the opinion of the European Parliament on the integrated guidelines; secondly, at a later stage, the role of the EP as colegislator on various proposals to be made under the flagship initiatives; and not forgetting, thirdly, the next multiannual financial framework to make sure the future EU budgets better reflect the priorities set for the European Union through the Europe  2020  strategy.  Let me also be very clear about the objectives of the strategy. It has a dual objective. First and foremost, it is an essential pillar of the response of the Union to the current crisis. It is an essential tool for strengthening coordination of economic policy inside the EU 27  and, of course, within the euro area. But besides this shortterm objective, this new strategy is about equipping Europe with a strategy  actually, as Michel Barnier outlined in his opening statement, a programme for action  to enable the European Union to exit the economic crisis by restoring economic growth and making sure this growth translates into more and better jobs.  But we must aim for a different kind of job creation than in the past  a more sustainable one, not only in ecological terms but also economically, socially and financially sustainable. It is about restoring a competitive European Union capable of ensuring the sustainability of its unique social model  a competitive EU that is a global leader in terms of tackling climate change, an EU that invests more in its people through more and better education and, finally, an EU that strengthens social cohesion by combating poverty.  Of course, as outlined in the Commissions conclusions during this mornings debate, this return to strong growth is only possible if we make sure that in the coming years, our Member States undertake the necessary fiscal consolidation, taking account of their respective starting points, not undermining a fragile recovery, and looking at the expenditure side at the same time as the revenue side. These are all very important elements.  I would like to stress once again the importance and the complexity of the fiscal problems that are currently on the agenda, but I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that this financial and economic crisis is much more complex than just speaking about budget deficits. At the root of the crisis, you will find a fundamental malfunctioning of the financial sector, starting with the banking sector, the correction of which is also essential if we want to start a sustainable recovery from this situation. We also have to address other causes of the recent recession  like the lack of an industrial policy and, to some extent, the lack of a complete success of our previous strategies  to achieve a knowledgebased economic growth and spread this growth to every region, every corner of the European Union.  That is why we have to reinforce our efforts in terms of economic governance, reinforce our efforts for financial regulation, and also achieve better economic, social and territorial cohesion.  Altogether, I strongly believe that there is no alternative for Europe but to launch this strategy and to launch it very quickly. If Europe does not restore its growth path, it will decline economically and will therefore also decline politically. While we are discussing this new strategy, most of our main trading partners have not only already put in place  10 year longterm social economic development strategies but they are already implementing them.  But, if there is one lesson to be learned from the current economic crisis and from its predecessor, the Lisbon Strategy  and I agree with Mr Kelly that often this Lisbon Strategy is exposed to too harsh a criticism  it is that delivery of reforms is key for success. It is therefore urgent to launch Europe  2020  at the June European Council and make sure that both the EU and its Member States start the implementation immediately thereafter.  At this point, I would also like to thank the Spanish Presidency for the efforts it made in bringing together the Member States and for supporting this strategy in recent months and, no doubt, in the coming weeks. There can be no delay, considering the current economic situation and the crisis we are currently going through. We owe it to the citizens to provide them with solutions to exit the current crisis and enhance the coordination of economic policies, while, at the same time, preparing a return to smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. By acting together in a coordinated way, we will have the necessary weight to be successful on the global stage as well. The Commission counts on Parliaments support in making sure the Europe  2020  strategy can be launched rapidly and successfully.
2390344 author: Sarah Jones:  Member of the Commission.  Mr President, it is my pleasure to address you today on the Union for the Mediterranean and the report prepared by Mr Vincent Peillon. This valuable contribution by the European Parliament is particularly timely as it outlines some of the key challenges facing the Union for the Mediterranean in the months to come  and, by the way, Mr Peillon, I fully agree with the introduction to your report on that debate.  With the Treaty of Lisbon now in force, the European Union now has an enhanced and more cohesive institutional identity and a mandate to act more effectively on the world stage. At the same time, most Mediterranean governments have pursued an ambitious agenda of economic reforms, and the European Neighbourhood Policy is transforming relations between the European Union and its Mediterranean neighbours.  Since  2004 , political contacts have increased in profile and intensity. Trade has increased at doubledigit rates aided by a steady process of liberalisation and regulatory convergence. European Union assistance has been tailored to partners reform needs and its volume in the current financial framework has increased substantially.  This is what we have achieved in our bilateral relations. However, in the Mediterranean, even more than elsewhere, our network of bilateral relations between the European Union and individual Mediterranean neighbour countries needs complementing with SouthSouth integration and cooperation and the creation of a truly regional economic area. Regional integration can make as important a contribution as national reforms to boosting investment and growth, reducing the wealth gap between Europe and its Mediterranean neighbours and, alongside this, ensuring greater convergence around our shared values and in our democratic practices.  SouthSouth integration and intraregional integration projects, such as the Agadir free trade agreement, are also key to creating the five million jobs which are needed every year to meet the needs of the regions young population. The launching of the Union for the Mediterranean in Paris in  2008  gave a new impetus to the EuroMediterranean partnership, made a strong bid for coownership and shared responsibility through a copresidency system, put more focus on concrete projects, and provided a technical secretariat to promote regional integration and spur investment.  As we all know, its implementation has been slowed down by increased tension in the Middle East, but there has been progress with the launching of the proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. There is now space for cautious hope that the political circumstances in the region may become more conducive to cooperation.  Against the background of major global challenges such as the international economic and financial crisis, climate change and energy security, the Union for the Mediterranean will have to deal with the political situation in the Middle East, launch the operational functioning of the Union for the Mediterranean Secretariat and take stock of progress made by the partnership since July  2008 .  It is an opportunity for a collective reformation of our commitment and political will to create an area of peace, stability and shared prosperity in the Mediterranean. To achieve this, the partners should also look specifically at the future development of the Union and at what it can deliver on the ground in terms of projects, jobs and growth.  The Mediterranean area is extremely dynamic, and the young generation are asking for more jobs and better opportunities. They are asking for more accountability and a democratic representation, better education and easier mobility to travel and to study. Their demands are not always easy to meet, but ultimately, they should be the beneficiaries of our collective action.  If we put into place practical projects, such as access to water, food and energy sources, and improved civil protection capabilities, it will be in the interest of our peoples.  The Union for the Mediterranean is about placing people, entrepreneurs, nongovernmental organisations, universities and, above all, young people at the forefront of civil society, cooperation and economic development. Better involvement of the citizens should also be accomplished by means of the full participation and involvement of elected representatives.  This is why the Commission firmly believes that a vibrant and strong parliamentary dimension reinforces the democratic legitimacy of the partnership. The role of the EuroMediterranean Parliamentary Assembly should be further consolidated and its work better articulated with the other bodies of the partnership.  We all want the Union to work, and we all know it will be judged on its ability to deliver concrete projects for the region. The energy interconnections, the motorways of the sea to connect southern Mediterranean port facilities with European ones, and the Mediterranean solar plan are areas of considerable potential in terms of investment, job creation and enhancing trade relations. If we want to tap that potential, we need the private sector and the major financial institutions to work hand in hand. And for this to happen, we need one catalyst, and that is the secretariat of the Union for the Mediterranean.  After several months of hard work by the  43  EuroMediterranean partners, we eventually managed to adopt the legal status of the secretariat, to appoint the secretarygeneral and to approve a provisional budget for the functioning of the secretariat. At the heart of our relations with our Mediterranean partner countries is our desire to promote security, growth and stability in the region. But there is also the abiding conviction that we are taking part in an even more ambitious project: building a region of peace and affirming our common goals and values.  I am sure that together with the commitment of the European Parliament and with the parliaments of the European Union Member States and of our partners, and with a strong impetus from the EuroMediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, we will rise to this challenge.
4614299 author: Jennifer McNabb:  rapporteur.  Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues who contributed to the elaboration of this important report which outlines the need for an EU strategy towards the South Caucasus region. The South Caucasus is not only a region in the immediate neighbourhood of the Union  Romania and Bulgaria have a sea border with it  but also a region of great strategic importance for the Union in political, economic and security aspects.  Therefore, the European Unions main objective there should be to participate actively in its stabilisation and to encourage the development of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia towards stability and democracy; to establish good neighbourly relations and integration in EU policies. The European Parliament supports strongly all the initiatives which increase the EU presence in the region and, in particular, the most recent one, the Eastern Partnership. It offers a valuable framework for increased regional cooperation, introduction of visafree travel to the Union and conclusion of comprehensive free trade agreements. This is a twoway process that requires efforts and dedication from both sides; it is in the vital interests of the three countries to continue their efforts towards further democratisation.  Good governance, political pluralism, rule of law and respect for human rights are of paramount importance for determining their future relations with the Union. Therefore, the European Union should continue providing financial and technical assistance to them in order to promote these principles within the framework of political conditionality. The regions strategic geopolitical location, its increasing importance as an energy, transport and communication corridor connecting the Caspian Sea and Central Asia with Europe and the growing EU preoccupation with energy security suggest a more active participation in the energy projects of the region, including the completion of the Nabucco pipeline project.  However, these ambitious EU policies can hardly be achieved when there is a big shadow over the region: the unresolved conflicts in Georgia and NagornoKarabakh. They are also a serious impediment to democratisation, political stability and social and economic development. Unfortunately, it was owing to the  2008  war in Georgia that the Union realised that it needs to play a more active role in the region as far as conflict prevention and conflict management are concerned. The deadlock situation due to these conflicts and the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty justify an increasing proactive EU policy. This is particularly valid for the NagornoKarabakh conflict where the Union has been practically absent. Simply stating support for the work of the Minsk Group at this stage is not enough if the EU takes seriously its new, more active role in foreign policy.  The Union is the international mediator that is accepted by both sides and whose presence does not raise controversies. There is a need for the Union to lead the international efforts for rehabilitation and reconstruction in this conflict area by initiating reconciliation projects, peopletopeople programmes and contacts, and by sending a mission into the region once a political solution is found.  The conflicts in the region also demand a special effort with regard to the situation of the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, which has serious humanitarian consequences. The European Union has the means and experience to contribute to the creation of a more tolerant atmosphere in the South Caucasus. It should also draw from its own historical experience and show to the people of the region that they can live together in peace and prosperity and can restore the good relations and trust which historically existed. It is a main task for the Union to try to convince the leaders and the people  the hearts and minds of the people  in the region to support the peace initiatives, not the threats, not the tensions. So there is a good future if we try to do it all together.
3139756 author: Katarina Corless:  Member of the Commission.  Madam President, as I have said on previous occasions, our aim is to ensure that consumers know what they are buying and what they are eating, thus making it easier to choose a diet for themselves and their families in tune with their needs, their wishes and their goals; citizens  consumers  have a right to the right information. I would appeal to honourable Members to keep this firmly in mind throughout the debate.  Before turning to the substance of the proposal, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sommer, for preparing the report, and also the shadow rapporteurs. Whilst being sympathetic to most of her statements, I cannot say I agree with all of them. I should also mention the input from other committees, IMCO and AGRI.  Allow me to briefly highlight the most important issues covered by the proposed amendments.  The question of mandatory origin labelling is very important and needs careful assessment. Indeed, there is a recurrent demand for the mandatory provisions of such information for some foods. The Commission could partially accept the proposed amendment for an extension of the cases of mandatory origin labelling. Origin labelling for basic primary foodstuffs which have not undergone substantial processing and are generally considered as single ingredient products could be a pragmatic option. However, given the complexity of the matter, the application of any mandatory labelling should be subject to the entry into force of delegated measures and be based on impact assessments.  Legibility is a major issue and one of the main complaints that consumers make. This is a key demonstration that we are putting consumers first in our debate and I hope that honourable Members can support the idea of a minimum font size. It is thus regrettable that the amendments tabled would undermine the aim of having measurable criteria as a basis for enforcement.  I share the concerns of honourable Members about imitation foods. I am therefore happy to see Parliament table an amendment containing a provision to explicitly prohibit such misleading practices. However, the introduction of a definition and specific designation of such products would provoke legal problems, and we therefore need to find those designations which give correct and unambiguous information to the consumer. I am also pleased to note the broad support for mandatory frontofpack nutrition labelling and the endorsement of voluntary schemes by Member States.  The principle that consumers should know what they eat should apply not only to prepacked foods but also to food that they buy over the counter or when they eat out. I am therefore not in favour of amendments which would limit the scope of the draft regulation. That said, I am open to changing the text on nonprepacked food so that allergen information alone would be mandatory, while Member States could decide on further mandatory requirements for such food.  Turning to the suggestion for mandatory labelling of nanoingredients, I am pleased to accept the amendment in principle, although there needs to be a suitable definition.  Finally, on the issue of nutrient profiles, let me state that I cannot accept the amendments to delete or modify Article  4  in the proposed way, as this provision would undermine the existing regulation on food claims. We are all aware that many claims are misleading for consumers; some because they are not substantiated, others because they do not give the full picture of the food in question, claiming only their positive aspects. It must also be stated that claims are made on the sole initiative of the manufacturer for the purpose of selling more products. We are not imposing nutrient profiles on anyone. We are insisting on nutrient profiles where manufacturers choose to market their products through claims, so that consumers can have balanced food information.  The establishment of nutrient profiles does not prohibit or in any way limit the food products that manufacturers can produce. Food manufacturers can continue to produce whichever way they want to. However, it is unfair to our consumers and citizens to allow claims that may mislead them. It is, for me, a question of providing our citizens with honest and full information about the products which they are consuming. Let us not forget that the Claims Regulation was adopted following indepth debate amongst the institutions. The core principles of the regulation remain valid and relevant. Having said this, I am looking into the establishment of nutrient profiles with an open mind and I am ready to consider positively certain exemptions as they relate to traditional and basic products with an important dietary role.  On this basis, I urge you to support the Commissions endeavours to ensure that we have a meaningful basis to protect consumers and foster innovation in the food sector.  Thank you for your attention. I now look forward to an interesting debate and hearing your views.
3989577 author: Sebastian Cameron:  VicePresident of the Commission.  Mr President, I was very impressed by the work which has been done by your rapporteurs. I was also very impressed by the way the different political groups are going in the same direction, with small differences. These are not important as the road and the destination is the same and that is very important.  Thank you also for underlining  all of those who have spoken, the rapporteurs and also the authors of the oral question  that we do not need any other papers, we need action. I agree with you because, actually, we know what we want and we know why we want it. We know that the only way for our society to advance is to have gender equality, not only in womens affairs but horizontally.  That was exactly the reason why, for the first time in its history, the Commission started its fiveyear mandate with an opening statement, as it has been called, with a Charter which is a political commitment of each member of the Commission to advance equality between men and women within his or her portfolio and thus, a commitment by the Commission as a whole to have gender equality high on the agenda.  That is one thing. The second thing is: how do we get the action? How do we put the flesh on the bones of this Womens Charter which the Commission pledged itself to in March? Here we come to the implementation. Firstly, I have asked all my fellow Commissioners to provide an input into the strategy, so it will not only be the Commissioner speaking to you now who is responsible for gender equality, but it will also be the other  26  Commissioners who will put on the table their contributions in their specific departments and responsibilities. This is very important because it has never happened before, and I believe that it is in the spirit of what all the political groups have presented here.  How did we come up with these ideas? The five priorities in the Charter have not appeared out of the blue. They reflect the result of the broad stakeholder consultation we conducted in  2009  in preparation for the new strategy. I will come back to the strategy later on.  Let me first speak about the very important reports that have been presented by the European Parliament. First, Mr Romeva i Ruedas report. It is line with the Commissions position on how the crisis affects women and how responses to it should take into account the impact on women. I have already drawn attention to this issue in the latest annual report on equality between women and men, underlining that this crisis affects women more than the previous recessions did because women now participate more in paid employment and are often at the weak end of the job chain. At the beginning of the crisis, we saw that male unemployment was rising very strongly, mostly because of the problems in construction and in industry. Now we see that the unemployment of men and women is rising at the same level and the risk is that due to public budget costs and  hopefully not too much, but also  cuts in spending on gender equality, this will certainly have an impact on womens employment. So it is very important that we are aware of this and that we have to put measures forward. That is why I am firmly supporting efforts to incorporate gender equality considerations into recovery measures. I believe that the crisis is a unique opportunity to implement the policies which will make the labour market and our society more genderequal in the future. It has been already said very clearly by the Presidency that the employment rate of  75 , which is our goal, cannot be obtained if we do not have women participating.  Turning to the gender perspectives of the Europe  2020  strategy, in the three main elements of this, nothing can be obtained without women. Women make up  60  of university graduates and we do not utilise them in the labour market but, if we are going for the smart growth, the green economy where we need the minds and where we cannot leave those very well trained intellectual women aside, we will never reach our goals without women. That is why I believe that women need to be helped in order for the  2020  strategy to have a positive result. The targets cannot be reached if we do not significantly improve the inclusion of women in the labour market. That is why I think it is very good that the European Parliament has constantly underlined the strong gender dimension of the strategy  rightly so because we really need to ensure that women contribute to the strategy and also reap the benefits of the strategy.  Our gender equality strategy, which I will present in the autumn of this year, will contain many very concrete elements  not for the next few months but for the next years. We will have to have a real road map regarding how we want to implement the very concrete elements between  2010  and the end of our mandate  your mandate as European parliamentarians and my mandate as European Commissioner. The strategy will therefore aim to improve governance and policy dialogue and will be implemented in close cooperation with the main partners at European level. Something which was said in this Chamber, and which is absolutely right, is that we could write a gender equality strategy now, but they must be put into practice in the Member States. We see how all the instruments of the stakeholders which have been constructed over the years  since the Beijing Platform  are functioning well. In times of crisis, we have to see that they continue to function well and that nobody will try to eliminate them. I count on Parliament to help. If something like this occurred to a government, I am sure that we would at once speak up in this House.  So this cooperation on which the ideas of the future strategy have been built  as I said at the beginning, it was the stakeholders who came in on the public consultation on this  has to be brought to a fruitful dialogue and what you call for  a regular dialogue. I therefore underline the report on the new strategy drafted by Mrs Figueiredo. I think your idea, rapporteur, of an annual tripartite meeting between Parliament, Council and Commission to review what we have done in the course of the action is an excellent one. I think it will be very good to take it up because it will give everybody an incentive  the Commission, Council and also Parliament  to do more to help. Such a gender equality dialogue could be based on the annual report on gender equality drafted by the European Commission. I think that could be a very active and concrete way to proceed.  I also count on the Member States to support the Commissions action in the area of gender equality, first by endorsing the new strategy, of course, after having heard what Parliament has to say about the proposals I will put on the table at the end of September, and also by renewing the EU Pact for Gender Equality.  In summary, there are three areas in which I want EU action to be very effective and very tangible, although when I speak of three areas, that does not mean that they are the only three areas, but I think we could perhaps make out of those three areas our main goals.  First, we will have to take decisive action to tackle violence against women and ensure effective protection of victims. Our common judicial area must be an area where victims feel treated with dignity, respect and a high standard of protection and support, not only in one domain but in many domains. I have made it a priority to ensure that in the first half of  2011 , the Commission presents a comprehensive package in that respect. I know that the Belgian Presidency wants to take stock of what has already been done, what is in the pipeline and what needs to be done in an important conference which will take place some time in November. There will be a progression from the preparatory work done under the Spanish Presidency, the stocktaking and the preparation for complementary actions in the autumn, and then a comprehensive package at the beginning of  2011 .  I would like to reconfirm what I said during my hearing and what has been clearly said also in the Commissions Charter: the Commission will use all possible instruments, including criminal law if needed, to eradicate female genital mutilation. We believe that this is a brutal practice which can, under no circumstances and with no excuses, continue to be a reality in Europe.  I will also be preparing a legal instrument to enhance the participation of women in decision making. You are right: women are, except in university studies, severely underrepresented in decisionmaking positions at all levels, both in public and in private companies. Europe will have to act to close that gap as much as possible.  I know that I have not spoken about all the other elements, such as the various kinds of leave we might add to maternity leave, the targets on child care facilities, the pay gap and the options we have in order to introduce more transparency on these problems. The labels, the charters, the award and so on are all going to be on the agenda; all of this will be on the table at the end of September.  Regarding those concrete actions, you should then really come in and say that this is nonsense, this is not strong enough and say what you think we need on them. We are working on this together with my collaborators. We have heard the input of all the stakeholders. We have seen the input of your reports, of your resolutions and we have got the input from the Ministers who have been meeting in a very important conference during the Spanish Presidency. Altogether, I think we will manage so that you will say, four years from now, Yes, we have done it.
10203630 author: Sarah McNabb:  Mr President, firstly I congratulate Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on the amazing feat of achieving consensus in the Committee on Research. Technological Development and Energy. I think she is well placed through her excellent report to achieve consensus in the plenary session of Parliament.  Energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the European Union. As far as the environment is concerned, we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in Rio. We are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure.  As far as competitiveness is concerned, we see a reprehensible and incredible waste of money throughout the European Union; billions and billions of ecus are being wasted in energy usage that is not necessary. Think of the purchasing power which those billions could release to our economy. Larger firms are, of course, aware of this. Our target through this programme has to be the smaller firms and individual households. They must make the decisions which will allow us to save that energy and save that money.  If we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in  1973 . Since then, however, there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries. The energyintensity use in most of the European Union is worsening. That is unacceptable.  The SAVE I programme was very small beer, a very small amount of money. It is being evaluated, fortunately, before we move on to SAVE II. One would have hoped the lessons from SAVE I would be learnt. That is not so, as I shall explain later on. One of the lessons from SAVE I was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which Member States have to enforce. There were ambitious plans for legislation. Very little of that legislation has appeared. It is true that we have legislation on the efficiency of boilers, fridges and freezers, labelling, and there is more to come. But that is not enough. We know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers. They have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance.  Let us look at the lessons. Firstly, legislation is what works. Secondly, you must have targets and you must monitor them. The target in SAVE II is not ambitious;  1 . 5   increase yearonyear is not ambitious. I would like to see an indicative programme issued by the Commission and monitored throughout the Member States.  Another lesson that is important, not from SAVE I but from the regional programme, is that you must incorporate measures on energy efficiency into the regional work of the EU and its policies. They help impoverished regions. Of course the same would apply to third countries. I would like to see far more emphasis in our dealings with countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean areas on energy efficiency.  One area which must be emphasized above all is transport. Transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil. We have not done enough in that sector. Then there are domestic and industrial appliances, insulation for the heating of homes, and in some parts of the EU for the cooling of homes. There is a good home rating scheme developed in my own constituency which should be far more widespread. It must be made easier for third parties to finance energyefficient measures and for the growing industry of energy services to be helped. This makes us competitive, remember. Combined heat and power is another very sensible measure which needs encouragement; as do education and information throughout the EU, particularly to the target groups. We need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them.  Employment would be greatly helped by an extension of energy efficiency. This has been proved in study after study. I am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the Council of Ministers which cannot even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the SAVE II programme. That is indeed reprehensible, given the urgency.  I think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the European Parliament representing people in every Member State. That will is to say:  Let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency . SAVE II is nowhere near ambitious enough. It has not learned all the lessons from SAVE I. It is a very limited, minimal approach but it is absolutely essential that the Council of Ministers knows that the European Parliament is backing it very strongly indeed.
6726586 author: Frederic LaCourt:  Mr President, I am pleased to advise the House that the Commission can accept all the amendments proposed in the recommendation of the Committee on Transport and Tourism relating to the interoperability of the transEuropean highspeed rail system. These amendments reflect the stance taken by the Commission in its communication to Parliament on the common position, and I am always pleased, as members of the Transport Committee will know, when there can be such ready agreement between ourselves.  The Commission cannot, however, support the amendment from Mr Soulier  Amendment No  12   because it would complicate the interoperability framework which we are establishing, and that contradicts the efforts to achieve simplification.  The House will be aware from our communication that there is much in the common position which causes us concern  even if, like the rapporteur, Mr Castricum, we have some sympathy with the fact that the less ambitious common position of the Council is in part a response to the difficult financial situation of many of the Communitys railways.  That said, however, all governments should avoid reducing the scope of the meaning of interoperability to such an extent that it relates only to the technical capacity of structural subsystems in a way which gives priority to preserving existing national networks. That cannot be the right approach in a time of change when for every sensible transport and economic reason, we should think continental. It is very obvious that in the very nature of highspeed train systems, interoperability is absolutely essential for the economic viability of highspeed trains is fundamentally undermined by the delays that otherwise will continue to take place at borders and prevent a meaningful network of highspeed trains across this continent.  Obviously, it is contradictory and fanciful to suggest that the interoperable transEuropean highspeed rail system which is needed can be achieved without requiring the existing integrity of national networks to be extensively adapted. The Commissions approach, which is, I believe, generally supported in this House, is to strive to achieve an integrated transEuropean highspeed rail system which is capable of competing with other modes of transport on fair terms and in meeting passenger needs. That, of course, means the needs of all passengers, including those whose mobility is impaired. The House is in the debt of Mr Watts who drew specific attention to that issue in the course of this debate.  It is Parliaments emphasis on interoperability that makes me welcome the amendments of the Transport Committee which are before the House today, and I hope that they can be supported by all sides of the House. In particular, I urge Parliament to give backing to Amendments Nos  6 ,  7 ,  8  and  9  relating to the technical specifications for interoperability. These technical specifications constitute a new and welcome approach in a directive and they apply the proposed directives technical provisions to lay down standards or norms.  The amendments also seek to restore the full force of our original proposal to the environment, operation and user subsystems. Different national laws on operation and the environment can obviously be a real obstacle to interoperability, so these aspects must be incorporated into the directive, otherwise the good work done in ensuring interoperability of technical standards will be wasted.  Finally, I particularly commend Amendment No  11 , because it reintroduces the concept of consumer protection as an essential requirement in this proposal.  As Mr Watts said, highspeed train interoperability is hardly an inspirational rallying cry. Although, it must be said that if your train is held up for a long time at a border because of the need to make crew or technical changes, it is possible to develop quite a revolutionary set of feelings about the barriers which still cross our transport system, especially if you are late for a meeting or if it a very hot day and the children are thirsty. So, highspeed train operability will, as highspeed trains become more extensive, enter the main stream of political vocabulary. I know Mr Castricum and others will welcome that civilized development.  The delays that are encountered can be ended for highspeed train passengers in the near future. Then we can make further progress by fostering the interoperability of socalled conventional trains. I am sure that Mr Castricum and other Members of this House will want to be part of that advance. I welcome their attitude and their effective work and I hope that it is an attitude that is increasingly shared in practice by Member State governments throughout the whole of the Union.
8341820 author: Jennifer Green:  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a comprehensive package of discharge decisions before us, allowing us an overview of the most serious problems that we have to contend with in the proper implementation of the budget. The citizens of the EU are entitled to require that every last ECU should be managed in a transparent, effective and economical way, and today, like last year, we must once again conclude, on the basis of the Court of Auditors analyses, that there are major flaws in the system. However, the very fact of discussing these deficiencies openly and frankly can go some way towards generating confidence. Nothing should be swept under the carpet. In this respect, all the reports paint a very clear picture and have the support of my group.  As I see it, there are two main areas of difficulty. We must cut the ground from under the opportunists. What do I meant by that? If Member States find a way to make some money on the side from milk quotas, and if their little scheme receives the retrospective blessing of the Commission, in the sense that there is no insistence on the repayment of ECU  2  billion, this encourages the hope that putting your hand in the Unions till will ultimately pay off. My colleague Mr Samland, and of course the Council, will have more to say on this point.  If the rules on the administration of the Structural Funds are not observed, and if this does not incur, for example, the suspension of further payments, then such an approach is actually being encouraged. It is a fact that  80   of the EU budget is spent by the Member States, and it is precisely there that significant deficiencies are emerging. However, we shall get nowhere simply by issuing appeals. As long as the EU budget functions with the present high level of subsidies from the Agricultural and Structural Funds, there must be a range of sanctions mechanisms to prevent irregularities going unpunished. The Commission should therefore take very seriously all the proposals made by the Committee on Budgetary Control for securing and recovering sums wrongly disbursed.  As regards external policy, the important thing is to overcome difficulties in the treaties, in order to achieve a more transparent spending policy and genuine cooperation between the two arms of the budgetary authority. That applies equally to the European Development Fund and to the common foreign and security policy.  Parliament has repeatedly called for the EDF to be integrated into the budget. The reasons for taking such a step are obvious, and led the Court of Auditors to comment that it was hard to draw any comparison between what was intended and what was implemented. I would therefore say to all those who argue that a refusal to grant discharge would be an insult to development policy in general and our commitments under the Lom Convention in particular: it is quite the opposite! The financial subculture that we are currently sustaining is creating major administrative weaknesses. We are meant to grant discharge, even though we have no influence or effective political control over how the resources are spent. That has to change, not least in order to improve the quality of our development policy!  Refusing discharge will, therefore, send the right signal to the Intergovernmental Conference, to tell them that it is time they came up with an institutional solution to this dilemma. I also expect the conference on the revision of the Treaty to produce clarification of the common foreign and security policy and associated budgetary matters. It is unacceptable that the Council should decide on joint actions  such as the one in Mostar  and that these should be financed from the EU budget, without the Council at the same time adhering to the procedures for managing the appropriations. There is a major procedural loophole, and unfortunately it now also affects discharge, because at the end of the day, Parliament cannot discharge the Council.  I am grateful to Mr Wynn for including the conclusions of my working paper in the motion for a resolution, and I am very hopeful that the special report on foreign and security policy announced by the Court of Auditors will give us a good basis for making more detailed proposals to the conference on the revision of the Treaty.
7566418 author: Amy Smith:  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, eight discharge reports have been presented, not quite in the order indicated on the agenda, but we appreciate the reasons for that. It is impossible to speak on them all in four minutes. I wish to look at only a few key points, but I should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the rapporteurs.  I shall begin with a word about the authority to grant discharge itself, and about our Committee on Budgetary Control. For  20  years now, we have had the authority to grant discharge, and we have constantly been developing it. We rely mainly on the annual report and the special reports of the Court of Auditors, for which we are grateful to the Court, but also on the position of the Council when it is available in time  as it was in this case. However, despite our repeated requests, clarification of the position was presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control not by a member of the Council, but by a senior official, though I imply no criticism of him. He performed his task well in so far as he could. Now you, Mr PresidentinOffice, have addressed the House, and I think you have also listened carefully to what has been said here. Our comments have been directed mainly at the Member States, but it is not the Member States to whom we must grant discharge.  I should like to turn now to the issues involved. This time, the discharge of the Commission involves two instruments which have been used for the first time  instruments, as I said, directed specifically at the Member States. The first innovation is our vote on the clearance of accounts for the EAGGF, submitted by the Commission for  1991 . Clearance of accounts was previously classed as a technical procedure for which the Commission was responsible. Parliament had little to do with it. It is thanks to Mr Cornelissen, as rapporteur on the  1992  discharge, that the problems from previous years have been raised. A particular problem which has been brought out into the open is the loss to the Community of some ECU  1 . 6  billion on milk quotas in three Member States.  Detailed discussions between the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Commission have produced reform as regards the clearance of accounts decision, which now completes the discharge already granted for the year in question. This procedure is being applied for the first time for the year  1991 , with the very good report by Mrs Kjer Hansen. The rapporteur deserves our thanks for highlighting the difference between the technical and political aspects. The necessary financial corrections applied by the Commission to the Member States are absolutely nonnegotiable where losses to EU funds are involved. If this is not the case, then the discharge for the clearance of accounts will have to be suspended until the monies are recovered. An initial tangible result of Parliaments insistence on protecting taxpayers money is that the first tranche of the unpaid milk quotas has been received.  The second innovation, the Statement of Assurance, or DAS, by the Court of Auditors, has farreaching implications as regards discharge. Although there is no legal requirement on Parliament, and although an improvement in staffing levels would enable the sampling method initially developed by the Court to be further refined for specific Member States and sectors, we must take pains to include the certificate in our decision. The rapporteur, Mr Wynn, has done this in the motion for a resolution from the Committee on Budgetary Control, and his readable explanatory statement provides us all with an invaluable aid to understanding this complex issue. I would like to thank him particularly for that.  I am very concerned at the figure of  4  , arrived at by the Court, for errors concerning payments, but in the light of the measures initiated by the Commission with the SEM  2000  programme  and thank you, Mr Liikanen and Mrs Gradin  and particularly on condition that the Commission recovers the outstanding sums and identifies the accounts to which they relate, and that we check them, I am prepared, with these considerations and conditions, to support the constructive approach proposed by the rapporteur in the first year of trying out the DAS procedure. My group therefore backs the recommendation to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the general budget for  1994 , in spite of the shortcomings that have been identified, and subject to the appropriate conditions.
2051296 author: Lynne Whittacker:  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hardly think that I shall be taking up the whole of my five minutes, which some of you will no doubt be glad to hear, in view of the lateness of the hour, and those of you who know me know that I do actually keep to time. Within the framework of the Uruguay Round decisions, the European Union is committed, under the Blair House Agreement, to growing a maximum quantity of oilseeds for the nonfood sector on setaside land. The background to this arrangement is as follows: the setaside scheme was introduced as part of the  1992  agricultural reform in order to limit the supply of cereals and oilseeds for food. The cultivation of certain agricultural products for use in the nonfood sector is permitted on such land. The production of methyl ester  known as biodiesel  from oilseed rape gives rise to a byproduct, rape cake, which, like soya meal, can be used in animal feedingstuffs. These feedingstuffs now compete with certain imported feedingstuffs, most of which are imported from the United States. The European Union has therefore undertaken, under the abovementioned agreement, to limit the amount of this rape that is grown for the nonfood sector to a specific quantity, in this case  1  million tonnes of soya bean meal equivalents.  The present proposal by the Commission is intended to introduce measures to restrict the rape cultivation in question if this figure of  1  million tonnes of soya bean meal equivalents is exceeded. Depending on how you calculate it, this quantity is equivalent to a cultivation area of about  1 . 2  million hectares of rape, a figure which so far has never been reached in the European Union. This scheme has no effect on expenditure from the European budget. However, in  1995  the amount produced was  940  tonnes, which fell well short of the maximum permitted quantity of  1  million tonnes. This figure, which is based on the Commissions calculations, must clearly have been set too high as a result of using conversion coefficients which were no longer appropriate. As a result of the reduction in the setaside quota a falling trend is actually expected in  1996 .  The Commissions proposal therefore appears, at first sight, to have been presented prematurely; on the other hand it does give producers a degree of security in planning their production, and it should be seized  and used  as an opportunity to get ahead in setting a new trend towards making greater use of renewable raw materials. That is also the reason why I have to reject Amendment No  3 , which lays down that, in the theoretical case of the permitted maximum quantity of  1  million tonnes of soya bean meal equivalents being exceeded, in some circumstances a further, punitive setaside area should be imposed the following year. It was precisely this that we were trying to avoid in this report, which I drafted.  I should just like to make a few brief comments on the amendments. The maximum limit of  1  million tonnes applies only to byproducts intended for food or feed use. Many byproducts can however be used for other purposes. For example the meal that arises as a result of rapeseed extraction, also known as rapeseed cake, is an excellent protein concentrate, but can also be used, for example, in alternative energy production, or as a soil improver in arable farming. Amendment No  1  therefore seeks to make it clear that this type of byproduct, which can be used for purposes other than feed or food use, for example as a source of energy, as a biogas fuel or as a source of humus, is excluded from the calculation of the maximum permitted quantity of  1  million tonnes. This means that our farmers have the chance of developing this alternative fuel on a larger scale, if they are able to grow an unlimited quantity of rape on their setaside land.  The coefficient for calculating the soya bean meal equivalent of rape meal and sunflower meal currently used by the Commission  though not, as far as I am aware, laid down anywhere in a legally binding form  is too high. The reason for this is that the change in the range of oilseed varieties in recent years has resulted in a reduction in the crude proteinfat content. Amendment No  2  takes these recent developments into account by setting lower coefficients which are legally binding. The coefficients proposed by the EDN are of course better from the mathematical point of view, but in practical terms they are not really enforceable at the present time. Nevertheless, we suggest that these coefficients should be reviewed every year and adjusted under the management committee procedure.
4613224 author: Helen Brown:  Mr President, Commissioner, the Annual Economic Report covers everything: monetary policy, budgetary policy, wages, the labour market and, just in case we might have forgotten it, Mr de Silguy finished off just now with the single currency, etc. Over and above that, we have commentaries by Mr Cassidy and Mr Wolf. Since we are talking about a gnosis, a dogma, commentaries are of course appropriate. And we find that the central problem is unemployment, which is a major breakthrough. All this, of course, is clearly perceived by our rapporteurs. They even outline analyses of the causes, without going into too much detail. A profound structural crisis, says Mr Wolf; excessive taxation, says Mr Cassidy. But it is all fragmented, to such an extent that one says to oneself there are only two possible answers: either all these dazzling intellects are idiots, which I do not believe, I say at once, or there is something else.  Stupidity, first of all. They told us that the single market would mean the creation of five million jobs. Now the single market exists, and there are  18  million unemployed. In the absence of stupidity, a causal relationship might have been established. Well, no, there is no causal relationship. Stupidity! They tell us that privatization is a way of filling in the hole in public financing, yet it is privatization that is digging the hole:  6 ,  800  privatizations worldwide since  1980 . Mr Cassidy, British Steel was privatized and threequarters of the jobs were lost; British Airways, on privatization, saw its workforce cut from  56 ,  000  to  19 ,  000 . And who compensates the unemployed? The State. And how does it do that? With taxes, which absorb all the income from privatization. Instead of having a higher income, what we get is a deeper hole.  The stupidity, the idiocy of the convergence criteria, Mr de Silguy! The French Government, trying to comply with Article  104 c and the  3   public deficit, increases taxes. Taxes go up, consumption falls, sales fall, profits fall, the taxable base falls, income falls and the deficits get bigger. Stupidity  and here perhaps Mr de Silguy may agree with me on the part of Mr Jupps Government and the other European governments.  So what is the answer? Is it all really evidence of stupidity? To those who know Mr Cassidy and Mr de Silguy, obviously not. They are dazzling intellects. So there must be something else, and to find the answer we need to take a look at the beneficiaries of these policies. Who will benefit from the privatization of French Telecom, of Belgacom? Not the States, which will lose the substantial dividends these companies were paying. To the contrary, the international charges will change, they will become more profitable for the companies, involved as they are in a large global market.  Mr Cassidy, in paragraph  33  you tell us that we need to reduce the fiscal burden on labour. Thats all very well, but how is it to be done? It could be paid for, for example, by a tax on CO 2  , which will increase the costs of energy, something that is paid for by private individuals. Naturally, the companies will find that their social charges fall in the meantime. And I do not stress the reduction of the rate of taxation on companies, which cannot have been very beneficial to private individuals, or even on pension funds, as mentioned in paragraph  34  of Mr Cassidys report. The sickness benefit will be broken up and pensions will be broken up and no one will remember that when a Maxwell or a Pan Am or a TWA vanishes from the scene it is the State that pays instead of the companies, which for their part have creamed off the profits in the meanwhile.  Clearly, this is not all a matter of chance. In any case, Mr Cassidy, without making the point explicitly, you say on page  12 , and I quote,  unemployment: the European Unions priority . You didnt say the fight against unemployment , you said unemployment: the European Unions priority . This clearly shows that unemployment is created voluntarily, because it allows a profit to be made out of immigration, which causes wages to fall, out of the opening of frontiers, which causes the cost of labour to fall, out of policies of deregulation, liberalization and privatization, which open up the promised land of the dismantling of the electricity, air transport and pensions industries, and out of the policy of taxation of capital, which has been unbelievable over these past ten years.  Mr Cassidy, Commissioner, you have taken us back to the nineteenth century. You have taken us back to the days before the Welfare State. Its a fantastic trick. From that standpoint, you have all my admiration. You have fully achieved the task you were given of robbing the poor to give to the rich.
6179913 author: Katarina Bauer:  Mr President, I was interested to hear the point Commissioner De Silguy made about the similarities between Mr Cassidys report and the Commissions annual report. If that is the case then Commissioner De Silguy has been looking at rather different documents to those that this House has looked at. The one significant thing about the Commissions annual economic report is its breathtaking complacency.  The Commissioner comes before us today and says that we can expect a growth rate of markedly less than  2   within the European Union this year. He then talks about the need to consolidate confidence in the European economy. When President Santer took over the Commission he said the key feature of this Commission would be that it would do less better. The only thing this Commission has done so far on economic policy is less. We are still waiting for the better to be delivered.  The Commission document talks about a paradox in the European economy. It says that we have strong economic fundamentals and yet we have depressed growth. There is no paradox here and the Commissioner knows this. Many economic experts are telling the Commissioner that there is no paradox in Europes economy. The fact is that if the European Commission continues an approach of wishful thinking, hoping and believing that at some time in the future the European economy will pick up again, we will reach this point next year and we will find that the employment crisis will be worse and there will have been no change in business confidence.  In the next few weeks the European Commission has the chance to change that with its broad economic guidelines. I seriously suggest to the Commission that it looks very carefully at the recommendations in the Cassidy report because when that report is voted tomorrow in this House it will win a substantial majority across all the political groups. We will not be satisfied when the Commissioner comes before us again if the broad economic guidelines are simply a further example of chanting this mantra that we must wait and things will get better in the months and years ahead.  Let us look at the detail. Mrs RandzioPlath mentioned the mix between monetary policy and fiscal policy. Inflation is now at historically low levels. We accept that we have to have price stability. But why do we have this preoccupation with such tight monetary policy and fiscal policy at a time when we have such historically low levels of inflation. There has to be a better balance between monetary policy and fiscal policy in the European Union. The broad economic guidelines should recognize that. We must try to get shortterm interest rates down.  This House accepts that to deal with currency fluctuations we have to try to reach the goal of economic and monetary union. There is no doubt about that. We are fully behind the Commission on that. But we have to recognize that we have to gain public confidence for this project. Unless there is a change in the direction of growth and unless unemployment is reducing in the European Union, we are going to get to the Spring of  1998  and there will be little public confidence in the important initiative of the single currency.  We talk about a crisis of confidence. Of course there is a crisis of confidence. You need only look at the people, for example in Germany, France and Spain who do not known what is going to happen to the social muddle of their economy. They do not know what is going to happen to their social benefits because governments are using EMU as an excuse to cut the social programmes. We need to have mediumterm budget programmes and proposals and that should be highlighted in the Commissions broad economic guidelines. We need to give people some certainty and some transparency about what governments are planning for the next two to three years.  As far as the public is concerned, consumer confidence will not be regained unless people feel that there is some job security, that they are not going to be thrown into poverty or onto the scrapheap at some time in the future. Where are the flanking measures to bring about retraining and investment that is necessary to give consumers confidence for the future?  Lastly, on the issue of investment: we cannot sacrifice public investment in the name of fiscal consolidation. That is a shortterm political goal and it will lead to the destruction of further confidence in Europes economy. In conclusion, if, when the Commissioner comes back to us with his broad economic guidelines, these are based upon the annual economic report of the Commission, there will be a strong move in this House not just to condemn the broad economic guidelines but to reject what he is proposing to us.
4088678 author: Amy Merx:  Ladies and gentlemen, it is perhaps a platitude to say that sustainable development is a challenge for all of us. Environmental problems continue to get worse in developing and industrialised countries alike.  However, there has fortunately been much greater public awareness of the size of the problem and the need to act so that many countries have endeavoured to include environmental issues in their planning processes and decisiontaking. The European Community, with the active participation of the European Parliament, has been behind the development of environmental policies both in the Community and supporting developing countries in their attempts to achieve sustainable development. One example of this is the content of the Lom Convention concerning ACP countries, agreements with Latin American countries and with ASEAN.  Against this background the proposal for a regulation on environmental measures in developing countries is aimed at promoting yet more application of the principle of sustainable development and contributing to the integration of an environmental dimension into the process of the development in developing countries  bearing in mind, as always, the desire to improve the living conditions of the local population.  The measures are put into practice under the regulation of environmental measures in developing countries and clearly reflects a new Community and international context which stems from the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, held in June  1992 . Moreover, the measures which have been mentioned will complement other Community instruments as well as certain actions carried out by Member States or at international level, all aimed at making the most of cooperating in the field of the environment and acting as a catalyst, in particular through training programmes and strengthening capacity as well as pilot projects which are aimed at testing and promoting new approaches and innovative methods.  The experience we have gained will make it possible to improve overall assistance to development given by the Community and should lead to bigger scale funding through the main budget headings. I am certain that the European Parliaments decision on the amendments which are being debated today will lead to an improvement of this regulation, a significant one, therefore contributing to the creation of an appropriate framework.  Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament for the excellent work it has done and in particular its two rapporteurs, Mrs TaubiraDelannon, Mr Pimenta of the Committee on the Environment and Mr Brinkhorst, of the Committee on Budgets, whose reports reveal a very thorough knowledge of the question of environmental aid, as well as genuine personal commitment to the principle of sustainable development.  As for the amendments which have been tabled, I should like to say that  33  of the  49  amendments tabled, i.e. approximately twothirds, can be given Commission support. Amendments Nos  7 ,  19 ,  30 ,  41 ,  42 ,  44  and  48  will be partially withdrawn by the Commission. In addition the Commission feels that Amendments Nos  1 ,  2 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ,  25 ,  26 ,  31 ,  32 ,  34 ,  37  and  43  are totally unacceptable. The Commission cannot accept, in other words,  16  of the  49  amendments. I refer to Amendment No  3   which may be a surprise, for strictly formal and technical reasons but not for political reasons (as this is noncompulsory expenditure the Commission and in particular this Commissioner will be very satisfied if Parliament manages to attain its objective of  50  million ECUs) as well as the other amendments which cannot be accepted by us, namely Amendments Nos  20 ,  24 ,  27 ,  28 ,  29 ,  33 ,  35 ,  36 ,  38 ,  39 ,  40 ,  45 ,  46 ,  47  and  49 .  I should like now to refer to the main aspects of the Commissions position in this respect. In some cases, the Commissions reluctance is due merely to the drafting of the amendments. As far as more substantial questions are concerned, some of the amendments, in particular Amendments Nos  20  and  27 , contain elements which from our point of view introduce a certain rigidity which would not be compatible with the aim of launching pilot activities in the field of the environment, in particular with concern for flexibility, something mentioned here by Mr Pimenta.  Other amendments, such as Amendments Nos  29 ,  41 ,  42  and  44  would give rise to new procedural problems, in particular concerning the requisites of the interinstitutional transmission of information which would not be viable and which might put at risk the proper management of the budgetary heading, given that human resources are very limited at the Commission, in particular in DG VIII.  Finally, some of the amendments tabled would bring about a change to the current committee procedures, Amendments Nos  38  to  40 , or else they would affect the very organisation of the Commission, as is the case of Amendment No  36 .  Obviously, we share a common aim: sustainable development in terms of the environment, as already stated and emphasised in Parliaments report. The adoption of the Regulation on environmental measures in developing countries, with certain amendments as the European Parliaments request if we introduce those which the Commission can accept  will mean a significant advance in this direction. I would like once again to thank the Members of this Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteurs for the work which they have done on this issue.
5480639 author: James Smith:  Mr President, it is not in any sense part of my job this morning to answer comments made by previous speakers. However, just in parenthesis, I will make the point, following on what my colleague, Karl von Wogau, has just said, that the question of the United Kingdoms relationships with the European Monetary System and exchange rates is, of course, one for markets and not for governments. But that is a matter which I am sure we will discuss endlessly in the coming months.  I speak this morning as the rapporteur on the annual economic report and part of the responsibilities that go with that rapporteurship is producing a report on the broad economic guidelines.  My first suggestion, addressed to the Commission  and I promise the Commission that this will be my last criticism of it  is that it would be most helpful in future if the Commission could contrive to produce its annual economic report and its broad economic guidelines in sufficient time for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment because these two projects are the joint responsibility of those two committees. It would be helpful in future years if we could have the broad economic guidelines a bit earlier, because the trouble this time is that we have had to rush to conclusions because of the deadline at the end of this week of the  21  and  22  June meeting in Florence. This has meant that we have not really had time in the Economic Committee to produce a report debated in committee, adopt amendments in committee and then present to this House a report that is properly balanced in the way in which the three previous reports are balanced and reflect consensus in the committee.  The compromise resolution, which we shall be voting on later today, is therefore unsatisfactory in some respects, but that is an inevitable part of having a compromise. Compromises, by definition, do not satisfy everyone and we would say that the joint resolution is all right up to a point but we shall be tabling a number of amendments to it. One is to remove the Commission from the line of fire of criticism, because you will have noticed that our resolution is somewhat critical of both the Commission and the Council. But we believe that at this stage it is too late to criticize the Commission.  We shall also be tabling amendments on matters which we feel very strongly about and which, indeed, are in our question to the Council, because at the moment there is no reference in the final resolution to the need for the Member States to analyse the best practice in Member States and, in parenthesis, the United States, in order to identify the policies which can achieve results in bringing down unemployment rapidly. This is something which the committee as a whole felt strongly about in the resolution on the annual economic report and it is a significant omission that it is not in the resolution to wind up this debate. I hope that the House will agree to incorporate this point and that the House will also agree to the addition that the Member States should create an environment where employers are encouraged to take on workers. It is not part of my job to anticipate what the speakers on behalf of the Social Affairs Committee may say on that matter, but it is very clear, with the high level of unemployment in the European Union, that it is unacceptable that there should be something like  18  million unemployed in our society, with  50  million living in poverty or in near poverty.  Coming to the substance of what the debate this morning is all about, this is actually the European Parliaments opportunity to put forward its views to the European Council which meets in Florence at the end of this week. You will find in our resolution something to the effect that our President should take this resolution to Florence.  The other important point is paragraph  11  of our resolution which calls upon the Irish presidency to report very quickly back to this House on what action is going to be taken by the Member States on the broad economic guidelines. I do not know whether there is a representative of the Irish presidency here but, if not, perhaps the representative of the Italian presidency would be kind enough to pass on that message and a copy of our resolution.
5370827 author: Lynne McNabb:  Mr President, I should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their presentations this morning. I shall concentrate on the broad economic guidelines. The Socialist Group firmly rejects the guidelines adopted by the ECOFIN Council recently and we are deeply unhappy with the approach taken by the Commission regarding the economic prospects for the European Union.  The first point is to look at the economic fundamentals which the Commission claims are favourable. We have historically high levels of unemployment. Some  50  million people in the European Union are suffering social exclusion and poverty. Internal demand in the EU is depressed because of the attack on social protection and jobs. Real wages are stagnant. Business confidence fell again last month for the seventeenth month in a row and there is a collapse of consumer confidence. Public investment has fallen over the last ten years from  3 . 5   of GDP to  2 . 5  .  If the Commission and the Council claim these are favourable economic fundamentals I would like to see the statistics they are basing this on. Clearly Europe is in crisis and we need coordinated measures by the Commission and ECOFIN to try to bring Europe out of that crisis. The growth rate this year is  1 . 5  , which I imagine will be estimated as even lower by the end of the year. There may be a growth rate of  2  or  2 . 5   next year. It is completely insufficient.  That is why we have produced a very critical report on these guidelines. In particular, I want to refer to the guidelines as approved by the Council. Mr De Silguy did not refer to the way in which the guidelines were changed by the Council and I should like the Council and Mr De Silguy to deal specifically with the changes that have been made to those guidelines by the ECOFIN Council. I hope the Council is listening carefully to this. There are ten cases where the Council has deleted points from the Commissions guidelines, which Parliament was already unhappy with.  Why did the Council delete the reference to a better economic policy mix more favourable to growth? The ECOFIN Council deleted this. I want to know why. The reference to the European Parliaments opinion on the economic annual report was deleted by ECOFIN. Why did it delete that? A durable detente in macroeconomic policy is essential to relaunch activity and strengthen growth in job creation in the medium term. Again, in the Commission text, the Council deleted that reference. Why did it do that? Monetary policy can, within the spirit of Article  105  of the Treaty, contribute in a substantial manner to the achievement of Community objectives as laid down in Article  2  of the Treaty. That reference was deleted. Why? The Council has to explain to the House why it made these changes.  The Commission text referred to the social partners and to the dialogue that exists. The Council deleted the reference to an efficient coordination between the different actors concerned and between countries as essential to ensure the coherence of these policies. That reference was deleted and we want to know why. It deleted the reference to the fact that measures aimed at improving convergence go hand in hand with the promotion of growth and employment in the medium term. Why did the Council delete that from the broad economic guidelines? In relation to TENs  the transEuropean networks  the statement proposed in the Commission text, that action has to be taken to remove the last obstacles to the achievements of the TENs projects is deleted in the Council text.  The ECOFIN Council is acting with extreme arrogance if it believes it can simply disregard growth and employment in the European Union. We were deeply unhappy in this House with the Commission text but at least it made some effort to refer to the need to bring unemployment down and to deal with the appalling levels of growth. The Council text is completely unacceptable to this House. If the Council would look at paragraph  10  of the resolution that we will vote at lunchtime today it will see that we insist that in Florence these deletions from the Commission text be reinserted, and that is the text which should then be endorsed by the Council.  Unless that happens I warn the Council that whether it be the Italian presidency winding up to their presidency in July or Mr Spring or Mr Bruton presenting the programme of the Irish presidency, this Parliament will roundly reject the conclusions of Florence, unless the Council gives a real commitment to bringing unemployment down, getting growth back to Europe and ensuring that the EMU project can continue on a path that will mean something to the citizens rather than simply being something which is pursued by central bankers.  (Applause from the left)
6176631 author: Michael McNabb:  Mr President, I want to thank Prime Minister Prodi, President Santer and the PresidentinOffice, Mr Dini, for their reports. I listened with particular and careful attention to the two reports by Mr Prodi and Mr Santer on the evaluation of Florence. I must admit my evaluation is somewhat different to theirs. I was a little surprised at their upbeat response particularly with regard to employment.  The Madrid Summit six months ago has become known as the summit of the single currency. Florence was heralded as the Council of employment. The reality was that BSE and the policy of noncooperation in Europe which the British Government had instigated was hanging like a cloud over the Florence Summit. Indeed, that cloud contained over  100  pieces of European Union legislation vetoed by the British Government.  So the signs and signals in advance of Florence were not auspicious. Therefore, I suspect that most people in the European Union were not surprised that nothing came out of the Council with regard to employment, bearing in mind the chaos in the Union and its decisionmaking at that moment. Perhaps it was our expectations as politicians dealing with this issue that were naive and unrealistic. We actually expected something on employment out of the Florence Summit.  People have spoken about the resolution of the policy of noncooperation in Europe and resolution of the BSE crisis. The Florence summit did not solve the BSE crisis. What it solved was the institutional and political crisis created by the British Government. It did not resolve BSE. Of course we welcome the framework agreement to look at the BSE crisis, but I want to remind the Council of the firm determination of this House and of my group for real action to protect the health and safety of European consumers as the paramount issue in the BSE crisis. That has not gone away and is not resolved.  (Applause) On employment we have heard pious words, pious words and pious words. Over two years of discussions in summit we have seen very little real action on employment. Only if action follows those words are the words great. In his introduction, Mr Prodi commented on the firm determination of the Council in Florence on the detail of EMU. What a pity that same firm determination was not there on employment. There was a total lack of action with regard to employment. No resources, no greater coordination, no adjustment of the broad economic guidelines and the policy mix within it which we had urged on the Council just a few weeks ago.  We should take one example: the transEuropean networks. There was great expectation that finally, after all this time, there would be funding for the TENs coming out of the Florence Summit. We know now that is not to happen, it is not to be. Not only was there no money for the TENs, but let me remind everybody in this House and the Council, only four days before the Florence Summit, after months of tortuous negotiation between Council and Parliament, after meetings that lasted not just through the day but through the night, there was agreement in conciliation on the TENs. In Florence, four days later after that agreement, the Council decided unilaterally to change the conciliation on TENs. I want to say now to the Council that if it is going to take unilateral action of that sort, I hope it will come to this Parliament. I hope Mr Prodi will be able to tell us how the Council intends to bring that change to the agreement made four days before with this Parliament to this Parliament so that we can be a part of the TENs agreement  as we deserve to be.  (Applause) Let us be in no doubt that if this House had unilaterally changed that conciliation agreement, the Council would have been furious with us and we have a right to be furious with it. If I sound angry, it is because I am angry. The people of the European Union blame us all for lack of action on employment. They do not differentiate between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. They blame the European Union and my group does not want to be associated with this failure on employment. It is the single most important issue for our people and we want our citizens to see, as we in this Parliament have done, that we care about them and we care about employment. We must now look forward to Dublin. We will do that but please let us not overestimate the decisions of Florence. To most of our citizens, and to us, they were a great disappointment.  (Applause)
5340419 author: Michael Reid:  Madam President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Mombaur. This is the traditional thing to do, but this evening I mean it completely. I congratulate him for three things. For producing not simply a report with comment but also a well workedout action plan, for having organized a hearing for the Committee on Energy, Research and Technology at which we were informed quite clearly what the future was and, of course, for achieving a unanimous vote in committee.  The European Parliament has a longstanding commitment to renewable energy. It has shown that in its resolutions but more practically it has shown it in enhancing the budget for those energies. I am very pleased that Mr Mombaur accepts the target of  15   of primary energy by the year  2010 , a target set in the Madrid Conference and in the action plan following that conference recently followed up in Milan.  If we look at the current situation then, it is disappointing: nowhere near  15  , more like  5  . A whole range of barriers  technical, fiscal, regulatory  a lot of ignorance and a considerable amount of inertia amongst the Member States. We have competitors who do not show that inertia. The United States and Japan are jumping into markets: huge contracts recently signed in China and India by American companies for photovoltaic arrays. We do not even use the money that is available in the European Union as well as we could. We could be using the structural funds to have regional projects for renewable energy. We could be using MEDA much more. We could be using PHARE and TACIS. They are overwhelmingly being used on nuclear programmes when they are not always appropriate.  The Council of Ministers has shown time after time an attitude of obstructiveness and the saga of THERMIE II is testimony to the way in which it has not seized the opportunity to enhance renewable power. It is essential that in the IGC discussions there are movements towards giving us a Treaty competence for renewable energy alongside that which we have, somewhat anachronistically, for nuclear power through the Euratom Treaty. We need an equivalent of the Euratom Treaty for renewable energy.  It would be a good idea by the way if we did something in our new buildings to do with renewable energy. As far as I can tell there is no plan to do anything at all and that is disgraceful. Does it matter? Yes, it matters because we made promises at Rio that we would meet commitments in cutting CO 2  and we have not met those promises. We are not keeping them and we will not unless we change direction. It matters because in some part of the world  in Africa, India and China  people are leading diminished lives because they have no access to electricity. There are no grids anywhere near them and only renewable energy can give them access to electricity and the sort of life we take for granted. It matters because of the potential in our own European Union and in the whole of central and eastern Europe. It matters because we are throwing away the possibility of jobs. We say that our No  1  priority is the creation of jobs. Yet we do not take one measure in the form of renewable energy which would certainly provide jobs.  So, what do we have to do? First, the action plan in Mr Mombaurs report. I hope that colleagues will look at that very carefully. It lists not only what should happen but who should do it. We should follow up progress on that action plan at least every six months. The European Union has a budget it could use. The Commission could coordinate very much better than it does the actions of all the different directoratesgeneral involved with renewable energy.  We could have a prize. I would like to suggest that it be called the Phoebus Prize after the sun god. Our Member States  and we have some influence there  should start removing some of those barriers. I am delighted to say that the industry concerned with renewable energy has this evening taken the very sensible step of setting up the European Renewable Energy Export Council. Five different types of renewable energy have come together in one export council and that is an excellent step forward. We need industry to go out and sell renewable energy.  I say to Commissioner Papoutsis that we know he has a strong and sincere commitment to renewable energy. As Mr Mombaur has said, we look forward to working with him over the next years to ensure that something which should have happened long before at least happens now.
4414201 author: Marc Finlayson:  Mr President, in supporting todays proposals in favour of small business I want to bring to this Chamber the clear experience of small business in my own constituency. I speak as an honorary member of the South Essex Chamber of Commerce having close contacts and met in recent weeks with the Thurrock Industrial Association and the Basildon Business Association and just last Friday participated with representatives of over one hundred local companies at the launch of Business Link Essex. All these organizations are committed to nurturing small and mediumsized companies. The question is what can the European Union do to help us.  Firstly, I should like to give the strongest support to action to halt the scourge of late payments which threaten so many of our small businesses. I would highlight a small printing company in Tilbury in Thurrock, S  S Printing, which finds by and large that it is working for other companies which are larger and more secure. Yet nonpayment of invoices presents a real problem to their manager, David Stear. He puts it plainly when he says that when these companies who are in debt to him pay their salaries they are doing so with his money. In another arena that would be called fraud and it is shameful that the UK has the worst record of late payments in Europe at a dismal average of  23  days. That is why our initiative to end this scourge of late payments is absolutely right.  Secondly, I wish to support the continuation of our European programme for intrasubsidy loans to small companies but to call for clear improvements in the way that these loans are administered. Eleven small companies have benefited or become eligible to benefit from South Essex since  1994 . Too many of them have told me of the difficulties associated with this scheme. Let me make it clear that bank loans are absolutely crucial to this sector of business and European support with minimum bureaucracy and targeted at job creation is a very effective way of offering support.  Precision Components in Benfleet, a small engineering company, started by the owners father from a garage and still present on the same site were enabled to invest in new equipment for the first time in four years. Before the recession in the  1980 s they invested in new capital every year and our help has returned them to the path of growth and new competitiveness. Just this week Thames Estuary Plastics of Rayleigh has had its interest subsidy from Europe confirmed to support twelve new jobs as part of a  470 ,  000  project. In addition, we will enthusiastically try to implement the new loan guarantee scheme, ELISE, in my area.  However, Terry Pearce from Precision Components remains sceptical about Europes involvement. While Thames Estuary Plastics have had to wait nearly two years for confirmation of their support, another company, Camtac of South Woodham Ferrers, have waited so long that their success in the meantime means they now no longer have need for the loan. A success story for them but hardly for Europe! Another company, Beaver  84  Ltd, of Basildon was not even told by its intermediary that its application for a financial lease was even on the list for a European subsidy. Europes role was hidden from them.  The solution to all of this is to ensure that sufficient funds are given to meet the demands and to avoid lengthy delays on the waiting lists. In Britain as a whole  700  companies have been helped but  650  more applied and were eligible. Intermediaries should be much clearer about the role of European support and all Member States should operate a reserve list system to help eligible companies who were not first in the queue.  Finally, on the European information centres, we receive no service in Essex. There is a huge gap to the north of London, in Essex, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Essex has  66 ,  000  overseas and UK businesses providing  590 ,  000  jobs. Commissioner Orejas answer to my parliamentary question on  13  June when he said that services are provided from Norwich or should be sublet from Norwich is wholly unacceptable. Let the Essex County Council Library Service be a European information centre. No new money is needed. We simply want the title so that we can get access to the information, to the publications and to the network of other centres. It is not working at the moment in Essex. Look at our case once again.
10270541 author: James LaCourt:  I would like to thank my colleague Dr Langen for all the hard work that he has put in on this issue and I think I can say on behalf of the Socialist Group that there has been a genuine bipartisan approach to this subject.  The effects of implementing the proposals contained in this Commission document will be immense. Every company which deals with contracting entities in any of the utilities sectors will have to adjust its working practices to conform with the rules that we impose upon them. Before we do that, we have a duty to ensure that those rules are necessary, will work to enhance European businesss rights and opportunities, and will serve their part in the opening up of global markets in our fight to improve employment and to create a level playing field.  Even though this is an internal directive, it cannot be taken in isolation, just as the EU cannot be taken in isolation. The fact that these proposals are being introduced to eliminate disadvantages created by the implementation of the GPA demonstrates how we are all intertwined. So to evaluate these proposals as a whole, we should look at what we are competing against, to see what practice, or what common practice there is in the marketplace.  When we look at our major rivals  firstly Japan  the Japanese are making no attempt to draw up similar legislation to that put forward by the Commission. The United States  not only have the United States failed to introduce internal legislation to bring their home market in line with the GPA they have not even introduced the GPA itself, and what is more they do not have any intention of so doing before the election of this year, if at all. Secondly with regard to the United States: not only have they failed to introduce internal legislation to bring their market into line with the GPA, they have failed to eliminate the Buy American Act. More than two years ago they promised to do this, yet there has been no action. They have had rulings in their courts that no foreign legislation can take precedent over domestic legislation, which legitimizes their protectionist trade regime. Now with the HelmsBurton Bill, we even have the American Government taking nonAmerican companies to court over trading with Cuba. We do not condone this; we call on the Commission to actively pursue these matters and insist on the full implementation of all agreements signed at international level.  We want internal legislation to eliminate disadvantages, albeit minor ones of threshold levels created by the GPA, and to set up controls to safeguard EU citizens and businesses against corruption in the awarding of government contracts. This is very important because taxpayers money is involved here.  We also need to ensure that, whatever measures are put in place, our businesses will be left as competitive as possible, both domestically and in terms of overseas competition.  The problem is that at the moment we simply do not know what the right practices are. Representatives of all sectors of industry have indicated, at a public hearing, that they see huge problems with the Commission proposals. Unlike the Commission they did not consider these proposals as benefits but burdens, they were unanimous in their opposition. We have asked the Commission on more than one occasion to supply information on the practical effects of their proposals, they have not so done. I ask the Commission again, let us have studied consideration of the effects of each of the measures you wish to implement. Let us have costings. Let us have justifications. Let us consult on this. The Union pays out a fortune on studies every year. If ever there was a clear case for a study there is a case for one on public procurement.  We have heard much from the Commission on the distortions in the internal market caused by bringing some sectors into the scope of the directive and leaving others out. That is one question. Another is that by changing the status of sectors, do we not distort the existing market?  The Commission has also proposed to bring the private sector within the scope of Directive  9338 EEC: effectively in line with the GPA even though the private sector is excluded from the GPA. Does the Commission expect companies to run two systems, one for internal transactions and one for external, thereby increasing costs?  We have been told the Commission has a legal obligation to press ahead with this legislation. We do not know whether this is true. There is no proof that this has been put before the committee despite repeated requests on our behalf. We in the Parliament need to be cautious. We are dealing with matters which may be simple on paper yet have important implications for jobs. What we need is time. We have time to get this directive right because it does not have to be implemented until  1998 . I would ask the Commission to listen to the concerns of Parliament and industry and let us have a new directive, then we can report on it, give our response and pass it through Parliament quickly. The Commission knows what we want and we can act fairly and effectively and as quickly as possible when we get that proposal.
2638287 author: Mary McNabb:  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, not merely on the excellence of their reports but on the patience and tenacity with which they have gone about their work. I sometimes have the impression that in certain delicate matters such as that which we are discussing today the European Parliament provides  626  rapporteurs for reports coming from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities. While contributions from outside are always very enriching and welcome it makes the coming to consensus a little more difficult. But I am quite confident that tomorrow we will have come to the end of this particular long road and I think it will be to the great credit of all involved.  I should like to begin by referring to Mr Fords report and I am sure he will not be offended if I describe it as the less controversial of the two. It is, as he has said, little more than a recapitulation of elements that were already voted earlier in this year and that is the basis on which they will be coming forward tomorrow. We in the EPP have some residual doubts about the appropriateness of referring to assistants in this particular report. But in the interest of bringing the matter to a successful conclusion we will be voting for the totality of Mr Fords report. We point out that Mr Janssen van Raay will be producing a separate report for the Rules Committee precisely on the question of assistants. We look forward to that very much.  Turning to Mr Nordmanns report I should begin by underlining that as Mr Nordmann himself said, he has faithfully and honourably transposed and implemented the conclusions of the working group set up by the Conference of Presidents. For that reason, if for no other, his report would have the greatest possible claim to be voted tomorrow. I personally will be voting for it even without amendment though I did put down an amendment. I wish to speak briefly about the reasoning behind that.  What has worried me and a number of colleagues in the EPP and other groups as well has been the particular phraseology of Mr Nordmanns report:  that Members of Parliament shall refrain from accepting any other gift or benefit in the performance of their duties . I am worried about the possible vagueness and difference of interpretation that such phraseology can provoke. I have spoken to a number of individual colleagues and in some cases they might regard a book given to a Member who has spoken in the constituency of another Member as being a gift and therefore potentially unacceptable. Others would say No, it is not a gift. It is simply a courtesy which is offered to a friend within the European Parliament. I regard that as being potentially undesirable. I have had put to me two possible ways of tackling this problem, one of which has been referred to by Mr Nordmann already: a compromise amendment which would ask the Bureau to set down guidelines as to how this particular proscription is to be interpreted. If that receives a lot of support then I will happily withdraw the amendment which I put forward, which went more in the sense of saying that only those gifts that could potentially compromise the independence of the Member should be regarded as unacceptable: two ways of getting to the same goal. I repeat, even without either of these amendments, I shall personally be voting for the Nordmann report tomorrow but I think it would be a little clearer and a little more precise if we could find some way of making more exact what the Nordmann report has in mind.  In conclusion, let me say a word about transparency. I agree very much with Mr Ford that the enormous majority of colleagues in this House behave honourably, conscientiously, and that what is important is to convince the European electorate that is the case. I do not regard there as being enormous skeletons in the closet, terrible secrets to be uncovered. But we rightly in this European Parliament demand transparency of the Council. We regard the Council as having the obligation to be seen to be acting fairly and constructively. In demanding more transparency of the Council we are not accusing the Council of corruption. We are merely saying that that is something which all the electors of Europe have a right to see and to have firmly established. What is right for the Council, it seems, is right for the European Parliament. That is why I and my group support the general underlying philosophy of the Nordmann report.  One final thought, if I may. Oscar Wilde once said that when two people had the same opinion, one at least of them is superfluous. In agreeing with the philosophy and opinions of Mr Nordmann, I hope very much that I will render neither him nor myself superfluous, but I wish him all the best of luck for tomorrow and I am quite confident he will get the majority he deserves.
3103882 author: Alastair McNabb:  Mr President, i dtosach bire ba mhaith liomsa cad mle filte a chuir roimh Tnaiste na hEireann is Uachtarin Chomhairle na hAir do Comhphobal na hEorpa ar an gcad turais seo at danta aige do Parlaimint na hEorpa.  I warmly welcome the Irish presidency on their first visit to the European Parliament since taking up office on  1  July. I would briefly like to comment on the introductory remarks made by the Tnaiste in relation to the Northern Ireland situation and say to him that many in this Parliament were dismayed at the abject surrender in Northern Ireland in recent days to mob rule. The official message conveyed is that the rights of the nationalist community can be overridden by force when necessary.  This has inevitably caused deep anger within the nationalist community which must, however, be channelled constructively and with dignity. There must be no violence, no bombs and no retaliation. All must respect that the principle of consent must be upheld and consent must be sought and given freely, peacefully and without intimidation or coercion. The freedom to give consent is also the freedom to withhold consent and the consent of both communities is needed.  The British Government pledged in the framework document to exercise their jurisdiction with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland in their diversity with emphasis on full respect for and equality of civil, political, social and cultural rights and freedom from discrimination for all citizens, on parity of esteem and a just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities. That is the pledge.  Both communities in Northern Ireland are vulnerable in different parts in Northern Ireland. I deplore the sectarian attacks to which each of them have been subjected in recent days. The spirit of reconciliation and mutual accommodation is needed all over Northern Ireland in place of the spirit that the majority rules. The human, political and economic cost of such an attitude is far too great and risks repeating the shameful intimidation of people from their homes which has scarred Northern Ireland so often in the past. There is a great responsibility on the British Government and the Irish Government and all the northern parties to give the peace process fresh impetus after the grave setback of the last ten days.  I am sure that the work of the Irish presidency over the next six months will yield positive results for the many difficult problems which are confronting decisionmakers in the European Union at the present time. The most serious political, social and economic problem confronting the Union at the present time continues to be the urgent need to find job opportunities for the  18  million people without work in Europe today. Commission President Jacques Santer recently tabled proposals for a Confidence Pact on Employment containing a series of measures which have the potential to promote economic growth and new job opportunities provided that our respective governments agree to work with each other and with the Commission on the implementation of President Santers plans.  The Irish presidency has decided that tackling unemployment will be the main priority of its term in office. If the presidency is to succeed in making progress on this important issue, then it must persuade the Unions Member States not just to give political support to the Confidence Pact on Employment, but also to provide the funding to implement the proposals and construct the TENs projects put forward by President Santer.  While it will not be easy to get the agreement of the national governments on the politically difficult question of funding, the Irish presidency must guard against efforts, which are already under way, simply to divert resources from the structural funds and the common agricultural policy to fund these new proposals. Such a solution would effectively result only in funds being transferred from the agricultural and peripheral regions to the denselypopulated and already highlydeveloped regions of the centre of the Union. This would not be in the best interests of the European Union as a whole nor would it be in the best interests of the countries on the periphery such as Ireland.  The presidencys second priority is to tackle the drugs problem. Effective action to confront the illegal drugs trade requires a wide range of measures such as harmonizing laws on drug smuggling and money laundering and increased cooperation between police and custom agencies. Most of all, as customs and immigration control within the Union are progressively reduced, increased cooperation will be required to confront the drug smugglers along the Unions external frontiers. Resources will have to be transferred from the Unions internal frontiers, where they are no longer required, to the external frontiers.  The most appropriate method of transferring resources to the Unions external frontiers to combat drug smuggling is by making money available in the annual budget of the Union for upgrading equipment and increasing training to these agencies. The  1996  budget does not contain any money to assist in policing the Unions external frontiers. If the presidency is to succeed in making progress in tackling the drug problem then it should, as a matter of urgency, bring forward proposals for making money available from the Unions  1997  budget for this purpose.
7944216 author: Nancy Finlayson:  Mr President, last year when I spoke in this debate, I said that annual reports provide an opportunity not to look backwards, to assign blame and criticize, but to look forward and learn from the difficulties that we have had in programme implementation. In short, we should not be revisiting the same old problems when we have this debate. Unfortunately, that seems to be too often the case. The key problem that I want to highlight today in connection with the Teverson report, in the light of the budgetary debate in  1997  and Councils decision on  25 th July to cut structural fund payments in some areas, is the perceived problem of underutilization of structural funds. We urgently have to take this issue on but what I fear is happening is an attempt by some Member States to renege on agreements that they made in Edinburgh and fail to meet the targets they agreed. That is something that we have to take up because it could result in a longterm discrediting of regional policy.  I would like to commend the Commissioner for her decisive action in putting a proposal to the Venice informal Council to improve the efficiency of structural funds. I would like to commend the Commission on its SCM  2000  programme and of course, in the context of the Teverson Report I would like to thank Mr Teverson for taking on board my own Groups amendments in committee to this report.  There are, of course, areas where I believe we can improve performance: better training for administrators through exchanges; streamlining administrative processes; strengthening the role of regions and local authorities; combatting the irregularities in fraud by establishing clear audit trails; better access to information. But some of his proposals would require a bureaucracy in Brussels ten times the size of the current Commission. It is simply not realistic to ask the Commission to monitor every individual payment to final beneficiaries. Member States must take their own commitments in these areas seriously.  I fear that the proposals will come to nothing without a change of mind by several Member States, my own of course included. They now seem to specialize in putting new obstacles in the way and of course the latest one is meeting the EMU convergence criteria. We cannot stress enough that closing the gap between poor and rich Member States  achieving cohesion  means Member States must take the responsibility seriously. I am very unhappy that the nontakeup of funding has been a dominant theme in the media and is discrediting the good work that we do in structural funds. I believe that the Member States are now moving towards selfimposed nonutilization of funding and slowingdown our processes, which will lead to problems in the longer term. When Member States signed up to the Edinburgh Agreement, they knew the commitments they were entering into; they knew they had to meet the convergence criteria and it is simply not good enough now to make a linkage which is not in the interests of our regional policy programmes.  I therefore say, on behalf of my Group, that we reject the attempt by the French Government to link structural fund spending to EMU criteria. We cannot change the rules halfway through the programmes and we must denounce the hypocrisy of the Council of Ministers of paying lipservice to launch actions on unemployment and then reneging on their commitments to tackle unemployment through structural funds. The real threat to implementation comes from the Member States themselves. We need more accountability, we need more transparency, we need more devolution but we above all need more commitment. I would like to ask the Commissioner to continue with her annual reports but to come to us on a regular basis so that we can help her improve utilization by putting pressure on the Member States, so that we can take swift action when bottlenecks and obstacles occur.  We must not get to a situation where Member States are able to draw false conclusions, undermining our spending programmes where we know that they are vital to citizens opportunities. I therefore would like to encourage the Commissioner in her work, to support her in making the case for a strong regional policy and for keeping the focus on our goal of economic and social cohesion.
4690913 author: Lynne MacLeod:  Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my personal thanks to President Hnsch, Prime Minister Bruton and President Santer for their excellent contributions this morning. And it is crucial that we begin by saying this: I very much regret that so few of the Members of this House were here to listen to the excellent speeches we have just heard.  There can be nothing else going on in this building that is more important than this debate, and that message will certainly be transmitted to my Group at its meeting this evening.  In our debate last year we looked forward to the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. We were then aware that, if we were to prepare this European Union to meet the historic challenge of enlargement to Eastern and Central Europe, the Baltic, Cyprus and Malta, it was incumbent on us all to secure an effective, democratic, open European Union which, more than anything, reconnected with its people, reconnected the vision, the hope and the aspirations which inspired the postSecond World War generation to embrace European integration and reconnected that vision with the people.  Today, six months after the opening of the IGC, there is a general mood of disillusion and depression. If we allowed ourselves the selfindulgence we would have to admit that there is something to be depressed about. The Union is dismally uninspiring. Indeed, to the overwhelming number of people it is completely irrelevant. Yet it should not be so! With the global trading environment changing so rapidly that even the most poorly trained and inadequately educated can sense in their gut that life is no longer even as it was ten years ago; with the information society introducing anarchic communication potential, which all can see will accelerate the pace and nature of change  given ten or fifteen years to refine and to focus and to develop; with the world moving into regional groupings to facilitate and master the changes, at the same time that the pool of regional and local identities, languages and cultures is asserting itself again, surely our European Union  which is at the fulcrum of these changes, able to operate in recognition and celebration of the diversity of our continent  must have something more inspirational to offer our young people in particular. But, no! The last year has been characterized by stagnation and paralysis: stagnation in the fight to create jobs in Europe; stagnation in the IGC process for all to see; paralysis in our desire to defend the common policies which make up the European social model; paralysis in our ability to generate a common will on issues challenging peace and stability on our continent.  I know that I will be accused of undue pessimism and a confrontational approach but can someone explain to me why, when we have a multibillion ecu surplus on our agricultural budget, we cannot find the political will simply to transfer a proportion of that money to secure funding for tens of thousands of our young people by investing in the funding for the fourth research programme, our investment in the jobs of the future? Why we cannot find the will to transfer a proportion of that money to secure peace on our continent by rebuilding civil society in former Yugoslavia? That is not European money being spent simply on people and places far away, rather it is money spent to make absolutely sure that our children will not be engaged in a long and bloody conflict for the next generation on European soil.  Somebody tell me why the European Council cannot carry out its side of the bargain on the transEuropean networks and find the will to transfer a proportion of that money as it promised. Somebody tell me why this Parliament, which has done all in its power to support the transEuropean network project is now being told that because the governments of the Union want the transEuropean networks, but want their money as well, we here must slash the budget for education and training, job creation and consumer protection. Why some governments in the Council deny the funds for the poverty programme, help for the elderly and the socially excluded. Somebody, please tell me how it is that we can still talk about the European social model when we are being driven further down the road to the Americanization of European life, a model which I must tell you is rejected by European people who do not want to be a lowwage, insecure, illtrained workforce.  We are underestimating the determination and will of European citizens. What is missing in our political analysis and thinking for the future is the recognition of the importance of our culture to our people. Our aim is surely to preserve and protect that which is precious and unique in each country of the Union, that which gives the people of that country or region their sense of wellbeing, their security within their own cultural and historical identity and, whilst preserving that confidence for all our people, we seek to pool what is common to all of us in the search for the answers to the mounting crises of our age. Frankly, there is not much time left for us to make this Union a source of pride to its people, through adding value to their cultural and historical life.  Please, Mr Bruton, at the special meeting which you are organizing in Dublin, try to raise the ambitions of the prime ministers. Ireland has, as you said, a unique opportunity at a watershed moment for the European Union and Ireland has a proud record during its presidencies of the European Union. You asked us, Prime Minister, to help you to find the answers in securing the support of Europes people. Let us have a strong message to Europes people; let us hear that the leaders of our countries are at least united in insisting that there will be an employment chapter in the new Treaty with real bite. Let us hear that there will be a commitment not just to economic and monetary union but to people  their economic future and their wellbeing  and let us hear, as well, that the Union can be united in securing a commitment to fight discrimination against our ethnic minority population. Let us give to all those living in our countries trust and confidence in tolerance as our first virtue, to give nonEuropean citizens and residents confidence in our humanity. This is even more important, Prime Minister, given the shameful remarks made recently by Mr Le Pen. We here abhor and reject his philosophy and we are demeaned, frankly, by his presence in this House.  (Applause) Let us hear that we will preserve the European commitment to a universal public service for all its people and let us hear that our culture, history and tradition, all the diverse strengths and beauties of our continent, are what makes us tick, not just a slavelike devotion to some economic or academic model of society. Let us hear that the European social model is alive and kicking, is secure in the hands of our government leaders and will be the building block on which everything else is built.  In conclusion, after a year dominated by grubby stories of deception and dishonesty over mad cows, the trauma of the abuse of our most vulnerable young children, the continuing exclusion of  18  million people and the total stalling of any effort to improve the ecology crisis as if somehow with economic problems the environment has ceased to be of concern  after all this, it really is time to demonstrate the positive political will to move forward. We, on this side of the House, have that will but know it can only be achieved through a rededication to collective and cooperative responsibility which underpins our Europe.  (Applause)
3859124 author: Philip McNabb:  Mr President, ba mhaith liomsa i dtosac bire cad mile filte a chur roimh Taoiseach na hEireann, John Bruton, ar an ocid specialta seo, ar an cad turas d go dt Parlaimint na hEorpa.  I warmly welcome the Prime Minister of Ireland, Taoiseach John Bruton, on this, his first visit to the European Parliament. I wish him every success in Irelands presidency of the European Union.  I am privileged to be present in this Chamber this morning to listen to the debate that has taken place so far. I am proud of the fact that I am here and I very much appreciate the comments that have been made by people this morning.  The representatives of the  15  Member States are in the process of preparing draft changes to the European treaties which the Irish presidency hopes to have ready in time to present to the Dublin summit at the end of the year. This is an ambitious timescale and I hope it can be adhered to. But I believe it is far more important to find agreement on a series of initiatives for tackling the fundamental issues which are of primary concern to European citizens at the present time, even if this means postponing the presentation of a revised draft Treaty until next year.  Employment creation should be the number one priority of the intergovernmental conference. In most of our countries unemployment rates continue at unacceptably high levels. This autumn millions of school leavers and college graduates are entering the labour force and are actively seeking their first job. Most of them will have serious difficulties in finding good quality employment just like their predecessors last year and, regrettably, the year before.  The IGC negotiations provide the Member States with an opportunity to refocus the Unions policies towards initiatives which will actively promote employment growth in each of our countries. The President of the European Commission presented a series of proposals to the last European summit which had the potential to begin this process of redirecting the European Unions resources towards tackling unemployment. Unfortunately European leaders showed little real enthusiasm and failed to make financial resources available for President Santers proposals, which would involve taking coordinated action at the European level. I believe that this was a big mistake.  European countries have not been able to make serious inroads in their unemployment rates through unilateral initiatives in recent years. At the same time, our main competitors on the world stage  the United States and the Far Eastern countries  have experienced strong growth in employment levels. The European Union, the strongest trading bloc in the world, is being outperformed by both the US and the Far East. The priority of European leaders must be to reverse this process and the  15  Member States can begin by agreeing to make employment creation the number one political priority of the European Union by incorporating this principle in any new Treaty which emerges from the IGC.  The second priority of the IGC should be measures to combat international drug trafficking which is responsible for much of the crime, now a feature of everyday life in our communities. The drug trade is an international business and can only be properly tackled through effective international action. The European Union is capable of assisting the national police and customs services in their efforts to combat this evil trade provided that the political will exists at national level to work together at European level in those areas where transnational cooperation can play a useful role. If the European Union is to continue to enjoy the support of the majority of our citizens then it must show itself capable of contributing to finding solutions to the major problems confronting society.  At present, the common problems which virtually all the  15  Community countries share are high unemployment, illegal drug abuse and associated crime. The challenges are great for the Irish presidency. I wish them well. I know that they have done tremendous groundwork in trying to ensure a successful presidency. But they can only succeed if the other Member States are prepared to play their part as well.  (Applause )
4089167 author: Helen Whittacker:  Mr President, I want to thank Mr van den Broek for the statement he made about Turkey in his usual measured tones. However, I must say I am shocked at the statement from Mr Mitchell.  While he was speaking I did not know whether to laugh or cry. I could not believe we are serious in this House about asking the Council to take on our foreign policy after hearing that statement about one of the countries with whom we are supposed to be dealing in foreign policy. Mr Mitchell, I must say that I was concerned when you opened your statement by saying you understood we wanted Cyprus and Turkey to be taken together. You have missed the point entirely. Cyprus is an integral component of our political relationship with Turkey because Turkish forces are occupying the northern third of Cyprus. They have  35 ,  000  soldiers in the north of Cyprus and it was the Turkish Foreign Minister in the Turkish Grand National Assembly who recently admitted that she had released  65  million Turkish lire to pay for the transporting to Cyprus of Turkish Grey Wolf fascists who  as we have seen on video  took part in the murder of the two Greek Cypriots in the buffer zone. So, how can Cyprus not be considered as part of our relations with Turkey? Of course it is an integral part! We support the territorial sovereignty and integrity of the island of Cyprus, and Turkey is occupying onethird of it. Cyprus, we must remember, is an applicant state for European Union accession which has had a positive avis from the Commission. So, of course we want to consider what has happened in Cyprus as an integral part of our political relationship with Turkey.  I must say to you that we are not talking about Turkish Cypriots. Fortyfive Turkish Cypriot organizations have condemned the murders which took place in the buffer zone in the summer. These people were brought from Turkey specifically because not enough anger and hatred exists amongst Turkish Cypriots to do what the Grey Wolf went to Cyprus to do. That has to be an integral part of our discussion this afternoon.  Before we passed the customs union in December of last year, there were many promises, as everyone in this House remembers. Commitments were given and declarations made by representatives of the Turkish Government that they were going to improve democracy and human rights, that they were going to do something more positive about a solution to the Cyprus problem, that they were going to deal with their own peoples human rights. And we were told it was all because they wanted to do it for the people of Turkey, not because the European Union was forcing it on them. And we also heard they were going to deal with the Kurdish problem. Clear promises made.  Well the Turks, the Kurds, the Cypriots have had nothing. Nothing except oppression, intimidation and blatant denial of their human rights in the nine or ten months since that customs union was passed. In fact, the relationship has not only not improved, it has got worse in all the areas I have just mentioned. We have all received a constant stream of faxes, pamphlets, videos and eyewitness accounts of the everyday occurrences in Turkey and most recently in Cyprus. What do we get from the Turkish Government and the states that support it? Endless faxes bewailing the fact that Turkey is misunderstood and misrepresented. And I must say that is rather what I thought I heard coming from the Council today.  I know from Turkish citizens, from Kurdish refugees and Turkish Cypriots  many thousands of whom live in my constituency in North London  that they do not understand why Turkish authorities treat them the way they do and why Turkey cannot see that recognizing minority rights, respecting the dignity of their own citizens and removing the occupation forces from Cyprus would be good for Turkey. Not bad, but good!  The recitals of our resolution make clear the grim reading of what has happened over recent months. Oppression, murder, intimidation are not European values. Good intentions, expectations and promises have all been devalued by the actions of the Turkish authorities. Conciliatory resolutions and double standards have no place in our relations with Turkey. Words and promises must, frankly, be translated into political will and clear action. My group will therefore be making every effort to freeze all financial commitments to Turkey. We call on every political group in this House to support this approach and expect the Commission and the Council to respect our view and to act accordingly. Only in this way will we get real change in the relationship with Turkey.  (Applause)
6918016 author: Claire Cameron:  Mr President, following this mornings debate, we now get on to the political input, rather than just the input from the committees.  Speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group, our priorities from the very start have been to concentrate on those issues which would bring about job creation. We have been trying to show that we are serious about this in contrast to the words which the Council has continually poured out since Essen about jobcreating projects while never coming up with the resources to make those a reality. Indeed, it is also in contrast to the Commission. I do not mean this as an insult to you, Commissioner Liikanen  you and the Committee on Budgets have a very good understanding  but it is ironic when we see a PDB with cuts in expenditure and then officials from the Commission ask Parliament to reinstate those cuts. That smacks of hypocrisy. In the Socialist Group we have tried to be open in our approach to job creation.  We openly admit that to achieve that goal there would need to be a revision of the Financial Perspective, especially for those three areas that Parliament has seen as priorities: the Irish peace process, research and development, and transEuropean networks. As in the past our position is to go along with the Article  203  strategy that was outlined in the Budgets Committee last week. What we said was that if you really want to create jobs, if you really want to put money on the line for TENs, then it has to be more than paying for studies, you have to have the money there to actually create the projects and the work. That is why we are prepared to go along with Article  203  to make sure that the money goes to TENs, goes to research and development and, at the same time, that the Irish peace process is not left out of those priorities.  Having said that, we also recognize that the Ecofin Council of  14  October in effect killed off any revision of the Financial Perspective. Our role as a group is not to come along, make a lot of noise and then happily back down. If we cannot get support in this House, if we cannot get  314  votes, our group has not yet made a definitive decision but I would assume that we would go along with the strategy outlined by Mr Brinkhorst at last nights Budgets Committee. That means creating the ECU  300 m reserve, highlighting within that at least ECU  100 m for the Irish peace process, and then deciding where the rest of it would go. One assumes it would go to research and development and TENs. That is a position we are prepared to support.  It does not help our case when we get lobbied by all and sundry. When we took that decision at the first reading of the budget in committee and highlighted the strategy of going for Article  203 , I made the point that the telephones of Europe would begin to ring. And they certainly have, from Prime Ministers and Foreign Secretaries and everyone, to such an extent that we will not be taking that course of action. I have come to the conclusion that the telephone is mightier than the sword because it seems to achieve one heck of a lot more than we do by manning the barricades!  Today I got a note from the United Kingdom Permanent Representation asking us in effect to vote against the amendment that we voted through in the Budgets Committee. It starts off by saying:  The proposal for a special support programme for peace and reconciliation was made by the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, on  7  December  1994 . Wrong. It was not made then, it was made several months earlier by the European Parliament. What Mr Delors did was to get the figures wrong. He said ECU  300 m instead of ECU  200 m and we have had the problem ever since! But the note goes on to say  and I love this bit:  Parliaments justification for the proposed reduction, (that is, the Council has not met their request to raise the ceiling on structural funds spending by ECU  100 m to replace resources from the reserve), will not be understood in the areas concerned, particularly at this sensitive time .  That is probably true, but it is also an admission by one member of the Council that what we have said all along is actually fact, that it is because the Council has not come forward with the extra ECU  100 m that we have this problem. It does not help when we get stuff like that put around, Mr President, especially at a time of sensitive negotiations.  I would like to make a point about some of the amendments that will be put in by the Socialist Group. In Category  2 , we will be retabling the amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy. That will mean that we will be asking for the ECU  1 bn in payment appropriations to be reinstated within the budget. That is quite clearly the position of our group. We will be supporting the amendment from the Committee on Regional Policy and the Committee on Budgets in regard to reinstating the funds for RECHAR and RETEX. By the same token, we will be supporting the Budgets Committees proposals to ensure that the ECU  100 m for the peace process is there, but not at the expense of Community initiatives that this Parliament considers a priority.  I turn then to the resolution in Mr Brinkhorsts name. It is quite lengthy. In paragraphs  71 ,  72  and  73  it touches on the area of comitology. What it says there it means, and the message to the Council is quite clear. If you do not cooperate in this area, then there may not be trouble in  1997  but there certainly will be in  1998 .
1686449 author: Nancy McNabb:  Mr President, what we have to consider first of all when we have a look at the context of the  1997  budget are the tremendous difficulties which the Council President referred to before the votes, just before our lunch break. We have Member States who are cutting back or keeping a freeze on their national budgets as the public sector deficits have been cut back, not only to be competitive in the global economy but also for the rationale of the single currency towards the end of this decade.  Speaking on behalf of my group, I think we are right, therefore, in making sure that we act responsibly in this budgetary process and we contribute towards that goal ourselves and indeed the position of the European Peoples Party right from the start of this process, after our Budget Committee votes ten days ago, has been to underline two particular principles.  The first is that we go for a zero growth budget because that is in line with Parliaments commitment of responsibility in the budgetary process and therefore we, in contrast to the Socialists, will not be voting for the Committee on Regional Policys amendment to be voted back but we will be voting for responsibility in the structural funds, as in other parts of the budget.  Secondly, perhaps as important, if not more important, is to vote in terms of keeping the commitments which Parliament has entered into and particularly the interinstitutional agreement. We do not agree that we should go to Article  203  which in essence  if Mr Wynn would admit this  would actually rip up the interinstitutional agreement. We think that we should actually use the agreements which we enter into, try and ensure, as now, that the strategy of Parliament evolves between first and second reading and encourage the Council to come along with Article  12 ( 2 ) to have a discussion with us so that we can then revise the perspectives, but within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement, rather than simply tearing it up and saying we dont use this . It would to me, and I think to my Group as a whole, certainly be the wrong step for Parliament to take, while we are in the process of negotiating the Intergovernmental Conference, as it would show us being an irresponsible partner in the budgetary process. We are in favour of awareness at this particular time of the difficulties of the European Union, both in terms of a budgetary freeze and of negotiating within the frameworks that we have already negotiated.  There is however the question of how we can actually achieve that within the frameworks which have been set out. We believe that the proposal put forward by the general rapporteur of putting  300  million in a general reserve, with  100  million specifically allocated to Ireland so it is absolutely copperbottomed, provides the guarantee that Ireland will have one hundred million at the end of the budgetary process, in whichever category we finally allocate it. That must be a real fundamental principle.  But, as for the allocation of the rest of the  300  million, that will be in the final analysis for the budgetary authority to decide at the end of second reading. But in terms of job creation, if you think that simply by putting another  100  million on the transEuropean networks we are going to solve the unemployment problem in the European Union then I am afraid that is not our view on this side of the House. What we must think of in this negotiation  and I direct my final remarks to you, Mr PresidentinOffice  is that we must have understanding and flexibility from your institution as part of the coauthority of the budgetary process, to make sure the things that you have signed and that we have signed are things which we can actually make work in practice. Situations have changed since we signed up in  1993 ; we must make sure that it can survive as a living entity. Otherwise the risk is that, when it comes to the revision of the Financial Perspective next year, you will find a more than reluctant partner on this side of the budgetary authority when it comes to continuing with something which is rigid and clearly will be unoperational in the longer term.
10383817 author: Claire Bush:  Mr President, it is clearly important for the European Parliament that we have this debate. We believe that it is about time that the European Union took a strong political and moral stand against that iniquitous regime, the SLORC in Rangoon. I know that Mrs Jensen, my colleague, will talk about James Nicholls and the fact that Mr Spring, the Foreign Minister from Ireland, has still failed to have any decent reply from the Burmese about exactly what happened in connection with James Nicholls death in prison in Rangoon.  I would like to ask the Commissioner responsible tonight what we will do if the SLORC continue to deny Aung Sang Suu Kyis latest request for a dialogue with the SLORC. What will the Commission do if they should harm her or rearrest Aung Sang Suu Kyi? What will the Commission do? What will the European Union do when it is too late for us to act on these matters? How many times, Commissioner, do we have to listen to Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the democratic leader of Burma, ask the international community and tell the international community that only isolation and only sanctions will affect the SLORC.  They deserve the same odium, the same treatment as many of us demanded against apartheid South Africa. It is unacceptable and disingenuous to claim that dialogue or engagement is appropriate with any ruthless regime like the SLORC. They are intent on subjugating and repressing the people of Burma. The United States, as Mrs MaijWeggen has said, has had the CohenFeinstein amendment which says that the United States is prepared to take strong measures in relation to sanctions and, indeed, visa restrictions against Burma. We have no such action or statement from the European Union.  We cannot do business, we cannot appease, we cannot reach any consensus with a government which uses children as slaves, a government which represses democracy and refuses to discuss any kind of political settlement of ethnic groups.  80 ,  000  people from the Shan states and from the Karenni states have now been forcibly displaced, they have been abused and they feel abandoned by the whole world.  We talk about the actions of oil companies, Unical and Total are involved in Burma and we understand that they are responsible for violations of human rights and for the fact that people have been forcibly removed from their land in Burma. It is my understanding, Commissioner, that current proposals, which have been made by the EU in relation to Burma are quite frankly very unlikely to have any impact whatsoever on that regime. These restrictions will not make the slightest different to the SLORC. I do not exactly see SLORC members queueing up for entry into the European Union. It will make absolutely no difference to them at all.  I see no reason why, on the clear evidence that the Commission has heard, GSP should not now be withdrawn as quickly as possible. Last time I questioned Commissioner Marin in this Parliament. He gave me the categorical assurance that the GSP access would be withdrawn in November. He told me categorically. Is this still the Commissions view? Is Commissioner Marin still prepared to say this?  I would like to ask, will Commissioner Marin use the influence he clearly has to pressurize the ASEAN countries to play a more constructive role? Will the Commission be prepared to send envoys to the ASEAN countries and to Japan to discuss the options which we face? But in order to do that, in order to discuss the options it is essential for the Commission to go there with the threat of impending sanctions against the regime. We have to learn from the mistakes the United States Government made. We must not go there making demands, we must go there in order to try to have some results. We need to know at what cost it was to South Africa that the developed world ignored the pleas of Nelson Mandela and the people of South Africa. Let us remember that all that is required for the triumph of evil is that the good men and women do nothing. We should act to do something before it is too late. I have to ask, is the European Community ready to act swiftly before things deteriorate in Burma?
8403354 author: Roger Green:  Mr President, ba mhaith liomsa i dtosac cad mle filte a chuir roimh Aire Gnthai Eachtracha na hEireann chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa i maidin.  Mr President, I very much welcome the PresidentinOffice of the Council and Irelands Foreign Minister to the European Parliament this morning and I thank him very much indeed for his report on the recent summit held in Dublin.  While the summit did not result in any significant decisions, it certainly provided a valuable opportunity for the heads of state or government to discuss the state of progress of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference.  In my view the draft Treaty, which is to be presented to the December summit in Dublin, must give priority to issues of widespread concern, such as employment policy and the fight against crime.  I was disappointed to note that certain Member States continue to oppose the inclusion of a chapter on employment policy in the new Treaty. I do not agree with the British Prime Ministers view that this problem should be tackled at national level.  Over the last decade national governments in many Member States have devoted much of their energy to creating new job opportunities, in most cases without any significant degree of success. The time has surely come for European governments to work together to try to solve this huge social, economic and political problem.  The fight against crime also demands strong cooperation between Member States if the activities of drug smugglers, money launderers and organized crime syndicates  all of whom operate on the international stage  can be effectively and comprehensively tackled by the forces of law and order in our individual countries. Countries on the periphery, such as Ireland, with extensive sea coasts must be supported at EU level in their efforts to track and intercept drugsmuggling.  I welcome the ongoing efforts to reform the institutional structures of the Union, which I hope will simplify the decisionmaking and administrative systems of the Union before enlargement to the East.  However, it is my strong belief that it is more important to assess the impact of enlargement on existing European policies and, if necessary, to reform the actual policies rather than concentrate on administrative and institutional reform.  The addition of ten or more net beneficiary countries will have a major impact on the budget. The arrival of new Member States with a high level of dependency on agriculture will, naturally, have major implications for the common agricultural policy. The clear need of these countries to upgrade their industry, transport networks and environmental protection systems, will all have a major impact on the existing structural funds policy. I was genuinely disappointed that these issues were not addressed during the Dublin Summit.  The future of the common agricultural policy and structural funds, together with the obvious need for a bigger budget in an enlarged Union, are all difficult political issues which should be tackled in parallel with the Intergovernmental Conference.  Agreement on the final contents of a new revised Treaty must be accompanied by an agreement on the future direction of the major common policies and on the framework for enlargement negotiations.  All these issues are closely interlinked, particularly in the case of existing net beneficiary countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, and those countries with significant agricultural sectors, such as France.  Following the Dublin Summit there seems to be a consensus in favour of agreeing on a revised Treaty at the Amsterdam meeting of June next year. This is an ambitious target. However, it is not essential for the IGC to conclude in the first half of next year: it is of far greater importance that the Member States use the IGC to confront the issues which are of general concern to our electorates and to lay the foundations for a successful enlargement of the Union to the East, even if this requires an additional six or twelve months.  In at least some Member States the electorates will be called upon to pass judgement on the results of the IGC and their verdict will depend on the extent to which the new Treaty addresses their concerns, which are much broader than mere institutional reform.
6090347 author: Amy Finlayson:  Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their reports. There are some excellent ideas in the various reports and I hope that the Commission in the context of their work in  1997  will take on board many of their ideas.  I would like to say to the Commissioners that it is by no means a coincidence that we are having a debate this afternoon where we are dealing with all of these reports together. The reason for this debate is that we want to link industry policy, we want to link competition policy, we want to link the internal market, we want to link the policies on small and mediumsized enterprises together, because frankly, at the moment, it is the view of this Parliament that, while the Commission services in their own directoratesgeneral fulfil a very good role on behalf of the citizens of the European Union, there still is not sufficient coordination and collaboration on these various policies. I want to deal with some of issues in my short address.  We have to recognize that, given the growth rates in the European Union between now and the end of the decade, we are looking at growth of possibly around  2   or  2 . 5  . That means that the unemployment problem in Europe will not be tackled. We will still have very high levels of unemployment when we reach the end of this century.  It is also a fact that we are dealing in global markets. It is no longer the case that we have European industries. We have global industries operating in European markets. Therefore we need to create a climate that will allow those industries to thrive and to allow the small and mediumsized companies that form part of the supply chain also to thrive in the future. That is why the policy on small and mediumsized enterprises on industry policy, on competition and on the internal market must be brought together in a clearer focus.  We will ask  my group will certainly be asking  in the context of the Commissions work programme in  1997  for a new annual report to be produced by the European Commission. This should link these areas of policy, look clearly at the competitiveness of the European Union and ensure that there is compatibility between these various policies.  We also need to look at the economic impact of these various policies. I know, for example, that DG II in the European Commission produces reports on the economics of certain major policies that the European Commission may put forward. I suspect those reports filter as far up as directorsgeneral in the European Commission. I suspect those reports do not touch the desks of European Commissioners. It is essential that DG II  those people who are analysing the economic performance of European Union policies  are allowed to express their views directly to the College of Commissioners. We want to see that that happens in the future.  I want to deal with some changes in the business environment and the way in which these policies of competition, SMEs, industry and the internal market need to work more closely together. In particular I want to look at the supply chain that industries are involved in. Let us look, Commissioner Bangemann, at an industry that you and I have dealt with recently  the car industry. In the car industry of the past, all of the research and development, many of the components and so forth, were dealt with by the core company themselves. Those days have now gone.  We now have a supply chain which means that in many cases research and development has pushed down the supply chain to the first, second or even the thirdtier suppliers in this sector. There are many other sectors of the economy where the supply chain now is completely different to the way it existed ten years ago. It is the small and mediumsized enterprises that are the key to that supply chain, the innovative industries who are now designing, who are involved in valueadded manufacturing services. So our policies have to reflect that.  If we look at competition policy, too often it is used as an excuse for industry policy. Again, if we look at the car industry, we have had the bloc exemption in the car industry as far as the sale of cars is concerned. That really is using competition policy as a mechanism for industry policy. Of course, we have had the voluntary export arrangements which will last until  1999 , again using competition policy or trade policy largely for industry policy.  We have got to get these policies of internal market industry, small and mediumsized enterprises, research and development working closely together. Unless we do that we are going to continue to have growth rates of around  2  . We are going to continue to have unemployment levels of  18  million and our impact as a European Union is going to be absolutely minimal. So next year, we want the Commission to come forward with an annual report which ties these policies together, which links it to competitiveness, to see whether or not there is real compatibility between the various directoratesgeneral and the policies that are pursued by the European Union.
2390904 author: Michael Bush:  Mr President, first of all I should just briefly like to observe that my esteemed colleague, Mr Ken Collins, will, I hope, be delighted to see me rush in on this subject. Someone called Needle speaking about inoculations and injections will, I think, certainly appeal to his sense of humour.  On a more serious point, I am very happy to welcome this thoughtful report and to thank Professor Cabrol for his work in its preparation. The Socialist Group will certainly support its passage through Parliament and look forward to its implementation as soon as possible.  Let me also welcome the fact that the Commission has brought forward this analysis and these proposals after several years of preparation, particularly as it notes that it is not easy to provide an indepth analysis of the existing situation, still less so to deliver a judgment on it. In fact it is particularly appropriate that we should support this initiative now. For one thing, the context of the CJD crisis has dominated European health debates for most of the year. But  1996  also sees the  200 th anniversary of the first successful immunization, by Edward Jenner, in England.  Now, thanks to medical and social advances, we can foresee eradication of leprosy, polio and river blindness. But the ten biggest killers in the world continue to be infectious agents. Many of them could be prevented or cured for as little as one dollar per person. Our failure to do that means  50  million deaths each year are caused by communicable diseases. Earlier this year the directorgeneral of the World Health Organization warned that the world stands on the brink of a global infectious disease crisis. No country is immune , he warned. Under those circumstances no community can ignore the threat, particularly one as relatively wealthy as the European Union.  Progress in this field is achievable and is essential. The World Health Organization has taken a lead via regulations and immunization programmes, but the Commission report shows that the global picture is at best erratic, with health networks in disarray both in the developing world and in much of Eastern Europe, with economic and social deprivation being key factors.  It is significant that this is a short or mediumterm proposal at most, for many in this Parliament will agree that we could and should do much, much more than is proposed because of narrow minds in Member States. That is why it is important that a full evaluation and review of the EU network role is completed within a maximum of five years, with proper accountability to this Parliament. That is also why the list of diseases and pathogens to be covered by the surveillance system must be adaptable. In the past  20  years,  30  new infectious diseases have emerged. Just think of AIDS, Legionella, Ebola, Hepatitis C and E, and a new strain of cholera, which I have just heard has now hit the refugees in Zaire. At that rate the fiveyear review could identify half a dozen more. But the key question is how the EU will play a role within global and national developments. It is crystal clear that international health bodies are at best resistant to the concept of another tier of bureaucracy. They prefer issues such as capacitybuilding in Member States to be tackled within the existing framework, with cascades of common information.  That frankly means the money is unlikely to be forthcoming for anything more imaginative. Also, the WHO remit, the G 7  project and continuing discussions with the United States must be taken into account. Liaison will be crucial as will the rapid agreement of common technologies and language and the training of users.  So, I retain reservations, but the committee has been guided by the view of Professor Cabrol that a European Centre for the Surveillance of Communicable Diseases is desirable and we shall await the view of the Council with interest. But there is consistent agreement that what is desperately needed is clear, accurate and speedy information in a widely useable form. It seems to me that the EU should be ideally placed to be a strong spoke, if not the actual hub of that important wheel. We shall back the Commission and Professor Cabrol to work until it becomes reality.
564273 author: Philip Merx:  Mr President, in deference to the Commissioner here present I shall seek to avoid any reference to wind farms in or from Wales. First of all let me pay tribute to the Commission for its communication which has prompted this report. It has produced an excellent analysis of gas supply in Europe and we in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy have had to think hard to make some constructive suggestions and additions. Mindful of the gas directive to come, the essence of this report is that gas supply and consumption in Europe have increased dramatically both in absolute terms and relative to other sources of energy, yet we still produce over  60   of our needs within the EU with two Member States  the Netherlands and the UK  dominating output. One factor in this increased consumption has been the withdrawal of the EC directive which prohibited the use of gas for power generation up until  1991 . This, combined with opening up the markets for electricity in some Member States and new more efficient combined cycle gas turbine technology, has brought about a rapid change.  We are dependent on three third countries for the  3839   that we import, Russia, Algeria and Norway supplying respectively  51 . 8  ,  24 . 1   and  23 . 9   of our imports in  1994 . Some people feel that our increasing dependence on imports makes us more vulnerable to interruptions of supply. This report calls for more detailed risk analysis of this possibility due to political considerations, but I think it more likely that problems could arise through physical interruption by pipeline failure and the report calls also for research into cooperative projects to reduce pipeline leakage in third countries. When contemplating possible risks of political decisions in third countries to cut off supplies we must consider what these countries could stand to gain from such action and remember that the underlying ethos of the EU is to promote trade between Member States, to integrate our economies and thereby discourage the possibility we might fall out and fight among ourselves as we did in the past. So far this approach is an outstanding success so why should we not employ the same policy in our trading relations with our neighbours? I think the answer to my question is, do nothing, because these countries gain much more in hard currency and other trade from their sales of gas to EU Member States than they could afford to lose by cutting off the supply.  There are measures which would strengthen our ties with these countries and the security of our supplies of gas. First we must conclude the Energy Charter, which provides the legal framework for this trade. Second we must press ahead with the proposals for interconnector schemes which will create a true internal market in gas supply. TransEuropean networks provide both for a physical link and the means of introducing market mechanisms which underpin security of supply and offer the promise of better competition and service to consumers. There are concerns about security of supply which arise from concerns about the philosophy of liberalization and competition more than from worries about the politics of third countries. It is ironic that some should be more frightened of the benign forces of competition and free markets than by external fundamentalism or ancient rivalries. I think we should be encouraged by the changes in the UK for example, not frightened.  In my constituency in South West England, consumers are enjoying the cost benefits of the structural changes made in the electricity supply industry, amounting to a  20   reduction in prices in real terms after allowing for inflation. Since the industry was privatised we have yet to see the full benefit of open competition for all consumers. This is due in  1998  when the market will be liberalized completely, but right now gas consumers in my constituency are part of the very first pilot scheme anywhere in the EU, where full and open competition for gas applies. Since April this year gas suppliers have been free to compete, to offer their service to all consumers. Significantly  1516   of consumers have changed supplier, the others are watching to see if the promised price cuts are delivered. That is sensible. But the main point is people have the choice and we will be able to see whether the prophets of doom will be proved right or wrong. I believe they will be wrong and that is why we have reintroduced certain parts of the text from the draft report because we should take note of these developments.  Finally the report calls for a review of our dependency on gas when it reaches a nominal share of energy supply of  25  . It calls for alternative sources of supply and alternative technologies to be researched and made available as a prudent precautionary measure which, however  in the light of the record of the industry in Europe in maintaining security of supply  so far seems a remote possibility. This communication and report are important in the runup to the gas directive which we hope will follow close behind the electricity directive. I commend the report to the House.
4987461 author: Katarina Green:  Mr President, can I first of all of behalf of the whole House thank the President of the Ecofin Council for his presentation today and more importantly, for the way in which he has engaged the European Parliament in dialogue since the Irish took over the presidency of the European Union. I am sure I can speak on behalf of the whole House when I say how much we have valued his participation, not only in the meetings here in the Chamber, but also in Parliaments Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and of course the informal meetings we have had over the last few months. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs who have conducted the work on behalf of Parliament in an excellent fashion. We have been able to coordinate these reports so that we can have this general debate today on what is an extremely important and indeed a historic issue for the European Union.  We have the privilege today of having this debate on the single currency. We are debating reports which have been discussed in our various committees in Parliament, we have had the chance to discuss them in our political groups and we are now having a public debate on the floor of this House, as indeed we have had on many occasions in the past. I hope that the President of the Ecofin Council, when he presides over the Finance Ministers on Monday, encourages all his colleagues, to engage in a similar debate in their own national parliaments because that is the way we can defeat the Euroscepticism in Europe that exists at the moment on the single currency, by having public debates in our own parliaments, our national parliaments, and ensuring that these issues are fully aired.  I hope that this House will join with me in condemning any government that prevents the national parliament having a debate on what is of course an absolutely crucial issue for the citizens of the European Union. In particular he could whisper across the table to Mr Clark and encourage the British Government to have a full debate in the British Parliament in the very near future on this issue.  I would like to deal particularly with the issue of the stability pact. Let me say on behalf of my group that we remain fully committed to the single currency. We remain absolutely committed to strong economic coordination, which includes budgetary discipline, and we support the timetable for the implementation of the single currency from  1  January  1999 . We are not prepared, however, to accept the budgetary straightjacket that the German Finance Minister is trying to impose on us within the European Union.  We are in favour of having a stability pact that looks at the wider employment and economic implications for Europe, a pact that contain spending and borrowing at reasonable prudent levels, but which allows countries to take the necessary steps to prevent their economies slipping into recession. We should not be trying to tie the hands of national governments in managing their own economies. Any stability pact that emerges from the Ecofin Council that does that will be unacceptable not only to this House, but I believe will be unacceptable to the  15  national parliaments within the European Union.  On  16  October the European Commission agreed on the proposal for a stability pact to ensure budgetary discipline during the third phase of EMU. What was expected to be a fiscal straightjacket, fully inspired by irrational fears of fiscal irresponsibility rather than rational economic thinking, turned into a more reasonable, albeit still partly unsatisfactory instrument, to respond to a legitimate need for budgetary discipline amongst Member States in a forthcoming monetary union. By avoiding quantifying significant negative annual real growth in the definition of exceptional and temporary circumstances, whose recognition allows temporary suspension of the obligation of compliance with the budget deficit criterion, the Commission refused to deprive Member States of the required budget flexibility to act promptly and effectively against significantly declining growth.  I commend the European Commission for having refused to tie the hands of Member States. I hope after the vote in this House tomorrow the Commission will maintain its position. I have great doubts however about whether the Ecofin Council will maintain the position proposed by the European Commission. I hope that if this Parliament votes to have a much more general definition tomorrow, combined with the views of the European Commission, then the Ecofin Council will ensure that it does not have a prescriptive definition when it comes to some of these issues associated with the stability pact.  We have to realise that if you have a Member State that suffers from a fall in its real GDP of  1   in a given year, going inevitably handinhand with increasing unemployment, raising unemployment benefit expenditure and falling tax revenues, in such a difficult situation any country would witness a rapidly deteriorating budget deficit of several percentage points likely to push it over the  3   deficit ceiling, thus making it excessive. Even in such a difficult case, if the countrys first priority was to fight a rising deficit, what would then happen is that it would be unable to take the steps to deal with the unemployment problem and the problem of the decline in its economy.  We cannot have that sort of straightjacket placed on Member States. We cannot put economies in the European Union in that position and I do not believe that national parliaments will accept it. We have to accept that over  90   of Europes economy relies on the European market providing for powerful transmission mechanisms and spillover effects between Member States. You could end up, if you accept the Waigel proposal with a large European recession, and in all probability with the larger Member States affected first. The big Member States would be attacked by the measures that we might put in place at the Dublin Summit Meeting.  What I want to say to the PresidentinOffice of the Ecofin Council is yes, have a stability pact but have a stability pact that takes account of economic growth. Yes, we want to have prudent spending and prudent borrowing. We want to make sure that Member States do not undermine the single currency when it is created, but be realistic about this. Do not create a mechanism that is unnecessary and which in the future could push Europe into a deep recession. The European Parliament will not accept that, Member States will not accept that, and of course, most importantly, the people of Europe will condemn us if we bring that into operation.
3223682 author: Amy LaCourt:  Mr President, I would like to remark that one Member of this House, Mr Goldsmith, who rarely favours us with his presence in debates on economic matters or indeed any matters at all, has said with huge media coverage that Europe is sleepwalking into EMU. I consider that to be a gross insult to this House, to all the rapporteurs, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, to the President of Ecofin and to President Santer and the Commission.  I would perhaps rather describe our progress as zigzagging, because if you look at the statements that were made, five States were said to be eligible, then it was four and recent coverage has suggested only two. I would like to congratulate Ireland on having become the tiger economy of Europe and of being able to qualify. Now my Group and my party in Scotland is in favour of EMU. We consider it absurd to have a single market without the accompanying single currency.  I have the speaking time of Mr Sainjon who was taken ill, and I have agreed to say one or two things on his behalf. He wants to see a single currency working to create employment, and Europe must concentrate its efforts on meeting this objective. The euro must be regarded as the engine driving economic and social progress. He says it represents three things for Europe today. It will help to consolidate peace in our continent and among our peoples, of course any government moving in the right direction should be able to join, and we must watch that we do not overvalue the euro and so destroy a lot of our aims.  All the reports are excellent. Starting with Mr Metten, I like the confident note in his report. He is confident that at the third stage we will start with a sufficient number of Member States. He also points out that an arithmetical application of the criteria is not possible, and if applied there would not be a sufficient number. In his explanatory statement he points out we could either do this with a big bang or we could do it in the way we are, converging first and then creating the Union.  So we come to the need for flexibility which other speakers have mentioned. This changes. For instance, Denmark, which meets the criteria, has an interest rate  1   higher than some states that do not meet the criteria. So it looks as if we still have some questions to be answered with regard to exactly what flexibility means. When is a decline in deficit substantial? When is a debt sufficiently diminishing? What is a satisfactory pace? Is there any limit to flexibility? If we take Belgiums debt as being twice the permitted or suggested amount, would there ever be any limit to be imposed or are we just going to say if we are moving consistently and continuously in the right direction the state can qualify? Is there any threat to the date of  1  January?  I would like to congratulate Mr Christodoulou on taking on board the economic aspects, the quest for job creation. That was not always the attitude when I lodged amendments to that effect a year ago, but the groups seem to have come round to that.  With regard to the stability pact, I have a question for the Commission. Are they going to make proposals for the surveillance of the outs ? Are we going to treat Britain with an optout in the same way as other outs who want to get in? If Britain does not want to get in and uses the optout, which I deplore, are they in the same position? How many years will the surveillance obligation to report annually continue?  I agree with Mr Donnellys speech in its entirety and particularly his plea that we do fall into the trap of the proposed German straitjacket.  I would like to congratulate Mr Herman on his passionate speech and on his need to inform, prepare and reassure. Is it not deplorable that in the State I belong to there is almost no attempt to inform? They seem to have opted out of that obligation. I would like to again repeat a point I have often made about public acceptability of this new currency. I suggest and cling to the idea that one side of the note and coin should be similar to the existing issuing notes that are issued by banks. That would go a long way to make the public feel that this was their currency.  In Hoppenstedt, which follows on Metten, he repeats many of the demands and expresses his regrets at some of the statements that are being made that States have to make savings because of Maastricht, that the European ideal has been undermined. Mr Harrison I thought made his paper very clear and come to life when he emphasized the need for a policy mix between centralized monetary policy and decentralized economic and employment policies. He mentions in his explanatory statement the rather bad example that followed German unification when a wrong mix of policies caused great hardship indeed. Mr Harrison explained his report very clearly.  On the doomandgloom side of loss of jobs, I wish the people who talk about the loss of jobs would tell us how exactly the jobs are going to be lost. They say this so often as if it is a fact. The media in Britain say it all the time. Will there not in fact be extra jobs? One speaker talked about the need for training. There will be the need for computer adjustment, certainly at the beginning there will be some extra jobs. So would we please pin those critics down.  For exporters, and my country Scotland exports six times as much per head as most other countries, the markets will be more calculable and comparable the tourists will benefit and we will remove exchange costs of ECU  25  billion.
5856604 author: Frederic Finlayson:  Mr President, I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Fabra Valls, for their excellent work during this year. As Mr Wynn has indicated, this has not been a simple year; indeed, it has been a bruising and difficult year, because we basically had the choice of maintaining those agreements which we have entered into as a Parliament, including the interinstitutional agreement, which, I am delighted to see as a result of our debates today and our procedure on Thursday, will be confirmed, or voting for funds on the transEuropean networks or research and development which would take us outside the limits. We as a group have always maintained that we should uphold those agreements which we have entered into.  Of course we would have an unsatisfactory budget procedure, I would say, Mr Wynn, because once you have actually agreed in principle to have an austere budget, there is very little to discuss because we are all going to be within a similar margin for manoeuvre  both Parliament and the Council. In this particular year there are three points I would like to make in summarizing the point of view of the European Peoples Party.  Firstly, we have begun to refine the way in which we use the reserve to achieve Parliaments aims. We have done this in terms of information policy, where we have seen a remarkable changearound by the Commission in its willingness to come to some radical decisions on how information policy should be developed. We still have not quite got to the end of that process. We are supporting that  25   of the funds should remain in the reserve so that in the institutional working group, which is now well established both for general and specific reasons, we are able to come to a proper decision between Parliament and Commission as to how the funds should be operated.  Similarly, in terms of small and mediumsized businesses, tourism and DG XXIII, we have also seen some change once funds are put in the reserve by Parliament on first reading and we come to the second reading. It may be coincidental perhaps from the Commissions point of view, but so far as Parliament is concerned, it is unlikely that decision would have been taken so quickly had we not also put funds in the reserve. Again, we are getting a better use of the reserve. Obviously the third example, Turkey, is a much more sensitive question, and we have not yet been able to get the right balance of confidence between the institutions: between, on the one hand, the Commissions view of the code of conduct and therefore its desire to have its freedom of manoeuvre and, on the other, that of Parliament, which does not yet have the confidence that the Commission will do what we have asked it to do.  This is the first point  that we will continue to use this instrument to be able to ensure that Parliaments priorities are properly asserted in the budget and legislative process. Secondly, this leads me to the linkage which we have not really made in this budget process, which is in the Intergovernmental Conference. We should now be able to see some progress in the Intergovernmental Conference, where the Council can see that it has a responsible, rational and disciplined partner in the budgetary process with which to implement the priorities of the European Union. I would expect some progress to be made in the elimination of the distinction between obligatory and nonobligatory expenditure, once we come to a conclusion, either in Amsterdam or a little bit later next year in the Intergovernmental Conference.  Lastly there is the point that if the European Council is going to continue to put out statements that it wishes to top up money for the transEuropean networks, or wishes to be able to put more money into research and development and then does not provide the new money to go with that, then obviously we are going to continually find ourselves in the kind of situation in which we found ourselves in this budgetary process. So I would strongly endorse the point in Mr Brinkhorsts resolution  indeed it is an EPP suggestion  that we should have a fiche financire , a financial statement, from the European Council at every single point at which it makes use of funds, so that we know where the funds are meant to be coming from. Otherwise, I think this House will find that when it comes to the revision of the financial perspectives, enlargement and all these bigger questions which we are heading for, then there can only be trouble in future between the two arms of the budgetary authority.
4295514 author: Katarina Cameron:  Mr President, if anyone ever doubted that a small Member State of the European Union could perform a worldclass act then the Irish presidency has dispelled that doubt. The Irish Government has performed what many people thought was an impossible task: they have produced a draft treaty in time for the Dublin II summit meeting this weekend. Not only have they produced a draft paper, but it is lucid, persuasive and has a clear eye to making the case for closer European integration in a language and style which is accessible to and has resonance for the peoples of the European Union. My group congratulates the Irish presidency on its very significant efforts.  This Parliament must now spend some time examining and analysing the  140  pages which make up the draft proposals, which will be formally presented to our government leaders on Friday, taking account, of course, of the outcome of that meeting. I want it to be clear that any response which my group makes today must be seen as an immediate political response to the document. I make it without prejudice to the detailed critique which will follow in the coming weeks.  Having welcomed the publication of the draft, can I urge subsequent presidencies to continue the most appealing form in which it is presented? The Irish presidency has clearly learned the lessons of the dbacle of the public debate on the Maastricht Treaty. With each suggested change in the Treaty there is a justification written by way of introduction and, above all, written in plain, easytounderstand language. Gone is the stiff, turgid, legalistic approach of Maastricht. Socialists welcome and applaud this, which will inevitably help the public understanding of just why changes are required and suggested.  My group wants, as well, to welcome the positive elements in the draft proposal. We specifically draw attention to the inclusion of an employment chapter which aims to give the same political priority to the issue of job creation in the European Treaty, as the Maastricht Treaty gave to EMU and a single currency. Of course we want to ensure that this competence has real bite and is not mere pious words. Frankly we have had enough of them already. But we are encouraged that the concept of the separate chapter on employment is clearly established and enjoying overwhelming majority support.  We particularly welcome the allembracing definition of nondiscrimination. This is as we want it and is a strong statement of intention that this European Union will not suffer or tolerate those who purvey the politics of hate. This Parliament has led the campaign against the resurgence of racism and antisemitism. It would be a most powerful first positive message for reform of the Treaty if the Dublin II summit were to reach immediate agreement on this new competence, designed to demonstrate that our Europe respects citizens or residents whether white or black, Christian, Jew or Muslim. We have learnt the lessons of our history and we believe all decentthinking people in Europe share that desire for tolerance with us.  Mr PresidentinOffice, I am sure you would expect us, in this House, to express a balanced view of the draft proposals, and I will not disappoint you. In expressing considerable criticism of what is not in the draft, I want to make clear that this is not to denigrate the considerable feat of actually producing it. It is rather in sadness as we recognize that, despite the energy which has gone into it, the draft treaty in omission demonstrates the difficulties with which the Union is faced.  First and foremost, my group sincerely regrets that there is no mention of institutional reforms in any depth, so necessary to make the Union work more effectively and efficiently. What is it that has determined the need for this IGC? It is not some overweening urge to put each country through a further tortuous debate on just where Europe is going, not a slavish devotion to an unthinking dash to Eurofederalism, as Eurosceptics would have us believe, but rather, the absolute imperative to enlarge the Union to bring in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and ultimately the Baltic States. It is nothing short of the fundamental bedrock underlying the lives of millions of our people; that is, peace and stability on our continent. If we are serious then we have to ensure that our Union is ready for enlargement. That means making sure that the institutional issues which govern decisionmaking in the Union are streamlined and made ready for a bigger Union in the relatively near future.  That the Council is unable to demonstrate any serious degree of consensus on this issue nine months after the opening of the IGC is a cause of great concern.  On issues of practical importance to our citizens there is scant mention: the environment, public services, the real development of European citizenship and greater openness and transparency. We suspect that the ambiguity which currently blights the second and third pillars in terms of democratic accountability will be increased rather than lessened by proposals in the draft paper. Not only is the right of democratic control, which is exercised by elected parliaments throughout the world, not further extended in the draft, but the logic of the text would appear to weaken Parliaments budgetary rights on the second pillar on a common foreign and security policy and, by the proposals for a hybrid arrangement on the third pillar on home and justice affairs, confuses rather than clarifies and simplifies decisionmaking processes.  We hope that at Dublin our governments can come together and seek a higher level of ambition for the European Union and its future.
9177776 author: Nancy Reid:  Mr President,  Die Politik ist keine exakte Wissenschaft  . Please forgive my German accent, but I would not dare quote Bismarck in English. If politics were an exact science, the United States of Europe would already exist as the logical culmination of the aims of the Founding Fathers of the European Union, providing security and prosperity for its citizens and exercising a benign but powerful influence on the world stage. But, regrettably, politics is not exact and we are here today discussing a measure which is more practical than ideal.  The proposals of the Irish presidency under the title Outline for a draft revision of the Treaties are the distillation of views and opinions gathered from a myriad of discussions, debate and seminars at political and official level with academics, NGOs and social partners, a process that began under the Italian presidency and gathered momentum during the last six months. The document should therefore command a consensus if it is an accurate reflection of these views. In theory, nobody should be against it but I suspect there is much disparity in some areas, especially under the third pillar. Therefore, consensus may be difficult to achieve.  The principle of consensus, however, should never mean surrender and I commend the presidency for pushing for real progress in such areas as Treaty status for the fight for employment and growth, the fight against drugtrafficking, with extension of the remit and powers of Europol, measures to combat serious crime, extension of the CFSP, simplification of decisionmarking and transparency, fundamental rights, the sustainable environment and freedom to travel.  The first priority  the plight of the unemployed  is also our first priority. The European Council must again address this issue in Dublin. Whole communities in our countries are being destroyed because of widespread unemployment. A wholehearted response is required. I believe that Dublin should provide us with a separate and comprehensive statement of the European Council strategy to strengthen the fight for growth and employment.  Politicians can be broadly divided into pragmatists and idealists. The pragmatists are those who know what can be attained and have to endure the frustration when this is less than they would like. The Irish presidency and members of governments generally find themselves in this category.  I have no doubt that the Irish presidency is only too well aware that its draft document is embarrassingly weak on the vexed question of the veto and qualified majority voting. I know it is in full sympathy with the views of this Parliament but it sees the draft document as a realistic or pragmatic acknowledgement of what is politically attainable at this stage.  When to debate a sensitive topic  when to make it an issue  is always a fine judgement for the pragmatic politician but for politicians who can afford the luxury of being idealists  and many in this Parliament are in this category  there are no such inhibitions. Our job is always to pursue the unattainable goal, dragging our pragmatic colleagues with us as far as possible towards this goal. That is why we must call for the end of the veto. The veto is a roadblock on our route to Union. If it is not removed our great movement will come to a halt because any one Member State can say: thus far and no further. If this happens Europe will stagnate and eventually fall apart as Member States pursue their own individual aspirations, no longer having a common goal.  We are approaching  if we are not already there  the watershed of the history of the Union. Those who do not believe in the federal Union foreseen by our Founding Fathers must consider whether they are entitled to bring this movement to a halt and ultimate collapse or whether they themselves should go. It is perhaps a pity that this draft of the Irish presidency does not pose this question for it needs to be faced and, I would say, sooner rather than later. I believe, therefore, with the European Parliament, that the veto should go, and should go quickly.  The democratic deficit must also be ended. We want to see an extension of codecision and a more democratic and effective third pillar.  I also endorse the use of qualified majority voting to achieve an effective common foreign and security policy, and the incorporation of the WEU under the European pillar. To those who would say that this is an unreasonable approach  and there will be some  let me quote the wisdom of a fellow Irishman, George Bernard Shaw. The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. I would like to think that this Parliament is firmly on the side of the unreasonable man.  Let me conclude by warmly thanking the Irish presidency for the courtesy it has extended to the Groups of this Parliament and to Parliament itself and for taking on board the concerns of this Parliament. I sincerely wish it all success in Dublin and in its concluding days.
2972348 author: Sarah Bauer:  Madam President, one minute to pay tribute to the respect and esteem in which my group holds Klaus Hnsch as President of this Parliament is really not enough. I want to say, first of all, that last night in the Socialist Group one of your distinguished predecessors, Enrique Baron, said in discussion with one of your potential successors, that each presidency has its own style. You have had your own style, Mr President, and you have had style.  The Socialist Group who nominated you, Mr President, are proud of you. You have brought great credit on this Group and we will welcome you back with open arms in a few weeks as a VicePresident of our Group. We thank you very much for all the work you have done, for all you have stood for.  I cannot go through all the things that have happened in your presidency but you, Mr President, have never been afraid to take decisions. You have never been afraid to advance radical proposals provided you believed that they were in the best interests of our Parliament and would reflect well on Europe. You have been a strong, determined, radical President committed to bringing our Parliament closer to its people. We know that in this House that will not always make you very popular, but we respect the fact that you have achieved much in trying to bring this Parliament closer to its people.  I repeat, we in the Socialist Group, and I am sure all of us in this House, are proud of you. I want particularly to recall one of the first innovations of your presidency: the Delorsstyle Question Time which all of us are now familiar with in this House. For those of you who actually believe the President had a secret list either in front of him or in his head, I can dispel that belief because if it was the case then I am sure the leader of the largest Group, and particularly his Group, would have been on that list. But I have to tell you I was the victim of not being on that list many times. I often felt, looking at the Presidents mischievous grin as he looked at me waving my hand, that I was a deliberate victim of this new system. But I do feel, however, and I think colleagues will agree, that has brought life to this House in a way that we very much appreciate. We thank you for that.  The sessions where we dealt with the ratification of the Commission President and the public hearings on the Commissioners brought this House to life politically in a way that it has hardly ever been before and set a very good standard for future ratifications of the European Commission.  This is not anywhere near what I would like to say and I will certainly pay tribute to our President, Klaus Hnsch, at a later time and in our own way in our Group, but I want to end by saying that there have been some very notable moments in this House during the last twoandahalf years. I remember in particular the visit of Franois Mitterrand, which you hosted during the last months of his life: that very moving moment when he said that he was a French patriot and that France was his country but Europe was Frances future, and the way in which you, President, held that meeting in your grasp and how moving it was. I remember as well the many tributes you have paid and the many speeches you have made particularly in solemn session and let me remind Members of this House of the one that for most of us is most striking, President, when you stood and spoke to us in memory of the bombing of Dresden. On that occasion, which was a hugely moving moment in this House, when you recalled your own personal reminiscences of that day, there were not many of us here that had a dry eye and I personally had a very great lump in my throat that day.  As indeed I did yesterday when you reminded us in this House  and let us remind people over there  that what we are fighting for and what you stood for and defended was the role this Parliament and this Europe can play in the defence of human rights, in the defence of democracy, in the defence of humanity all across this world.  President, you have been brilliant at that. We are proud of that. Thank you, President.
6770243 author: Helen LaCourt:  Mr President, there is a certain irony that this is the last debate of  1996  in this Chamber because at the end of  1996  the EU administration in Mostar also comes to an end and I rather suspect we may have to return to debating Mostar in the new year.  I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent and wideranging report. There are many lessons to be learned from the EU administration in Mostar. Most of them are political lessons. The main objective of this report was to look at budgetary and financial questions. But politics set the framework in which financial management can operate and what this report shows about the EU administration in Mostar is that there was a lack of clarity, a lack of coherence, a lack of consistency and a lack of clearlydefined objectives. That reveals to me the importance of reaching agreement in the intergovernmental conference on having a unit responsible for common foreign and security policy whose job it is to identify the longterm problems confronting the European Union and strategies for dealing with those problems and also personnel for dealing with these problems. As Mrs Mller has pointed out one of the problems was that Member States sent people off to Mostar without regard for whether they could do the job that was needed. That was one of the problems the administration had to face.  There was also clearly a lack of a clearlydefined line of command in Mostar. As Mrs Mller has also pointed out, every time the presidency changed so did the people responsible for Mostar in the Council of Ministers change. What we therefore need is somebody responsible for the foreign and security policy who would be the same person regardless of what the presidency is. That would enable us to have a clearer line of command. But most importantly, paragraph  9  of the resolution, highlights the fact that the pillar structure of the Maastricht Treaty has left huge gaps and areas where there are doubts about demarcation, about responsibility, about coordination. We really have to clarify in relation to EU external policy who does what, when and how, and who they are accountable to. Otherwise we will repeat the mistakes of Mostar.  We should also be drawing attention to Article J. 3  of the Maastricht Treaty which says once a common action has been agreed unanimously in the Council of Ministers, it is possible to use qualified majority voting to carry out that joint action. One of the problems in Mostar was that at one point it seemed that every decision, down to the buttons on the police uniform, were having to be referred back to the Council of Ministers for unanimous decision. You cannot operate this sort of administration on that basis.  Mrs Mller also made reference to the financing. You cannot finance an action by passing the hat round between Member States in the hope that they will come up with money, and more importantly, that they will come up with the money when they say they will come up with the money. Far too often money did not materialize. These sort of actions have to be financed out of the EU budget, which will then give the European Parliament its proper role as the authority of accountability.  There is no doubt that Mostar was successful in terms of physical reconstruction. I have been there and I have seen the extensive progress that was made but it was not successful in terms of political reconstruction. We must learn the lessons that are clearly set out in Mrs Mllers report. I personally have tremendous admiration for the work of the people on the ground. That admiration does not extend to the people they were responsible to.  I will finish by making reference to a famous book in Spanish which you will be familiar with, written by somebody quite closely connected to the man who may next be President of the European Parliament. It says peace was not possible. I would say to you in relation to Mostar that political reconstruction was not possible and it will not be possible until we identify very clearly who should do what, when they should do it and how they should do it. Let us hope we learn those lessons.
6167546 author: Alastair Brown:  Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to welcome the Prime Minister of Ireland, John Bruton, to this House today and take the opportunity of both thanking and congratulating him on the excellent work of the Irish Government during the six months it held the presidency of the European Union.  Ireland took over the presidency at a crucial time when the intergovernmental process was in the doldrums, when a concerted effort was needed to try to reestablish its momentum. Whilst my group may have very many criticisms of the draft treaty which came out of the Dublin II summit  and many of these will be aired by my groups specialists later in this debate  there is little doubt that the Irish commitment to and success in producing a draft Treaty covering many of the vital areas under consideration was a very considerable feat, especially given the very real differences which exist between the Member States of the Union on sensitive issues such as: flexibility and qualified majority voting; employment and the social dimension: the third pillar and the fight against drugs; international crime and terrorism; the development of a common foreign and security policy; and enlargement of the Union and much, much more.  Ireland also took over the presidency at a time when the timetable for economic and monetary union demanded action, a time when the concept of EMU was under attack in many Member States and when it would have been simpler and much more comfortable simply to ease off the throttle and wait for the following presidencies to take up the challenge.  I want to pay tribute to Ruairi Quinn who has been the PresidentinOffice of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers under the Irish presidency and who was determined not to take the easy option but rather to succeed with his agenda, to reach agreement on the stability pact, to finalize the legal arrangements for the Euro and the structure of the new EMS, all of this at a time when the Irish presidency was engaged with a heavy timetable of Council meetings, with the vexed questions of the budget of the Union for  1997  and at the same time conducting an ambitious series of meetings with this Parliament. I pay tribute to the work of Mr Mitchell, who is here this morning, in that respect. The presidency also met with the committees and political groups in this Parliament, while of course governing Ireland and engaging in the tortuous process of seeking real peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  Perhaps it is to Ireland and its buoyant economy, its expanding potential and its burgeoning confidence that we should look when we ask ourselves why one of the Unions smallest countries should have performed so well in the presidency of the Union. Unlike its big neighbour, Irelands government  and when we listen to Mr Bruton this morning we understand why  understands the European perspective. It has engaged itself in the processes of the European Union, not just in a very practical sense but through an intellectual examination of Irelands future prospects and place in the world. That was well demonstrated by Mr Brutons comments.  I want to turn my attention for a moment to the foreign policy agenda of the Union in the past six months. Ireland has exercised a measured and thoughtful role in this most difficult of areas as well. In this Parliament we have congratulated Foreign Minister Dick Spring for his intelligent and sensitive handling of Europes role in the Middle East peace process. Once again in contrast to some of the Heads of State in the Union, the Irish presidency operated with a maturity that brought credit on the Union and we thank the Prime Minister for that as well.  We on this side of the House believe that your presidency has been a success. That is not to say of course that we agree with every decision or every statement and Mr Bruton would not expect us to. Far from it, but we are able to see that the Irish presidency was conducted efficiently and effectively in staunch defence of European objectives and with integrity. It has laid the grounds for the Dutch presidency and demonstrated that Europe can play a role internationally. Such a role is crucial at this moment. The PresidentinOffice will recollect that the European Union played a facilitating role in the Middle East peace process at the Barcelona Conference which launched the Unions Mediterranean policy. As I am sure we all do, I welcome the signing of the Hebron Agreement today.  Given the present tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the opportunity now exists for the Union to demonstrate its facilitating role again by using the arena of the Mediterranean Conference to bring together all those involved in the current tension  Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, all involved and committed to the Mediterranean process.  Shortly the Foreign Ministers, including that of Ireland, will meet in the context of the Mediterranean Conference to discuss security issues. I urge them and I hope you will urge them, as the outgoing presidency but part of the Troika of the European Union, to exercise their considerable diplomatic and political leverage to diminish both tension and the desperately dangerous arms race which has now gathered pace in the Eastern Mediterranean. We should be pursuing the item which has been on the agenda for the last two years of demilitarization on the island of Cyprus with as much strength and vigour as they are now pursuing the arms race in the Eastern Mediterranean.  In conclusion, the Irish presidency has laid a firm foundation for the succeeding presidencies on the IGC, on EMU and shown that sensitive diplomacy which recognizes what Europe can do and the role it can play in the present world is something we have to offer. We thank the presidency for that.
1610002 author: Annette Bush:  Firstly, Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your election and wish you every success during your term of office. Cuirimse cad mile filte roimh Taoiseach na hEireann agus Aire Gnothai na hEorpa ata anseo chun deire oifiguil a chuir le Uachtaranacht Eireann don Comhphobail.  I warmly welcome the outgoing PresidentinOffice of the Council and his European Affairs Minister Gay Mitchell on their formal visit to the European Parliament to bring to a conclusion Irelands presidency of the Union. We are all very pleased at the success of Irelands presidency. To the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government and the many hundreds of civil servants who have been involved we say a very sincere thank you and we are very proud of you for a job well done.  I am also pleased to say that the summit in Dublin was one of the more successful summit meetings in recent years. Solid progress was recorded on the four major priorities listed by the Irish presidency at the beginning of its term of office and approved by Parliament. which were the single currency, the fight against crime and drugs, the Intergovernmental Conference and the tackling of unemployment. The establishment of a single currency in less than two years time is now firmly on course; the stability and growth pact ensures that the financial markets, investors and the general public can all be confident that the Euro will be a stable currency and will not be subject to fluctuations because of shortterm policies being pursued by one or more governments within the new currency zone.  I welcome the progress made in Dublin on strengthening cooperation between European Union countries in the fight against organized crime and international drug smuggling. The illegal drug trade is responsible for a great deal of misery in each of our countries and crime against people and property to fund drug habits means that large numbers of our citizens are living in constant fear for their personal safety. Those ultimately responsible for supplying the illegal drugs now available in communities throughout the Union have long operated on an international basis and effective action to curb their activities also demands a coordinated international response.  The Union should allocate resources from its annual budget to intercept smugglers as the drugs are introduced to the Union, to control the distribution of substances used in the manufacture of drugs within the Union and to investigate the moneylaundering activities of the drug barons. The draft revision of the Treaties which was presented to the Dublin Summit by the Intergovernmental Conference represents a solid basis from which to proceed to the final and most controversial stage of the negotiations on a new Treaty.  The agreement at the summit on the draft revision of the Treaties was a major breakthrough and a special word of thanks is owed to those involved, in particular the government representative Noel Dorr, for the leading role he played in this respect. One of the issues still to be decided in these negotiations concerns the number of European Commissioners to be appointed in the future. It is vitally important to preserve the political legitimacy of the Commission in all Member States and in the eyes of each national electorate. In the long run this will only be possible if each country has a full seat in the College of Commissioners.  A second institutional issue still to be decided concerns the future operation of the presidency of the Council of Ministers. It has been suggested that the small European countries lack the resources and the ability to undertake the onerous task of presiding over the affairs of the Union and that the present system of rotating the sixmonth presidencies should be abolished. Well, the record of the Irish presidency during the last six months and in particular during the Dublin Summit, like the previous Irish presidency, demonstrates clearly that smaller Member States can organize efficient and successful presidencies and in many cases can broker agreements which larger Member States are unable to achieve during their presidencies. The experience of the last six months suggests that there is a strong case for preserving the present system of rotating the Council presidency.
4663826 author: Jennifer Whittacker:  Mr President, Council meetings in the last few months have probably had the most important agendas for several years, dealing with three areas in fisheries management: first, the size of the EU fishing fleet under the MAGP; the new regulations for technical measures proposed by the Commission; and satellite transponders, an important aspect of the overall control programme. In addition, the annual TACs were decided. These meetings afforded a rare opportunity to take decisive action to rectify the dangerous situation of the EU fisheries. Unfortunately the Council did not have the courage to make the difficult decisions which need to be made.  On the MAGP, everybody admits that the EU fishing fleets are too large. Even the fishing industry itself says that there is overcapacity and that reductions are necessary. However, the Council continues to resist the idea. It currently seems to be attempting to turn MAGP from a programme to reduce fishing fleet capacity by decommissioning, scrapping etc., into a programme to limit the fishing efforts which the fleets are allowed to make. This amounts to a fundamental reorientation of the goal of the programme and one which, in our opinion, is bound to fail. There are several reasons why this failure is inevitable. I will mention just two.  First, fishing vessels are built to fish, so fishing vessel owners are not going to be happy with their vessels sitting idle and losing money. They will exert pressure on politicians to allow them to go fishing to try and make some money. The extent of the pressure which can be put on politicians is known to us all and can be seen in the results of the annual Council meeting where TACs are decided. So even if the Council was able, in its wisdom, to accept a programme to limit fishing effort, that would not end the story, for there would be everincreasing demands from the industry to allow more fishing.  Secondly, such a programme would be extraordinarily difficult to monitor or control. Last year I was rapporteur for the report on the CFP monitoring system. You will recall that fisheries control is the responsibility of the Member States, not the Commission. The basic conclusion of the review conducted by the Commission was that the control programmes in the Member States were totally inadequate and in dire need of improvement. No country had a programme which was sufficient in all areas. It was interesting that the Commission recorded that several countries had failed to meet targets in the statistics on the size and capacity of the national fleets. Instances were found where vessels were larger in reality than was actually indicated in the national registry of vessels.  So I would pose the question: how can we be confident that a programme to control the fishing effort of a large and powerful fleet would be successful? We have not even managed to control the amount of fish which is landed, and that is a far simpler task.  One agreement has been reached on how much capacity is to be reduced. Another aspect which is important is what capacity is to eliminated. We must ensure that the vessels which remain in the fleets are those which are the least destructive to the marine environment. This would have longterm beneficial consequences for both the fish stocks and for the fishermen.  A final matter which gets very little attention is what is done with the vessels. EU fleets are already active in many oceans around the world and often cause considerable damage. Considering the size of the other fleets in the world, there is not a great deal of room in other areas to which these vessels can go without causing problems. The decommissioning schemes put in place must ensure that the MAGP does not simply transfer the problem to other parts of the world. Europe must not be allowed to export its excess capacity.  In short, the Greens consider that a rigorous programme of fleet reduction accompanied by compensation for the fishermen thus affected is a fundamental prerequisite for resolving the current crisis. The technical measures are all about trying to increase the selectivity of EU fishing practices. This involves not only the juveniles of commercially important, targeted species but also other species that are not wanted by fishermen. The fact that the FAO estimates that, on a global basis, one tonne of fish is thrown away for every three tonnes that is kept shows that this is a very serious problem. The Commission has proposed a number of progressive changes in the current technical measures including square mesh panel, increase in mesh size, grates or grids to filter out the shrimp catches and others. Once again, the Council is shillyshallying, working on a compromise version which will weaken the Commission proposal.  The fishing industry is being held accountable for the damage it wreaks on the marine community. The proposals of the Commission are a significant step along the path towards a more responsible approach to fishing activities. The Council seems bent, unfortunately, on ignoring wider public opinion in Europe and around the world, which is in favour of a more careful and precautionary approach to fishing, and is choosing to bow to the pressure of the fishing industry.
3774470 author: Frederic Corless:  Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes and endorses the report and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE. This Parliament is today demonstrating that we take our role of monitoring and controlling the unelected institutions of the European Union very seriously. This is the first time that the powers given to us in the Maastricht Treaty to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration under the auspices of a committee of inquiry have been used. My group wants to pay tribute to those colleagues who have been engaged in the committee of inquiry. They have worked hard to identify and expose the tragic series of events which have devastated the beef industry across Europe, ruined the livelihoods of so many farmers, rural workers and people engaged in the ancillary food business and, worst of all, has led to debilitating illness and death for some of our fellow citizens and put so many others at risk.  I wish to make clear that for my group at all times the paramount concern has been the health of the people of the European Union.  The work of the committee of inquiry has demonstrated unequivocally that the blame for the BSE crisis lies fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the current British Government.  It was its singleminded, blind, ideological commitment to deregulation that led to a catalogue of disastrous decisions on which BSE evolved.  (Applause) My group has long believed that a simple commitment to deregulation is as outmoded and dangerous a concept as is a simple commitment to regulation. What is needed is appropriate regulation: regulation to protect the health of the public and regulation to secure the safety of consumers is, in our view, necessary in a single market.  The BSE tragedy is a sad and dramatic example of what can happen when the health of the public and the safety of consumers is sacrificed on the altar of business expediency and profitenhancement.  (Applause) The British Government is to blame not just for the impact in Britain but because, by its mismanagement of the crisis, far from containing BSE in Britain it allowed its contaminated animal foodstuffs and infected calves to continue to enter the market and food chains in the rest of Europe. This really was negligence of the worst sort. I am confident that all decentthinking British people know that if such games had been played with their health and safety by any other government in the European Union they would be unforgiving. The British tabloid media would do well to ponder on that fact before they indulge in any further xenophobia on this issue.  (Applause) The sight last night of the British Minister of Agriculture, Mr Douglas Hogg, being saved from a motion of no confidence in the House of Commons on his mishandling of the BSE crisis by a disreputable political fix with the Ulster Unionist Party really beggars belief! If, as we are assured, beef from Northern Ireland and other specified herds in Britain has not been infected in the same way as other beef in Britain, why was it not acknowledged months ago, thereby saving Northern Irish farmers from the catastrophic financial consequences of recent months? Why is it that the British Government only agrees to pursue socalled special measures when it faces a motion of no confidence in the House of Commons? It is this kind of cynical, opportunist behaviour which destroys confidence in Britain and the rest of Europe and demonstrates that the British Government does not put health and consumer safety  let alone economic good sense  at the top of its agenda.  Mr Douglas Hogg, the hapless Agriculture Minister, refused to come and give evidence to our committee of inquiry, despite the fact that all the governments in the Union  including the British Government  had given an undertaking that they would support the work of Parliaments committee of inquiry. Last night in the House of Commons Mr Hogg said that it would be an abnegation of British sovereignty for him to give evidence to us here. He is one of those who argues that sovereignty in a democracy rests in its parliament. I am one of those who believes that sovereignty resides in the hands of the people.  (Applause) However, the Council cannot hide from criticism in this affair. It succumbed to pressure from the British Government; it watered down Commission proposals in the Agriculture Council and generally used the elite club of the Council to look after national interests rather than those of the people of the Union. It reinforces the view of my group that the Council, when acting as a corporate body, hides behind the members individual democratic legitimacy and acts together in a secretive and unacceptable way.  I want to say now to the President of the Commission that this was a disaster waiting to happen. The European Commission is culpable: it was not as if the Commission had not been warned that its structures and decisionmaking on food safety and public health were seriously flawed. As long ago as  1989  in the Raftery report this Parliament stated:  If we want a genuine single market for food then we must establish a genuine, independent, strong and open regulatory body which will be seen to put the interests of consumers above those of producers, processors, distributors and the catering industry.  Yet again, in March  1992 , in my report on the reform of the Scientific Committee for Food this Parliament said:  The process of achieving a satisfactory scientific base for matters relating to food safety will be judged by Europes consumers according to whether it is sufficiently independent, transparent and effective. In that report Parliament demanded a single unit in the European Commission to deal with food under the auspices of the consumer policy service, a common food policy, an independent scientific committee for food, proper consumer representation on that committee, transparency in the appointments made to the committee and proper consideration of the public interest in areas of food and consumer safety. How much more could this Parliament have done to demonstrate that European decisionmaking in food safety was in a mess? The litany of shambolic decisionmaking, lack of accountability and evasiveness shown by the Commission and its officials throughout the BSE saga has left the Commission weakened and vulnerable. So, sadly, it has taken a crisis of this magnitude to create the conditions for change.  If the President of the Commission is to be believed, then change we shall have, and we welcome his statement. But we are not content with promises. That is why in our resolution to wind up this debate we commit ourselves to watching very carefully just what action the Commission takes to fulfil its promises made here today by its President. If the reforms are not genuine, appropriate or fast enough to deal with the recommendations of the committee of inquiry, then my group will join with others in tabling a motion of censure on the Commission at an appropriate time in the months before or during November of this year.  Finally, my group will not support the motion of censure on the European Commission before this House today. We do not consider it an effective political strategy to censure this Commission before it has had the opportunity to put its own house in order. We are interested in a serious attempt to reform in the interests of public health. Furthermore, we are convinced that a successful motion of censure at this stage would simply lead to an institutional crisis which would last for months and not do one single thing to strengthen public health or consumer protection at European level.  (Applause) There are those who consider that the publicity and chaos which would accompany the dismissal of the Commission would somehow cleanse the system. My group does not believe that to be the case. That the President of the Commission has come here today to set out before this Parliament a package of reforms which, if carried through, should go some way to really cleansing the system, is a tribute to those who have worked so hard in the committee of inquiry and a measure of the effect which this Parliament, if it takes its powers seriously, can achieve.  The committee of inquiry identified the faults and the reforms necessary to end those faults. It is now our political responsibility in this House to see through those reforms to completion, and we intend to do so.  (Loud applause)
2003599 author: Lynne Jones:  Mr President, Members of Parliament, I must say that I am rather disconcerted by this debate.  First of all, may I remind you that this plan was presented to Parliament on the  3 rd November  1995 . You must have examined it in depth, as you presented to me a report on the priorities in February  1997 ! So, my dear friends, let us be serious! Mr. Pimenta, this plan is presented under my name and I dare hope that the DirectorGeneral has not betrayed me. If you think that he has done so, why did you not say so? That really would be something that would call for disciplinary sanction. And this Parliament is apparently very fond of disciplinary sanctions. It would have been preferable, rather than to say it publicly today, to have the kindness to let the Commission know sooner.  I remember very well that before this document was submitted to the Council and to Parliament, Parliament had asked me not to present a detailed action plan, but a general outline of intervention policies. And if you read this document, you will see that the Commission has chosen as new priorities  as had never been done before  public services, financial services and the information society, and not products any more. You should have thought about these priorities! Because had I had to wait for your opinion before starting to do anything, since November  1995 , I would have done nothing until today. The debate should therefore be put back into context.  While waiting for you to reflect  since the  3 rd November  1995 !  the Commission, which had been asked to present a political plan, and not a plan of action which it worked out subsequently, presented a total of twelve proposals for directives concerning all the policies. Out of these twelve, three  i.e. one quarter  concern consumer policy, and more precisely access to justice, guarantees and consumption credit, which is being discussed this afternoon. After which, we presented you with the Green Paper on financial services, which will be debated shortly. Parliament then rejected the remote financial service, which we will present again. Everyone must therefore assume their responsibilities, as frankly, I hardly find it acceptable that the Commission is placed under accusation without recognition of everything it did in  1996 .  Mrs Jackson, if you think that the document is of no value because it does not mention BSE, your government and your party could have been of major help to this institution and to the Commission if it had informed us of what was going on. I would remind you that in  1996  the Commission formed the interservice group. We came up with three memorandums and the vademecum for consumers and the document  and maybe this is a detail you did not take on board  was presented in November  1995  and the crisis erupted in March.  (FR) Indeed, our relationship has always been loyal. Having said that, I do not wish to review everything we have done, for example with regard to the pursuit of legislative activities, indication of prices, comparative advertising, etc., but I find the comments I have heard here to be rather unfair, hardly generous and most inaccurate.  Moreover, I would like to say that I obtained the powers with regard to health control exactly a week ago. I would like to ask the Members of Parliament to be calm, as we will have to define together what it would be best to do. I do not have a miracle solution, Mr Whitehead, and I have already said that I would come and listen to you in the middle of March to find out what you are proposing. For example I believe that, bearing in mind my new responsibilities, it would be good for me to reexamine the Green Paper on food law  which was nearly ready  in the light of the changes in policies and priorities which have just been decided.  We have made a leap forward to the advantage of the consumer, but we should now set to work without excessive demagogy. That is a challenge we must take up together. I find it rather strange that I am asked today what are my decisions, my programmes, my ideas or  worse  those of the Commission regarding health, controls or the scientific committee. I received these powers only a week ago! I am not thinking so much of you, but of other interventions we have heard today.  Having said that, I will nevertheless reply to some more specific observations that have been made. As regards the Green Paper, it was ready in the interservice consultations, but I feel that in the new situation that has come to light since last week, it is my duty to reexamine it and see whether it is possible to push things a little further.  Mrs Kuhn, as regards baby food, one can always dream of revolution. This does not prevent current law from having limits. For as long as the treaty is not amended, the Commission is obliged to apply it as it is, and Mr Bangemann has started a proceeding against Germany for hindering free circulation. We must respect the rules, whether or not we like them, until we come to change them.  As regards the instructions, I hope that it is an exceptional case, but I am very willing to find out more, as I did not know about it. I do not wish to launch into a reply on a subject that I do not know, but I would like to learn more, in order to determine whether it is habitual practice or a particular case. As regards subsidies to organizations  I am returning to the last remark from Mr Pimenta and others  we have been reproached for distributing money without exactly knowing why, while we introduced a procedure for encouraging consumer organizations to work together on Community projects, and we tried not to grant operating subsidies any more, but only to support specific projects. I think we are now ready to publish in the Official Journal the result of our work, which has not been easy.  For southern European countries whose need is greatest, I myself sent a special adviser to the four countries, to meet all the consumer organizations, which are now in a position to make proposals. I would like action from the consumer associations, rather than to tell them myself what they should do. After a years work, we are in a position to start projects covering the four countries of Mediterranean Europe  Italy, Portugal, Greece and Spain  in order to reinforce a consumerism culture which is little developed in southern Europe.  As regards Article  129  A, as you know, six member countries have submitted an amendment to the CIG; we ourselves have presented an amendment to Article  129 . We hope in this way to be able to promote the reinforcement of the consumer and health policy.  I would now like to talk about food labelling. At this stage, I can only confirm what Mr President said yesterday in his speech  I quote:  I argue for the gradual introduction of a proper food policy and, in this context, I am in favour of compulsory and systematic labelling . The DG XXIV has already launched a consultation and study involving consumer associations to try to define jointly what would be clear, important and pertinent information, so that consumers are no longer flooded with a tide of information in which they are lost. For the moment, opinions largely conflict, and we will have to cut short as matters have reached political level, but we wanted to know at least the ideas of the consumer associations.  I do not know whether I have answered everyone. I had a comment for Mr Garosci on the subject of the Euro, which is one of our concerns and which we are trying to discuss with the appropriate Commissioner. I hope to have answered all the questions. On financial services, we will hold a debate now. I will therefore come back to it in detail with my colleague Monti. With regard to the new health controls, the meeting with Parliament is fixed for mid March.
4353220 author: Frederic Reid:  Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I want to welcome the Committee of Inquirys report and in particular to extend our congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr KellettBowman, for the excellent work he has done in producing the report before us today, and to Mr Tomlinson for the excellent way in which he has managed the Committee of Inquiry as its chair and for the excellent basis it gives us for the committees of inquiry in the future.  I should also congratulate the Commissioners, who, at the opening of this discussion, were certainly here in considerable numbers. I understand why one or two have drifted away, but I congratulate them on being here. Frankly, I have to say that I am disappointed that so very few Members of our House have stayed for what is a hugely important debate. Bearing in mind the turnout from the Commission, that needs to be said.  (Applause ) I look around the room and I recognize many Members from the Budget and Budget Control Committees who, of course, are committed to this cause of fighting fraud in the European Union; but we are all clear that fraud in the European Union and the reaction to it amongst the people of the Union are a major political issue for every Member of this House, not just for the Budget and Budget Control Members. I can only hope that those Members who are not here are sitting in their rooms reading the four volumes of the Committee of Inquirys report: I will be charitable. But I do think it ill behoves us to go home and rail about fraud in the European Union and talk about what we are doing about it, when we have this excellent Committee of Inquirys report and very few people are here to debate it.  This report demonstrates the European Parliament at its best. That is another reason why I regret that so few people are here. Here we have the European Parliament acting  for the first time really, because this was the first committee of inquiry established under the Maastricht Treaty  and the way in which it has performed, the way in which it has been conducted, the evidence that it has taken from people from the Commission, from Member States and from individuals, is a model of the way in which we would want committees of inquiry to work in the future. It has been deadly serious, combative certainly, and it has come forward with a range of proposals which do this House very great justice.  We should also be clear that what the Committee of Inquiry has exposed is the fact that the workings of the Single Market, the flagship policy of the European Union in recent years, have been exploited. This report is all about the Single Market, and most of our citizens would have assumed that the Single Market was actually working in a way that demonstrated that none of this could happen. There is clear evidence in this report of the failure of the Single Market at this moment, and of the need to tighten up. But let us remember that this was the first committee of inquiry set up by this House, and that when, at the Conference of Presidents under the chairmanship of Klaus Hnsch when he was still President of this House, we were looking to first use our new rights under the Maastricht Treaty, we wanted to be sure that the first committee of inquiry set up was one that dealt with an issue where we could have a real impact on public consciousness. Indeed Mr Martens initially came up with an idea that we should deal with fraud in the Union, and my group came up with the specific proposal about the area of fraud we should deal with. That has allowed us to demonstrate the truly effective nature of this House in its role to monitor, to examine, to investigate and to expose.  If there is any message that the media of the European Union ought to take away from this, it is that the European Parliament is exposing this fraud perpetrated against the institutions of the Union in terms of its budget and, of course, against the Member States of the European Union; that we are actually saying now to the governments and the parliaments of the Member States of the Union:  Please now get on and do what you are supposed to do and follow up this report . I hope the media will remember that and realize that it is not the European Parliament which is hiding or dissembling about fraud; we are exposing it and offering that analysis to the rest of the Union.  I think it is fair to say that over the time that the Committee of Inquiry sat, the mood certainly changed from one, not of hostility but of a certain degree of scepticism, to one of great support and help from the Commission and from other bodies.  The key recommendations  and I will close on this  in the Committee of Inquirys report are really about the nuts, the bolts, the gears and the wheels of the Single Market, and we have got to take note of them and make it work.  (Applause )
546852 author: Michael Bauer:  Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group. The first thing I want to do is to congratulate the two rapporteurs. Mr Tillich has been extremely kind in the way he has conducted his negotiations with the various groups and taken on board a lot of the suggestions, and Mr Tomlinson has done his usual exemplary work.  I have to say that the Tillich report is far too long, but that is not the fault of the rapporteur. Here we have a document which is a statement of our main priorities ahead of the Commissions PDB. It is not a resolution for the first reading, which a lot of people seem to think it is. However, when you have  135  amendments and  11  committees giving an input into that guideline you are bound to end up with something far more than the short, succinct document we all wanted.  You will notice that the text does not refer to an austerity budget, as it did last year. Nor does it explicitly state that the Parliament is prepared to help reduce expenditure. The reason is quite simple: last year Parliament went along with such a strategy in the hope that the Council would reciprocate by helping us solve some of the problems we have to live with, such as the problems of a legal base on a lot of the lines, and the problem of getting an agreement on classification and expenditure, to name but two.  Our group is not prepared to go down that route again. We are prepared to play our part in Parliament in getting the best budget we think is achievable and we are prepared to do that in good faith with the Council. We have to hope we will see the same good faith displayed by the Council. I say that because when you see our amendment to paragraph  3  you will understand our concerns.  The same feeling is displayed in paragraph  4  of the rapporteurs guidelines where we expect the normal dialogue we have with the Council to be improved. Mr Tomlinson said that when we go to the trialogue meetings to see the Council, it is a dialogue with the deaf. It is always the same procedure, whereby we make our points clear and the Council fails to respond. We have to hope that the experience over the past years with the Budget Council will now cease and that we will get a genuine dialogue in its place this time with the Ecofin Council. As Mr Tomlinson said, it is a pity that there is no one here from the Council to hear that.  I said that the guideline document was too long. It could have been made a lot more precise, and it could have been very concise by just consisting of paragraph  5 (a). If we had said paragraph  5 (a) we would have covered a lot of our priorities in one sentence, because that priority talks about combating unemployment. Parliaments budget should reflect Parliaments political priorities. The political priorities of my group are centred around job creation. It is job creation policies that we will support above all else. That is a message we want to get through to the Commission and to the Council for both the PDB and the draft budget.  I will now turn to the various categories. If the Council had been here I would have addressed the following point to it directly, and I hope the message gets back to it. If the ad hoc procedure which we talk about at length is to be adhered to, and if it is to be meaningful, we expect the Council to be honest about it. We want it to be honest with us and to say that it thinks it is a procedure that Council and Parliament have to go through to come to a conclusion about agricultural expenditure and the problems that exist therein. If it is going to go through the routine that it has gone through the last two years, which in the main is just a charade of going through the motions, knowing full well that at the end there will be no real conclusions, it should say so now. If it did so it would save everybody a lot of time. It would save us time, it would save our effort and we would not be making fools of ourselves by going through this joke of a procedure  which in my view is what it has been over the last two years. Therefore, I would hope that the Council can take it far more seriously and I hope the Commission will relay that to the Council.  While we are talking about Category  1 , I would say to the rapporteur that my group will be supporting Amendment No  11  tabled by Mr Rehder and others. However, there is a mistake in it and I would ask the services to correct it. It should have been tabled as an extra paragraph  10 (a) new, rather than replacing paragraph  9 . With that correction, our group will support it.  On Category  2 , our group has no plans to follow Parliaments action of last year which we voted against when ECU  1  billion in payments was removed from the structural funds. However, we are concerned about the problem of the gap between commitments and payments which is not helping job creation. It may well be the fault of the Member States, but we have to make it abundantly clear to those who are concerned about this that if we want to create cohesion, prosperity and jobs, the structural funds should be utilized to their fullest. We support paragraph  13 . It is only a pity that we need to be saying something like this within the guidelines.  On Category  3  our group has, as in the past, seen TENs and research and development as essential vehicles for future job creation, as it does when we give help to SMEs. Our amendment to paragraph  21  is to indicate that we are not simply talking about certain types of road when we talk about transEuropean networks; and the amendment to paragraph  22  is to clarify the position of the ECU  200 m for research and development. Also in Category  3 , not just under big programmes but on those smaller lines which Parliament considers to be priorities, such as youth, education and culture, we will also be giving our full support.  On external action, the Commission really does have to take heed of paragraphs  27  and  28 . Let me add:  We aint joking when we talk about PHARE and TACIS. We expect something far more concrete from the PDB. In our debates in the Committee on Budgets we have made it quite clear that the present objectives for PHARE cannot be continued, and the key words should be preaccession strategy . On Category  5  the text is quite explicit and I do not have to say anything on it.  Finally, on the Tomlinson report, you will see that it is extremely well prepared. Mr Tomlinson has involved as many people as possible. There is only one amendment in the plenary and I think that says it all.  I would like to thank our own SecretaryGeneral and the DirectorGeneral for Personnel and Finance for taking part in this debate, for being part of this gathering tonight and for showing such an interest in these guidelines. It is a darn sight more than can be said for the Council.  (Applause )
5763458 author: Michael Bush:  Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the four rapporteurs, Mr Wynn, Mr Dankert, Mr Blak and Mr Bsch for their reports. I want to address remarks to each of the players in the discharge procedure, first of all to Parliament.  Today is quite depressing. What we have in this Parliament, which ought to be taking seriously its responsibilities for discharge, is in effect a meeting of the Budget Control Committee with a few other Members. They are very welcome but there are far too few of them. It is depressing to consider the speed at which Members of Parliament rush to propose amendments for additional expenditure to the budget but do not begin to take seriously their responsibility for controlling it in terms of either quality or quantity. I hope that we can continue to hammer away internally at our own responsibilities.  Secondly, I want to say a few words to the Commission. They are words of encouragement along the lines of Mr Wynns report; encouragement by supporting the work of SEM  2000 . That is not just an encouragement in words. There has been a very practical manifestation of encouragement from the very valuable work of Mr Colom i Naval in supporting the SEM  2000  process. But of course in saying that to the Commission we are also acknowledging that there is a long way to go. I want to reiterate in that long way ahead one or two of the things that were said last year and, in particular, remind Commissioner Liikanen about the commitment he made at this stage last year to the policies of greater concentration; what he last year called policies of critical mass , so that we actually have more coherent, more easily identifiable and more readily controlled policies.  I want also to say a couple of words to the Court of Auditors. Another thing that depresses me this year was referred to by Mr FabreAubrespy, namely the statement of assurance. I am not quite sure that is the correct use of language because it seems to be an abuse of language to call it a statement of assurance. I am not sure it has not turned out to be a nonstatement of assurance or a statement of nonassurance. But it certainly is not a statement of assurance.  What we are finding is that the message is getting confused. We have seen a major argument between the Commission and the Court of Auditors about statistical methodology which is detracting from the whole value of the statement of assurance process. I must say to both institutions: sort that statistical row out and assure us, assure the Member States, assure the citizens that we have an agreed basis for a statement of assurance where we can all have confidence in the methodology. Unless we have it, in terms of the audit effort that is going into it, we are seriously wasting our resources. We have to be assured that the statement of assurance is a document well worth having.  I turn briefly to the Council for the last quarter of this precious five minutes. The Council and Parliament share a common language but I am not quite sure that we yet share a common philosophy. We share a common language when we all genuflect to words like efficiency ,  sound financial management and proper budgetary discipline . I can applaud the PresidentinOffice of the Council when he says all of those things. I would value the words even more if I was assured that the effort made by the Council at high ministerial level for the recommendations of discharge equalled as that made in the Budgetary Control Committee.  Mr Wynn has pointed out that  80   of the expenditure goes to the Member States. And yet it is the same Council that talks about efficiency and sound financial management that largely makes a mess of the agricultural regulations that make it possible for the fraud and irregularities to take place. So I ask them, when they talk about Sound and Efficient Management  2000 , to not only say this to the Commission but to make sure it is put into practice in the administration of the  15  Member States who are controlling the  80  .  The very final point is to pick up one thing that Mr Dankert said about his aspiration for giving discharge to the Council. I just reflect that if we had that power, this would be the year when we would be giving discharge to the Council for that Stalinist lookalike mausoleum known as the Council building, the one that they chose to build by designating it as compulsory expenditure. That would have been a very interesting contribution to our discharge debate had Mr Dankerts aspiration been available to us retrospectively.
8680624 author: Katarina Bauer:  Mr President, the Wynn, Blak and Bsch reports propose to give the Commission a discharge in respect of the implementation of the general Community budget for  1995 , as well as for the budget of the European Coal and Steel Community and of the European Development Fund. The Commission is committed to a careful followup to the items raised in the reports and in the resolution. In fact, considerable work is in progress to address Parliaments major preoccupations.  I would like to mention some of this work. First, on progress made in the context of the SEM  2000  initiative. The Member States are now gradually accepting the need for a joint approach to tackling the financial management issues which the Commission launched in SEM  2000 , in large part at the insistence of Parliament. A number of Member States have, for example, already accepted the invitation to respond directly to points made in the Courts reports. The contributions will be reflected in the followup report later this year, as requested in the Wynn report. That will give you an opportunity to have the information for which Mr Bardong asked.  On the consistent application of eligibility rules for the structural funds, an acceptable solution has now found unanimous approval in Council. The adoption of the definitive decision is on the agenda of the Commission next week. In the future, clear guidelines on recurrent eligibility problems will be included in all programming decisions. This will represent a major step towards the improvement in financial management. It represents an effective response to repeated criticisms by the Court and the European Parliament.  The second key question concerns possible financial corrections in the structural funds, to which Mr Dankert made reference. I want to reply to some of your comments. On this question progress still needs to be made. The Commission proposes to proceed with a twintrack approach. Firstly, we are tabling a draft Commission Regulation to clarify Member States responsibilities for financial control; this will be based on Article  23  of the present Council Regulation on the management of structural funds. Secondly, we shall clarify our internal guidance on the circumstances in which net financial corrections should be made under the terms of the existing legislation. This will be based on Article  24  of the above Council Regulation.  With regard to the method, I would like to be a little more precise because I know Parliaments great interest in this issue. I want to mention the following four points: firstly, the Commissions approach involves the clarification of the application of the existing structural fund regulations using existing legal powers; secondly, it is not seeking to impose new administrative structures on the Member States. The intention is rather to introduce adequate minimum standards of control which should be applied consistently throughout the Union; thirdly, the Commission is not proposing any fundamental change in the programming approach under which Member States are generally free to switch finance between eligible projects; fourthly and most importantly, it is appropriate to clarify those circumstances in which net financial corrections should be made without the possibility of substitution  for example where there has been a systematic failure in financial control or a refusal to cooperate with the Commission. Our intention is to apply this fourth position which means net transfers back.  I see that the resolution before you invites the Commission to make a proposal to amend Article  24  of Council Regulation  425388  to ensure that effective corrective action is taken in the event of irregularities. I can confirm that we have not ruled out this option for the future. We have already undertaken to review the relevant provisions of the Council Regulation before the start of the next programming period and we will take full account of Parliaments views in that context. I find it quite natural that when we make new proposals for structural fund programmes after  2000 , a new regulation is also a part of this global package. We are not talking about the very distant future. It is the year  2000  that they enter into force but proposals must be made before that.  However, I agree with Mr Dankert that we cannot afford to wait for this change in  2000  to take action in this area. Improvements can be made within the scope of the existing regulation, as I said, and it is for this reason that the Commission intends to proceed in the short term with the aforementioned twintrack approach.  In the context of SEM  2000 , efforts are being made to improve cooperation with the Member States on budget forecasting and execution. The tight budget constraints in the runup to the third stage of EMU reinforce the importance of obtaining the most uptodate and realistic estimates of budgetary requirements. We need to take this forward urgently, with a view to the preparation of the  1998  budget. Actually, this issue was discussed yesterday in the trialogue between the Council and Parliament. We had a problem with the forecasts in relation to agriculture. We must make our budget proposal in April. That is very far in advance of  1998 . If we have a chance to take a further look later this year and perhaps to send an amending and rectifying letter to Parliament that would give a more solid basis for next years budget decisions.  Parliaments rapporteur on SEM  2000 , Mr Colom i Naval, has been invited to attend the next meeting of the Personal Representatives Group in May and then we will try to conclude the issue of the financial corrections.  I shall touch briefly upon two other points. Firstly, the statement of assurance or DAS. As last year, Terry Wynns report describes very clearly the results and the difficulties. I share his unease about the numbers and their interpretation. I would like to emphasize that the problem is that there is a considerable lack of experience. The results from the first two DAS exercises have differed without good explanations on the ground. This underlines the experimental nature of DAS of which we were all aware from the beginning. It will take a few years before it is sufficiently mature to provide assurance not only for the auditor but also for the auditee. Until then all the numbers and especially conclusions resulting from a DAS exercise should be treated with prudence. Of course when we have discussions next summer with the Court of Auditors on the basis of the DAS for  1996 , we will take your wishes into account and we hope as far as possible to arrive at a common language while respecting, of course, the independence of the Court of Auditors in the exercise.  Secondly, on PHARE, the difficulties described by the Court and underlined by the Wynn report can only be acknowledged. As a first reply, the Commission decided on  19  March new policy guidelines for PHARE. They reorient PHARE to two main priorities  institution building and investment support. The management of PHARE is also to be reformed. There is to be a simplification of procedures, decentralization of implementation and an increased role for the EU delegations. Mr Tomlinson mentioned my remarks last year about concentrating on bigger projects which are easier to manage, to have a sufficient critical mass. PHARE reorientation is a good example of that.  We are trying to go further in some other areas in the budget. It is not easy in the Commission but you know as well as I do that it will not be easy in Parliament either. We must remember that we are now running a budget in a Union of  370  million people. Small budget lines with a very minor critical mass are actually impossible to execute in the way which would be efficient. The administrative costs are often higher than the budget sums concerned and there are no possibilities for control. So we should take a critical look at what can be implemented and how we implement it.  I heard the comment that we have not executed all the budgets. Sometimes there are sums in the budget lines which cannot be easily executed. We should not only discuss the political priorities but also how these can be translated into budgetary language which can be implemented.  Coming back to PHARE, further elements will become clearer when the Commission presents its preaccession strategy after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference. This work will be undertaken in close collaboration with Parliament. It should also facilitate the preparations for the  1998  budget.  Mr Blak asked me two or three very detailed questions. I hope I can come back to them after consulting my services. Perhaps next week we can have bilateral contacts on these issues.  Finally, I would conclude by thanking the rapporteurs, Terry Wynn, Freddy Blak and Herbert Bsch, the chairman of Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, as well as all the Members who made a great effort to analyse the report of the Court of Auditors and to identify the key measures to be taken. Your support is crucial for further progress towards sound Community financial management. There is a long way to go but we will remain firm and we will not turn back.
6446892 author: Marc McNabb:  Mr President, could I thank the Commission and the Council for the clarity of their statements and could I also begin by making clear what this debate is not about. It is not about China.  After  1  July Hong Kong will be governed under the principle of one country, two systems, and logically therefore Hong Kong has to be discussed in its own right and must not be used by people as a sort of Trojan horse to discuss and criticize China.  We have requested this debate for two particular reasons which we wish to highlight. Firstly, after  1  July Hong Kong will no longer be a solely British issue, it will become a concern for the whole of the European Union. And secondly, as has been said particularly by Commissioner Kinnock, a peaceful transition of Hong Kong is in the interests of all concerned. Hong Kong is the worlds eighth largest trading entity; it is the regional harbour for southeast Asia; it is the gateway to trade with China and as such is a major motor of economic growth in the world.  A successful transition will benefit us all. An unsuccessful transition will equally damage us all. A mishandled transition will, in particular, hamper important political developments in the region  including, it seems to me, Chinas eventual membership of the WTO, which we all hope will happen sooner rather than later. Of course there is no reason, as has been said by the Council and the Commission, why the transition should not go well. The Chinese Government has given a clear commitment to uphold the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, and I would certainly not wish to question the sincerity of that commitment. Furthermore, the decision to maintain in place the existing Chinese civil servants in Hong Kong is an important vote of confidence in the area, particularly given the high quality of the individuals concerned.  There are of course one or two areas of concern. The setting up of the provisional legislature was at worst illegal, as the governor claims, or at best unwise, unjustified and unnecessary, as the Americans have claimed. The intention to repeal or to amend the Bill of Rights Ordinance  which includes provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  along with the Societies Ordinance  which was aimed after all at dealing with the Triads  as well as the Public Order Ordinance which deals with meetings and demonstrations must cause us some concern about the future of human rights in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the way these measures are being proposed by a preparatory committee meeting in secret gives us no confidence for the future.  As the chairman of the Hong Kong bar association recently wrote, the rule of law requires that the process of making and repealing law is open, reasoned and in accordance with the law. I do not believe these proposals match that requirement and therefore it is important, as Commissioner Kinnock has indicated, that elections for a new Legislative Council are held as soon as possible. Article  70  of the Basic Law says that these elections should be held within three months of the dissolution of the existing Legislative Council. Given that it will be dissolved at midnight on  1  July  or one minute past midnight on  1  July  then these elections should be held this year and not next year as some in Hong Kong have claimed.  The rule of law of course is vital for the future, and yet a Chinese official commenting on the provisional legislature says it exists under a legal system different from that of the British Hong Kong Legislative Council. However, the continuing application of Hong Kongs legal system has been promised in every detail and therefore we must demand that the law is applied consistently, in accordance with the Basic Law.  When I was in Hong Kong a number of people observed to me that people involved in cases of litigation were asking for postponement of their cases to after  1  July, implying that they might be getting special favours after that date. We must not allow this to happen. There has to be respect for the rule of law. Similarly Mr Tung told me in conversation that he does not want to see foreign interference in Hong Kong political activity. I would agree with that. After all I have said that Hong Kong millionaires should not subsidize the British Conservative Party as they have been doing up to now! But there is a question about how far this law goes. Does it include all political activity, in which case trade unions will not be allowed to participate in the international fora, nor with human rights groups.  The best guarantee of human rights is the ability of people to cooperate at an international level. It is therefore vital that we get a message across today that human rights are not some addon extra, they are an essential prerequisite of a modern economy. You cannot have economic freedom without political freedom. That is why it is important that the Council of Ministers speaks with one voice on this issue  not as it has done on some other issues recently  and makes it clear that we are committed to ensuring the future prosperity of Hong Kong. That is why I welcome Commissioner Kinnocks statement that the Commission will monitor the transition in all its formats. That way we can ensure that all of us benefit from the continuing prosperity in Hong Kong.
6399147 author: Frederic MacLeod:  Madam President, Members will recall that we first debated my report on lobbyists in January  1996 . The Socialist Group and the Christian Democrats fundamentally failed to agree, and the result was that the report was sent back to committee. The public reaction to our failure to institute regulations was very negative and the result was that by July  1996  I produced a new, amended report taking into account some of the considerations and concerns that Members had about the initial report which was adopted by this House with only one Member voting against, if I recall correctly.  That was essentially a framework document to be filled out and it was agreed that there would be three further reports at least: a first report, on a code of conduct, which is what we have in front of us today; a second report, on the control of interest groups, which my colleague, Mr Spiers, is drawing up and is currently before the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities; and a third report, on Parliamentary assistants, that Mr Lehne is drawing up, which is also under discussion in the Rules Committee. This then is the first of these three reports, further elaborating the report that was adopted in July  1996 .  I am tempted in this context to give the same reply as the apocryphal doctoral student who, when asked to explain his thesis, said:  It is selfevident , but I shall not succumb entirely. The main parts were approved all but unanimously by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure. It states that lobbyists shall state their interest or the interest they represent when meeting with Members of Parliament, staff or officials, shall not claim any formal relationship with Parliament in any dealing with third parties, shall not circulate for profit to third parties copies of documents obtained from Parliament and shall comply strictly with the provisions of Annex I, Article  2 , second subparagraph which states that Members shall accept no gifts  ie. lobbyists may not henceforth offer any gifts to Members. The lobbyists also need to satisfy themselves that any assistance provided in the context of these provisions is declared in the appropriate register. There is an amendment here by Mr Donnelly which I shall be accepting, to tighten up that provision, but it does give them some responsibility to ensure that their actions are appropriately reported.  It also says that they need to comply, when recruiting former members of the institutions, with the provisions of the Staff Regulations. At the moment the Staff Regulations in this regard are an empty vessel. There are provisions in the Staff Regulations requiring certain categories of former employee to seek the permission of the institution to take jobs in other sensitive areas, but currently there are no members of staff so designated. This may, however, be something that will change in the future. The same applies to Amendment No  10  in which we ask lobbyists to observe any rules laid down by Parliament on the rights and responsibilities of former Members of the House where I understand the Quaestors are looking into this matter. It also says that if a lobbyist wants to employ a Members assistant, he has to seek the permission of the Member concerned. That seems selfevident.  Finally, it concludes that any breach of the Code of Conduct may lead to the withdrawal of the pass issued to the person concerned and, if appropriate, his firm. It is only if Parliament is willing to use this sanction that we shall actually be able to tighten up the provision.  There are two further amendments which are likely to encounter some opposition in the House tomorrow. One is Amendment No  12  which requires lobbyists to submit each year a report on their activities, with a view to securing the extension of their passes. There is some concern that this is going to lead to vast reams of paper being produced. I understand that there are groups in this House that will not be supporting it. If we were going to support it, I would probably recommend Mr Ephremidis amendment which asks that lobbyists state what particular assistance they have given to Members; however, the reference in that amendment to gifts is inappropriate, because we have already seen that gifts are illegal under our current provisions.  The final point is with respect to Amendment No  1  which says that only registered assistants working exclusively as assistants shall have access to Parliament under the same conditions as staff of the Secretariat or the political groups. At the moment our Rules state that Members assistants have privileged access. The Socialist Group would like to see the immediate closure of this loophole which actually leads to a situation where Members assistants can simultaneously work for lobby groups or even lobbyists themselves, but I understand that the PPE would prefer it to be included in the Lehne report which deals with the entire issue of Members assistants when that is voted on. We expect them, if that is the case, to deliver that commitment, otherwise we shall create not an obstacle to misuse but a fast track for it by allowing lobbyists to shortcircuit the system by employing our own assistants to do work that we are preventing them from doing.  I commend my report to the House and hope that it will be supported tomorrow.
5001701 author: Lynne Reid:  Madam President, we in the EPP Group think that the Collins report is fine as far as it goes, although we have our reservations about paragraph  11 , to which we have tabled an amendment and on which we hope Mr Collins will have second thoughts.  Clearly there is a very serious problem here: laws are passed on the environment and then they are widely ignored. Reporting requirements are introduced and they are ignored. Mr White apparently complains from his constituency in England, and his complaint is lost or forgotten and he does not hear anything about it. No one in Brussels can really say that they know how or whether the law is being enforced, even in crucial sectors of environmental policy such as hazardous waste management, where to date the European Commission has received reports from only six of the fifteen Member States. In fact you could say, in the presence of the Georgian delegation, that we are  sadly  not a terribly good example of how to apply European environmental legislation.  Fines are introduced, under Article  171  of the Treaty. They have been introduced rather laboriously but they have yet to be applied. I hope that when the Environmental Commissioner replies, she may be able to give us some uptotheminute news on what is happening to the actions which the Commission apparently announced in January under Article  171  against a number of Member States which have successively ignored European Court of Justice judgments since  1990 .  So I agree with the Collins recommendations on the whole. It is particularly interesting that Mr Collins has proposed that we should try to bring into play a sort of inspectorate of the inspectors  a small force that might be able to go around examining whether Member States are in fact putting the law into action themselves.  I offer three reinforcements to the points made in the report. We cannot continue to go on relying on individual complaints, such as those that have been mentioned, on inspection or on selfinspection  by which I mean the reporting requirement. My three points are as follows. First, on cost: one of the great deficiencies of the Commissions approach to environmental legislation is that it seems prepared to ignore the cost of legislation. The real trouble is: will a costimpact statement work? It does not have to apply to all legislation but we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection have seen that when a costimpact statement is put together it is either extremely difficult for the Commission to take action on it or it is completely worthless, as in the case of the impact statement on the bathing waters directive.  I therefore suggest to the Commission that it would be better, if we are going to apply codecision to the whole of environmental legislation  which is highly likely  that at some stage, either at the preliminary draft stage or at the common position stage, the Commission should invite the Member States to state their assessment of the cost of implementing the legislation within their territory. This should be a published statement by each Member State. It could then be debated. It would probably be hotly contested by nongovernmental organizations, but it would at least drag the issue out into the open, and I hope that idea recommends itself to the Commission.  Secondly, on transparency: the Commission should be more honest with Parliament about the problems it encounters with the Member States. I do not see any point in preserving confidentiality if all that does is make it more difficult to ensure that the law is being enforced. As an example: on  19  July  1996 , the Prime Minister of France had his office issue a press release stating that the implementation of the habitats directive in France was to be suspended. We MEPs owe it to my Dutch colleague, Mr Eisma, that he asked a written question in the Official Journal which brought this into the open. I am afraid that I did not know that this had happened. None of my French colleagues brought it to my attention and it would have been right for the Commission to come back to Parliament and say: look, help! The French have unilaterally suspended application to France of an entire directive which Parliament had a hand in adopting. That at least would have put the French Government on the spot. As it is, the implementation of that directive is still suspended in France, and that is completely unacceptable.  Thirdly and finally, enlargement: what do we do about enlargement? We are either going to have a very long series of derogations indeed in relation to existing environmental legislation, or we are going to have a situation where new Member States accept the existing bulk of legislation  the socalled acquis communautaire  and then do not do anything about it.  My final suggestion is that when the Commission presents new legislation to Parliament  which it really should have started to do on  1  January  1997   this should contain an enlargementimpact statement. Will it be possible even for the most hopeful Member States to comply with the sort of deadlines which we set, for example in the autooil directives or, more recently, in the directive of which I am the rapporteur, the landfill directive? They cannot even comply with that directive in East Germany. It is highly unlikely that any of the deadlines which the Commission is putting forward there would be met in Poland, Hungary, etc. We need an enlargementimpact statement attached to all environmental legislation put before this Parliament from now on.
2030346 author: Roger Bush:  Mr President, I want to begin by thanking both the PresidentinOffice of the Council and Commissioner Oreja for their contributions today. It was in accord with his positive and sunny nature that the PresidentinOffice of the Council gave us his usual optimistic version of what he thinks is going on in the IGC. Commissioner Oreja was just a bit more realistic, if not to say a bit more honest in his assessment of the way in which we think it is going.  In this Parliament I hope there are none  certainly in my group  who wish to be negative, difficult, or awkward. We want a positive outcome to the Amsterdam Summit. We are determined there will be if we can have any influence on that process because it is crucial for the development of the Union into the next millennium that we have a positive outcome. But, if we listen to the PresidentinOffices report, it is indicative of the fears and anxieties of the people of the European Union.  He made clear that the major politicallysensitive issues are those concerned with the institutional questions. I would rather he had said that the major politicallysensitive issues were about how we could really strengthen employment creation and the social dimension, move forward on creating a better environment, better consumer protection, better public health. My anxiety about what he said is that those issues are already the process of a large consensus which means that they are already decided and there is not much in them. That is why it is so easy to find political consensus on them.  It is important that we make politically clear that the citizens of the European Union are concerned about job creation. If we are serious about a chapter in the Treaty that deals with job creation, our citizens do not just want pious words. They want at least the Treaty to give us the right to start to coordinate our macroeconomic policies to generate job creation at European Union level. That is the only way that the employment chapter will have any meaning.  Similarly, on the social dimension, I am delighted that the social protocol will be integrated into the Treaty of European Union and delighted that  1  May, Labour Day, saw the election of a Labour Government in Britain that will allow that to happen. But we want to see some strengthening of that social protocol as well. We also want to see a move forward on gender equality and on an antidiscrimination clause with some real meaning. And we want to see these dealt with by qualified majority voting and codecision and not by unanimity which I suspect we may see, certainly on the antidiscrimination clause.  These are the things which affect people in the Union. These are the things which should be driving the last few days of the IGC, to make these things stronger, to make the message clear to our people. Commissioner Oreja made a very telling statement when he said that what we have is the minimum that public opinion could accept  the minimum! And that worries me and my group very much. We want to see the Union moving forward but its first priority must be to deal with those issues that have so destabilized public opinion in the European Union countries themselves about the value of the European Union to them and their families.  Let us see a real drive forward, not just pious rhetoric about these issues but a real step forward in the Treaty. My group will be assessing the Treaty on whether it meets the aspirations of the people of the Union.  It must also make the Union ready for enlargement and that means institutional changes. We could have hoped that our heads of government could have understood that in order to have an effective and efficient Union we must have institutional changes. They should be automatic if we are going to see the enlargement of the Union to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. So there really is an imperative to prepare the Union for enlargement by dealing firstly with the institutional situation that needs to be remedied. For instance, we need to reduce the Unions decisionmaking procedures to three and we want to see that happen. It has been the demand of this Parliament for a long time and we hope it will happen. And of course we want to see the extension of qualified majority voting and codecision. We want to see all those things that will ensure that this Parliaments rights are maintained.  We cannot and will not accept the diminution of any of the present rights of this Parliament  either its budgetary or legislative rights  in any field. I hope that will be taken back very clearly to the Intergovernmental Conference.
7259166 author: Annette Reid:  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing with yet another chapter in the long saga of leghold traps. I should like to concentrate on three aspects: the question of animal welfare, the institutional question of the decision within the European Community and relations with the World Trade Organization  WTO. Finally I shall refer to the question of the indigenous people and the line taken by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.  As regards the cruelty to animals dossier, there is no doubt that these leghold traps are cruel and do cause inhuman suffering. That is why Parliament has repeatedly called for their abolition and that is why the European Union has had, since  1991 , a regulation in force banning them.  As long ago as last century Charles Darwin stated that the use of this type of trap and this type of killing were incompatible with civilized societies. That was a hundred and thirty years ago! We now have to decide whether an agreement on humane trapping standards might be a good way of reducing cruelty to animals in the world. The answer would be yes provided we had a good agreement. Unfortunately, this text is a poor one and does not go far enough. That is certainly not the fault of the officials who negotiated it; they were rather, as we say in Portuguese bound hand and foot because of what their boss, Sir Leon Brittan, wanted and they had to reach an agreement at any price.  There is no shortage of examples in the text. In the point on fatal traps the European experts proposed on behalf of the Commission a time of  30  seconds to kill the animal. The agreement sets a time of  5  minutes. That is a long time  a very long time to die in agony  and it is a concession which increases the Commissions figure by a factor of  10 .  But the great problem with this agreement is that it is not selective enough in the classification of traps in relation to the standards laid down. I do not want now to go into the type of standards, which in some cases I regard as fairly low. To define a criterion for the approval of each type of trap  as this report does, as a function of the results, not for  80   of all animals trapped, but merely for  80   of the animals of the species targeted by the said trap  is an insult to the intelligence.  These traps are by definition nonselective. They catch all types of animals which suffer equally, even though not targeted, but simply because they have been unfortunate enough to roam where they were not supposed to roam or to drink water where they were not supposed to. But the most glaring example of the Commissions bad faith is in the subtle amendment it made to Article  4  ( 2 ) in Annex I, where in the version agreed in January for the present agreement there is a marked difference. I shall in fact read the January version in the original English which said: conventional steel jaw leghold retaining traps to be prohibited within four years of the entering into force of this agreement.  That, ladies and gentlemen, has disappeared from the version currently under discussion and has been replaced with unilateral statements by the countries wishing to accede to this agreement. That is a clear concession to the United States of America! What powers has the European Union to control the unilateral statements of the countries who wish to accede to this agreement? There is a lot more which could be said about the rest of the text, for example, Russia, in its unilateral statement, asks for money. The talk in the corridors is of ECU  30  million. We are going to buy the Russians for ECU  30  million. There is more that could be said, but instead I shall put a question. What about the United States? If the United States had not signed this agreement and took Europe to the WTO, what would we do? We should be in the same position as we are today.  I should like now to mention the institutional pact. The Commission, at the instigation of Sir Leon Brittan, blocked the adoption in  1995  of the regulations implementing Regulation No  91 . In January  1996 , by means of a letter from two officials, it advised the Member States not to apply the legislation in force. So can one simple letter prevent the application of legislation approved by the Commissions and by the Council? Where is the Rule of Law, Sir Leon Brittan?  In  1996  a new version was submitted which Parliament rejected on first reading. The Council never resubmitted it. In January  1997  an attempt was made at a Council meeting to pass a list of countries, including Canada and Russia, when there was no international agreement and these countries had not banned jaw leghold retaining traps, in clear violation of the European legislation. The Council quite rightly rejected this kind of approach.  It is now time to mention the WTO. I should like to say, however, that the Commissioner stated during the ratification process, that no further European legislation was at stake with accession to the WTO, other than the legislation mentioned at the time  and I supported that. Now it is the jaw leghold retaining traps which are at stake, the hormones in beef and who knows, Mr Commissioner, what it might be tomorrow?  I should like now to mention the indigenous people. From the outset I did try to obtain a regime for the indigenous people; they are assured that this Parliament will endeavour to find a solution which reconciles our legitimate right to demand less cruelty in the world with satisfying the legitimate need of those communities to make a living. Unfortunately, I did not find any parties to instigate social dialogue either in Europe or in Canada. But I remain available for such talks.  Thank you, Mr President, for bearing with me; I ask my colleagues to express their views by rejecting this bad agreement.
2661346 author: Lynne Smith:  Mr President, I want to begin by expressing my warm support for the efforts of the Dutch presidency over the past six months. Whatever our assessment of the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, we recognize the vigour and rigour which Prime Minister Kok personally has brought to the process. My group would certainly want to put on record our thanks to the Prime Minister, his Foreign Minister Mr Van Mierlo and his European Minister Mr Patijn and also the other members of his government who have given this Parliament such firm support.  It is our role here today to make an initial political response to the Treaty of Amsterdam. For my group this Treaty will be judged on two major issues. Firstly, does the Treaty respond to the aspirations, hopes and expectations of the peoples of the European Union? Secondly, does the Treaty make the Union ready for enlargement to Cyprus, the Baltic States and Central and Eastern Europe? I want to make it clear that my group recognizes and welcomes the advances which the Amsterdam Treaty has brought in dealing with a peoples Europe.  Firstly, we very much welcome the decision of the Council to put employment at the top of its agenda. My group supports the inclusion of the new title on employment and the social protocol into the Treaty as well as the reference to fundamental social rights. We recognize that words in a Treaty never created a single job. But we also recognize that the new competence allows us for the first time to create a framework in which the serious coordination of the economic and employment policies of the Member States can begin. This is surely what we can do at European level to ensure that the work being done by Member States to deal with the curse of unemployment is sustainable, ensuring that economic and employment policies across fifteen of the richest countries in the world working in close and careful harmony will make a huge contribution to growth and real job creation.  Knowing as I do the PresidentinOffices commitment to the fight against unemployment, I should like to turn to him with a message from the Socialist Group. If the Council was really serious about job creation, there is a real opportunity to prove it immediately. The Unions broad economic guidelines are yet to be fully adopted by the Council. There is a stated commitment in the resolution on growth and employment to ensure that employment is taken into greater account when establishing the broad economic guidelines. You will also know that the Finance Ministers meeting in ECOFIN have a reputation for completely ignoring the entreaties of the European Council. We need the Prime Ministers of the Member States to exercise their authority and insist that the broad economic guidelines are now revised. Nothing would give a stronger signal of good intention than that. Nothing would silence the cynics more quickly than that. And, President Santer, nothing would prove the political commitment of the European Commission more than if they insisted on such a revision.  Such a move would also give a clear signal that the summit on employment to be held in October under the Luxembourg presidency had real political muscle behind it and was intended to come forward with concrete proposals, rather than the usual ritual blah blah. The promises on employment now need some flesh on their bones. The adoption of the broad economic guidelines offers the first opportunity and the employment summit offers the second.  On behalf of my group I also want to recognize the other positive aspects of the Amsterdam Treaty. The acknowledgement of respect for human rights; the new nodiscrimination clause, although it is such a pity that in the European Year against Racism and Xenophobia the Council could not adopt this competence with qualified majority voting; the clear step forward on equal opportunities, the environment, public health and consumer protection; the developments on transparency and openness and the reduction in the number of decisionmaking procedures and the streamlining and extension of codecision for the European Parliament.  I understand that some governments are even now questioning the extended list of codecision, arguing that decisions made by unanimity in the Council cannot be subject to codecision with the European Parliament. Perhaps the Prime Minister could draw the attention of Member States to the existent powers on culture, Article  128  of the present Maastricht Treaty and the existing powers on research, Article  130  of the Maastricht Treaty, both of which grant codecision with the European Parliament while acting unanimously in the Council. The Prime Minister will have the total support of this Parliament in insisting that the list of articles to be dealt with by codecision, as published in the draft Treaty of Amsterdam and now widely circulated, is sustained.  My group are also deeply disappointed with progress on the second and third pillars of the Treaty. We have made it clear all along and have supported your efforts to communitarize some aspects of the justice and home affairs pillar. We respect the fact that some transfer has been made but I want to repeat the real anxiety we have about the lack of parliamentary control which now exists in these areas  crucial areas of immigration policy, visa controls and asylum. By retaining unanimity in the Council and only consulting the European Parliament, real democracy in these areas is thwarted.  On the issue of common foreign and security policy, we always knew it was going to be difficult to make real progress, in particular on defence issues and my group is pleased that we are able to integrate the Petersberg tasks into the Treaty. But we remain concerned about the lack of a coherent foreign policy voice for Europe. We hear what the Treaty says about a Mr or Ms CFSP but with unanimity in the Council, how will Mr or Ms CFSP know with what voice to speak.  Perhaps our greatest disappointment is with regard to enlargement. We have grave misgivings about the inability of the Council to agree on any meaningful extension of QMV. More than any other issue, this puts enlargement at risk. With even more Member States at the table in the coming years, how can we expect to see high standards being set in European legislation to protect the living and working condition of Europes peoples. Therefore my group believes that it is vital that before enlargement the European Council must come together again to address the question of majority voting in the Council as well as the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes.  I conclude by saying that my group is firmly of the view that a Treaty which, despite our misgivings, has made steady progress on the agenda important to our peoples cannot be dismissed.
6056386 author: Claire Corless:  Mr President, genetic resources, patents and their economic control are the key questions of the coming millennium. With unlimited patentability, life itself and all living plants and animals would become an industrial product. Even human life would be exploited by this directive. The genetic resources of our planet must not be monopolized in the private hands of a few companies.  At the moment the European Patent Convention draws a clear line between inventions and living material. First of all, discoveries such as genes are not patentable; plant and animal varieties and procedures for the breeding of plants and animals are excluded from patents. To photocopy the genes and then declare that an invention is a travesty of science. The pressure that industry has exerted on politicians in order to ensure that the patent system includes living material is intense. The way this directive is being pushed through is contrary to acceptable political decisionmaking. This requires open discussion and informed decision by those given a mandate by their citizens.  If the Commission has sought to prohibit Commission employees from freely disseminating information to the public, this would be an attack going to the heart of our European democracy, and I want an answer from the Commissioner on this point.  Commissioner Cresson gave this House an assurance on the banning of human cloning, but the directive does not ban patents on the product of human cloning. That a protohuman being could be cannibalized for spare parts cannot be contemplated.  Patients suffering from inherited diseases have been told that patenting is necessary for the development of therapies. The reverse is true: the patenting of human genes will create problems for the development of therapies. Free and immediate access to information, i.e. in the human genome project, is the prerequisite for the beneficial use of this information. Patents on the gene would mean that a single biomedical company could completely control all future research and medical development leading from the isolation of a specific gene. This would not foster research but kill it. It would also make the possibility of genetic testing for a disorder such as breast cancer so prohibitively expensive that it would be beyond the scope of the public health services. While new techniques will soon allow rapid and inexpensive analysis of genes, if a patent has to be paid on each gene analysed, testing for breast cancer predisposition could become prohibitively expensive.  One of the key issues is the question of whether doctors and medical personnel will be free to diagnose and treat people without a royalty payment to the patentholder. Current law prohibits patents on methods for the treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human body. This is removed by the draft directive. I urge colleagues to vote for Amendment No  91  by the Green Group which proposes such a doctors exemption. An example of the problems raised is the case of the breast cancer gene already referred to. The US patentholders, Myriad, have applied for a Europatent and are seeking to charge over  2 ,  000  dollars for its use in screening.  If the directive is passed, there are serious implications for our access to food and medicine. Our gene cells and body parts and our resistance to hereditary disorders would become the monopoly property of the companies that hold the patents on them. This would legitimize trade in such items as blood plasma and transplant organs which are now prohibited from sale in many Member States and are the subject of a complex donor network organized by the national health departments for the public good. For example, the granting of a patent on umbilicalcord blood could deny access to these blood cells to anyone unable to pay for them.  Colleagues, the Clinton administration in the US has sought to move US health care towards a European model. If we now move our European health service towards an American model, leaving aside the public good, the citizens of these Member States will not forgive us.
10203393 author: James Reid:  Mr President, as vicechairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, I am presenting this report on behalf of the chairman Mr Fayot who cannot be here and sends his apologies. As Mrs Palacio, the original rapporteur, has mentioned, Mr Fayot took over the role in the accepted manner when she indicated after the vote that she felt unable to continue. She took an opposing view and once the committee had adopted the report she asked Mr Fayot to present it. However, I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Palacio for the work she has put into this report and for the extremely honest way she made her contribution to the report and has presented her views again this afternoon.  The vote in our committee was not along political lines. People in the political parties voted in different ways. As has been said, this case goes back over three years to the time of the last elections to the European Parliament in the summer of  1994 . For a variety of reasons, it has taken this length of time to come before Parliament. One of these reasons  perhaps the primary one  was because there was some rather ambiguous communications with the Portuguese authorities at first and Parliament was not sure exactly what was being requested of it.  During the  1994  European election campaign, the Portuguese Socialist Party held a press conference at its headquarters at which Mr Campos made some remarks about Mr Arlindo Cunha, the former Agricultural Minister. The report before you notes that there were three particular allegations. They are listed on page five of this report and I do not need to read them out now. The accusations are that, under Portuguese law, by making such remarks, Mr Campos contravened various articles of the Portuguese penal code.  We all know that the press can present matters and statements in a way that does not necessarily show a Member of the European Parliament in a favourable light and in this case certainly one remark was taken out of context and misconstrued by the press. However, it seems that Mr Campos remarks were not made on the spur of the moment. Notwithstanding that, under article  10  of the Protocol to the Treaty of the European Communities, a Member of the European Parliament is immune from prosecution during its sessions. This has been taken and accepted to mean any time during the period of office and at any place within his or her own country and within any other Member State.  To face prosecution for any charge, a Member must have his or her immunity lifted as the previous speaker said. Since the offence of which Mr Campos is accused happened in Portugal he is protected by the same laws that would protect a member of the Portuguese Parliament under article  160  of their constitution. In this Parliament, Rule  6  of the Rules of Procedure covers the matter. The allegations against Mr Campos stem from the election campaign and the election campaign was before he was elected.  The purpose of Rule  6  is to protect both Members and Parliament itself by guaranteeing the independence of the institution. At that time Mr Campos was a Member of the Portuguese Parliament but only a member of the opposition. In any constitution or any democracy, the oppositions role is sometimes to support the government but also to oppose when it sees fit. There can be no more important time to oppose than during an election campaign. That is what Mr Campos did when both he and Mr Cunha were both candidates. He opposed the policies of a government minister during an election campaign, making various public statements. I would suggest that during a campaign the minister, Mr Cunha, could have defended himself in the same political way. It happens all the time in politics. It happens especially at election time  it is what elections are for.  This was the interpretation and the view that prevailed by a majority in the committee. It was for the reasons I have stated and which are listed in the report that the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities decided in this instance alone against waiving the parliamentary immunity of the aforementioned Mr Campos.
8538186 author: Victor MacLeod:  Mr President, I should like to reiterate what Mr Bourlanges and Commissioner Liikanen have said about the way that we have had good cooperation with the Council on this occasion compared to last year for instance. It shows what can be done when we work together. There is a but coming up shortly. I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs because the work they have done has helped us tremendously. In Mr Tomlinsons case, the other institutions report has gone pretty smoothly; and in Stanislaw Tillichs case, he has gone out of his way to work with the various groups to try to get good results when we voted in committee.  I also wish to thank Jan Mulder, the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the problems we have had in the past over the agricultural budget have been smoothed tremendously because of him. I do not need to say too much on category  1 , because Jan has already said it.  I should like to make clear that the Socialists have tried to be consistent in their approach to this budget. We know that a stringent, prudent budget was needed and we also know that employment had to be at the top of the agenda. We have tried to look at the positions of Parliament and at what had and what had not got a legal base; we have looked at the wishes of the committee and at how the lines were being spent. Taking those things into consideration, we have actually come up with a consistent policy. At times we have done things with which I did not agree. In agriculture, I actually led the vote against the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the tobacco sector, where we agreed to keep the money on tobacco where it is rather than take it out, because that is the way Parliament had voted in July. That is just one example of where we have tried to go along with Parliaments wishes.  On the structural funds, the ECU  100  million that we have all now agreed for the Irish peace process is an excellent example of how the three institutions have worked together to ensure that this has been achieved without a legal base. I should like to make one point clear to the Commission on this  I am not too sure that it is directed at DG XIX so much as DG XVI: we are not kidding, this is serious, we want to see the monies we have made available for Rechar and Retex implemented. It is Parliaments wish from last year and we want to ensure that this money on Rechar and Retex is indeed spent.  On category  3 , as I said, our priority has been on the employment chapter. I wish to say to the PresidentinOffice at this point: our group has put a lot of effort into getting a commitment and an agreement on this strategy. At times it has not been easy. We have seen some budget lines sacrificed so that we could go for this strategy; we have seen some lines take decreases and some lines disappear, where some of our colleagues were asking us to maintain them or indeed increase them. It has not been easy to convince our colleagues of the validity of this exercise. However, we have stuck with it, we have gone with it, and we hope that on Thursday Parliament can vote through a programme which will help create jobs in Europe.  I have to say to the PresidentinOffice  and this is where the but comes in  that our great cooperation depends on this. If the Council cannot deliver, if we do not get a legal base and if his colleagues treat this in a flippant manner, then all hell will be let loose. That ECU  350  million will be redistributed throughout category  3 . We will find lines where it will go; we will ensure that it is put on those lines where it can be spent; and that will make a joke of our strategy. A lot depends on whether the PresidentinOffice can persuade his colleagues in the Council, and I am sure that he will do that. If it does come off, if we are successful, then once again we can show that if we have good interinstitutional cooperation, we can find the solutions that we all look for in a variety of areas.  On category  4 , the Group has been consistent in its approach to Turkey and Meda. We do not agree with the vote in committee about putting an amount in reserve. I make the point now that we will be voting against the amendment to put the Meda money on the line.  It is worth mentioning two lines specifically in category  4 : one is the sex tourism line, introduced by Mr Colom, which we need to do something about; the second is the CFSP for the landmines. That should be given full support from all groups.
1729625 author: Frederic Cameron:  Mr President, what is the state of the Union? It rather depends on whose eyes you are looking through. One thing is for sure: the Union is different if you see it through the eyes of different actors in our society.  If you are an industrialist or financier in the financial sector in one of our major cities, then the growing confidence in the coming of the single currency is probably like manna from heaven to you. Your longterm future is taking a more stable, secure turn; planning your resource allocation, your investment decisions and prospects for growth is easier and less speculative; transaction costs look to largely disappear whilst current monetary orthodoxy seems fairly sure to keep inflation to minimal levels and to ensure the downward pressure on individual and corporate taxes. Not too bad...  If, however, you are one of Europes  1820  million unemployed, the state of the Union looks pretty dire. The global market, the revolution of the information society, mean about as much to you as the steam train must have meant to the horse and cart. One thing they know is that on the back of the global market and the information society, jobs have been lost. The socially excluded, the unemployed, the underemployed can be excused for eyeing the forthcoming employment summit with some scepticism or, indeed, indifference. They have been there before; seen that, done that, got the Tshirt.  If we are going to tackle that scepticism and indifference, the employment summit must succeed. We want concrete proposals, real downtoearth action which will create jobs.  I understand that some in the media have already written their headlines for the employment summit:  No pot of gold, job summit fails . Let us start talking with a bit more common sense. We all know that there is not a pot of gold waiting to be had. Most of us know that just throwing money at the problem is not, in itself, sufficient or even sensible. Where money can make a difference and where we can find it, then it must be provided. This Parliament will, I hope, put its money where its mouth is when we vote tomorrow for the employment package for small and mediumsized enterprises. To find that money we will have to reduce spending in other areas  hard for us as a Parliament to agree to. But certainly my group is determined, because employment is our number one priority.  This is only small beer, though. It can help by adding value to what is being done at national level to create jobs. Without question, the best way that we can aid job creation is to really begin the process of coordinating our economic and employment policies. If the job summit can begin that process and provide a package of support measures as well, then we may be in the business of giving real prospects and opportunities to those who need our help.  So what is the state of the Union if you are a business operating in the single market? Life is still, unfortunately, beset with a fair degree of red tape, obstruction and lack of information. Judging by the complaints I get from business in my constituency in North London alone, there are ongoing problems of VAT; protectionism still abounds when it comes to product licences and patents; there is a marked lack of enforcement.  Seen through the eyes of us as consumers, be it from the North of Finland, the South of Greece, the West of Ireland or the East of Austria, the single market has provided a greater variety of better quality goods. In the last two or three years, we have seen the danger of adopting a less than rigorous approach to consumer protection and public health at European level. The BSE crisis focused attention on the paucity of the lowest common denominator approach to consumer protection. In this context, this Parliament has done the European consumer a great service by insisting that the European Commission reorganize its services, policies and resources to give a high priority to consumers and public health. We will very shortly be putting the Commission response to our recommendations under the spotlight in this Chamber. We recognize as well that the Council in Amsterdam acknowledged the need for a revamped consumer and health policy in the new treaty and we hope that it will meet its obligations in full by supporting Parliament and the Commission to restore consumer confidence in the fact that their food and other products are not just safe but wholesome and of a high standard.  If you are an animal ferreting away in your European habitat, the state of the Union does not look at all rosy just now. However, you might see the European Commission as your friendly gamekeeper, given it had just announced infringement proceedings against a great majority of the  15  EU Member States for failing to transpose the habitats directive into national law.  Those involved in the struggle for the environment know that the recession which engulfed Europe postRio saw the shameless jettisoning of many of the commitments made there in terms of habitats, climate change, marine pollution and much more. There is now a further opportunity, following the New York meeting, to join with the rest of the UN Member States at Kyoto in December to expedite change. This is not a Europeonly struggle. But our position, which I hope is a progressive one, can be influential, not just in keeping pressure on countries in the developing world to pay attention to the environment in their economic programmes but, crucially, to force the United States to understand its responsibility and its role as the worlds leading nation to take action with us.  If you happen to be one of the growing band of drug smugglers or international criminals or the like, there is still, sad to say, gold to be had in Europe. For them the EU and its Member States still offer opportunities to be exploited. Each Member State is experiencing its own increase in international crime of one kind or another, the rapid and tragic growth in the drugs trade, terrorism and the trade in arms or the growing malevolent trade in humans. If you examine the extent and the scale of these areas of activity, as this Parliament did in just one committee on enquiry into fraud involving goods in transit, it becomes clear that the only way to combat this sort of multicountry crossborder trade is through international cooperation.  This is why the role of the European Union is so important for the future development of information sharing, enforcement authorities, policing strategies and cooperation across borders. It is only by working together, with agreed strategies, that we can have a real impact in those areas of the world which need help and support to reduce their domestic dependence on the drugs trade in particular. Europes citizens, who quite understandably worry about the drugs culture in which their young are growing up, and which is responsible for so much of the violence in our society, have much to gain through greater European cooperation in this area.  If you are a small banana grower in the Caribbean, you could be excused for thinking that the Europeans are the lowest of the low. They came to your idyllic island many years ago in the quest for resources. Those same Europeans encouraged the change of production to the multicropping banana. You and your family depend for your living on the banana industry and now the WTO, at US insistence, has ruled to cut out the privileged trade access to Europe for your bananas in favour of the dollar banana. Where is your livelihood now? The European Union must renegotiate the existing Lom Convention in the coming years and we must seek a new partnership with our African Caribbean and Pacific neighbours.  The state of the Union also looks quite different to the citizens of eastern and central Europe. Those from Hungary, Poland, The Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia who see their way being expedited into the marble palaces of the European Union must have a view quite different from those who, if not exactly excluded, certainly feel at arms length from the process.  For Europes current  370  million citizens, enlargement of the EU to a further  11  countries in the foreseeable future is a huge leap into the unknown with fears of dwindling support for them through the EU budget, agricultural and structural funds and cohesion support. There is a big job of work to be done by all of us engaged in the politics of Europe to make clear our determination: firstly, not to isolate or marginalize or leave out any of our partner states in eastern and central Europe but, secondly, to point out to our own citizens the costs of nonenlargement  the economic damage, lack of stability, potential for conflict, regional disintegration, environmental degradation and so much more.  If you are a black person in Europe, it has always been tough. Recent years, however, have been grim. An increase in the politics of hate, jealously and scapegoating have led to more racist abuse, harassment, attacks and, most tragically, murders. Thankfully, Europes new treaty now contains the broadest possible antidiscrimination clause. Unthinkable just nine months ago. The European Year Against Racism and AntiSemitism, an observatory in Vienna to combat racism and the treaty competence  a fitting way to remember  1997 .  The state of the Union is not simple, its sometimes bad, sometimes good. It could hardly be otherwise. It is, however, incumbent on us to take the work seriously. We must get on and help the Union to find concrete ways forward on employment and we must endorse the Amsterdam Treaty, warts and all. We must enable the countries of Cyprus, Central and Eastern Europe to join us in our common endeavours.
2579442 author: Katarina Finlayson:  Mr President, we are all agreed that Mr Schulz has produced an excellent and comprehensive report on the measures which need to be taken to combat child sex tourism and to reinforce the prevention of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. The assessment of the main problems and the measures proposed have been somewhat overshadowed by the substantial interest in paragraph  29  of the resolution. This paragraph calls on a judge at the European Court of Justice to resign his European post due to his earlier personal decision when he was Minister for Justice to permit the early release of Marc Diedres who is suspected of multiple child murders.  I understand and respect the arguments of those who say that the European Parliament has no competence or right to make such a demand. Indeed, we are all being drawn into an internal political debate but as the rapporteur says, the consequences of the decision were indeed dreadful. There is a moral and political responsibility which cannot be swept under the carpet. It is very clear that the European Parliament does not have the power to dismiss a judge at the Court of Justice. However, we have a moral obligation to draw attention to this situation and we have to stand up and be counted on an issue as important as this.  Many other important arguments and proposals are put forward in this resolution and my group is particularly pleased that at the outset of the report Mr Schulz stresses the decisive role of the family in ensuring the balanced development of children. The family should represent the safe haven for the child. In certain cases it is also where child abuse takes place and we know that children have been abused in schools and institutions. The veil of secrecy on abuse is now lifting and no country can take pride in what all too often children have been subjected to. The ultimate crime is to do nothing, to neglect our duty to protect children everywhere including those who are forced into child prostitution.  We need a range of services to protect our children and an earlywarning system to alert us to potential dangers. We are fifteen Member States with different traditions but working together we can help to close the door on child abuse and ensure there is no hiding place in the EU for child offenders. It is the least we can do for the parents and families of all the children who have been abducted, including Julie, Melissa and Lubna. We must break down legal barriers to harmonize those concepts of criminal legislation in the Member States which reduce our capacity to protect our children. We should try to harmonize the criminal offence of paedophile activities, the criminal offence of child sex tourism and child pornography and there should be comparable penalties for such crimes throughout the Member States.  It is appropriate that data banks be set up at national level concerning persons found guilty of paedophile activities and everything possible must be done to make it easier for children to provide evidence to the court without fear. We must also support the setting up of the European Centre for missing children. The Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington is an example. Every country should support the telephone helpline for children.  I am highly critical of the way in which children can be abused for advertising purposes and I strongly hold the view that the rights of children must be respected. The case of the young British au pair who was found guilty in the United States of fatally injuring a child in her care has raised other concerns. There is a Council of Europe Convention on au pairs but very few countries have signed. Therefore, I call on the Council now to ask the Commission to draw up a European Union regulation on the role and duties of au pairs but, more importantly, on the duties and responsibility of the families who invite them into their homes.  In conclusion, I want to emphasize what is said in paragraph  30  of the resolution: all those who have to take decisions which may affect the safety or wellbeing of children must exercise the greatest possible care and take the maximum precautions to safeguard and protect the interests of children. The blanket of secrecy has been lifted. We may not like what is underneath but we cannot fail our children.
10422455 author: Christoph MacLeod:  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report and largely we can agree with most of the contents.  Before I refer directly to the issues that are raised in the report, I think it is worth noting at this point that back in  1989  I wrote the Parliaments first report on stage one of EMU. At that stage barely any Europeans were interested in the process of economic and monetary union. Today, we are actually talking about the design and the content of the coins because they are going to be issued in the very near future. It is a sign of the enormous progress that the European Union has made that we are now actually dealing with the practicalities of the single currency and not simply talking about the theory of economic and monetary union.  As far as the report is concerned directly, can I say that I agree with the rapporteurs point regarding the nickel content of the coins. I hope that the Commission will urge the Ecofin Council to look at this question again. There is an enormous lobby within the European Union now because of the health effects of nickel and the possibility that this will be introduced into coins used widely around the European Union. It would be rather inconsistent, since we only recently passed a report in this Parliament calling for nickel to be removed from jewellery and from other things that come into contact with people, to find that we are accepting large amounts of nickel in our new currency. The consumer lobby on this issue really needs to be listened to. It is not only the Scandinavian countries where there is a concern. Throughout the European Union there are consumer organizations that are representing public opinion here. If someone becomes sensitized to nickel, then, of course, if they ever come into contact with it subsequently, they can be subject to a very severe reaction. I would ask Commissioner Kinnock to take this matter back and to ask the Commission to look at this question again. We have seen the scientific evidence and clearly there is room there for worry. We need to readdress this question.  With regard to the number of coins and the dimensions of the coins: again I would support the rapporteur. We want to try and rationalize the number of coins that we are using and indeed in many of our Member States we are reducing the number of coins in terms of their denominations. It seems rather strange, that as we move to the single currency with the possibility of smart cards and electronic money and so forth, that we are proposing the rather backward step of having eight separate coins in circulation. So I would, again, ask the Commission to look at this question.  In relation to the dimensions; we have had an enormous lobby in this European Parliament from the organizations representing the blind, who want to be able to clearly differentiate between one denomination of a coin and another. I really do not believe that the Finance Ministers have taken this question on board and I would ask the Commission and the Council to look at this matter again.  Finally, I want to come to the question of national symbols on the single currency. We are launching this single currency on  1  January  1999 , the coins and notes will be in circulation in  2002 . This is not simply a calculation, it is not simply a step that is being done by bankers, this is a step that is being taken by the citizens of the European Union. It is absolutely crucial that in the initial stages of this enormous historic step, they feel comfortable and familiar with the currency that they are using. I have to say that I think it is crazy for this House to consider removing the possibility of national symbols on the new currency when it is issued. For that reason, we in the Socialist Group will be opposing the paragraphs within the report which call for a harmonized coin for the whole of the European Union and we will support Mrs Peijs amendment which calls for national symbols to be possible on these coins.  We, in this House, having debated economic and monetary union for many years now, should not underestimate the level of public feeling, not only in countries like the United Kingdom but in other countries around the European Union. We want this very much to be a peoples initiative and we want them to be comfortable with the currency, with the coins and notes that they have in their pocket. The possibility, if they so wish, to have national representation on those coins and notes is an extremely important step to achieve public acceptability in the early stages.  We largely support this report; it is an important step and we hope the Commission and the Council will listen to some of the criticisms that we have made. We should not try to harmonize things for the sake of harmonization. We have to recognize with the single currency that we still want some national diversity.
713631 author: Roger Reid:  Mr President, I too welcome what my colleagues have been able to do in the committee and I salute the real heroes of this report  Mr Medina, Mr Bge and Mrs RothBehrendt  for the major work they have done, and also those in the Commission who have interacted with us in an extremely positive way over the past six months.  BSE and CJD have been a nightmare for Europe for some years. Many have lost their livelihoods and some have lost their lives. The Medina report and its followup have shown that the European Parliament can take an appropriate initiative by itself in this matter. It is another form of codecision, except that here we were not responding to proposals that came to us from the Commission or the Council but taking a view because of the absence of such proposals at an earlier stage. The criticisms of the Commission during the debate on the Medina report were made in that spirit.  We should acknowledge quite properly that the Commission has made considerable advances, in particular through DG XIV, in the last six months. Because of that, by far the majority view in my group and in others as well, is that a vote of censure would be inappropriate. There are many things which still trouble us. One is the somewhat dilatory attitude to disciplinary procedures within the Commission itself but that is no ground for a vote of censure. We said at the outset that while we were concerned with issues of public health and safety, we are not a committee of public safety in the French revolutionary sense, calling for heads, calling for show trials. We simply want to make certain that the lessons with regard to internal discipline are learned as effectively as some others.  We also feel that the Council was lethargic early on in its response to the Commissions very necessary proposals for health and safety and the treatment of risk materials throughout the Community. The whole of our committee, in particular on its visit to the United Kingdom, was moved by the plight of the CJD victims and their families which was eloquently expressed to us by Mr and Mrs Churchill. The whole committee wanted to express solidarity with the victims of this terrible disease and their families. We know that this must be material sympathy and support, as well as mere moral support. It must involve the Member States as well as the Commission, and we look forward to initiatives on both sides in that regard.  Speaking for myself, an inquiry into the origins of CJD in the UK is long overdue and I shall do all I can to try to bring it about. The argument in principle is settled and there should now be no unnecessary delay over the details. The UK Government welcomes this report. This time there is none of the spiteful criticism that was directed at Mr Medinas earlier report. When he came before the committee the minister, Dr Cunningham, made it perfectly clear that the committee would be right to call him and that he would always attend. It is better to lay some stress on the positive aspects of that, rather than go into the legal quibbles of what is or is not requested or permitted or demanded under the Interinstitutional Agreement.  The United Kingdom has been at the centre of the BSE epidemic from the beginning but, with the precautionary measures which have now been put into effect, it is entitled to be seen as setting an example in health and safety standards, including the safe storage of rendered carcases. A number of people have referred to this. I would simply point out that whilst everything has been done to meet the conditions of the Florence agreement, it is absolutely the essence of health and safety that rendered carcases  in the form of meat and bonemeal in which they are stored  should be kept in conditions of absolute security and safety until they can be safely incinerated. We should not be demanding that the whole stockpile be put up the chimney at once.  We believe that all Member States should now be prepared to join in precisely the same preventive measures which have already been implemented in the United Kingdom. Recent events in Belgium have shown that BSE can occur in states which felt they were free of it and that mistakes can be made in analysis and in the final destiny of the carcasses concerned. I do not say that in any spirit other than one of sympathy and  to use the word that the President himself used today  solidarity with any country anywhere which finds itself affected by BSE in the way that we in the United Kingdom have been.  The answer is not to clamour for BSEfree regions or zones but to recognize that throughout the European Union we are a single zone which needs total security, safety, traceability and vigilance as the soundest basis for consumer confidence and for beef to be traded once again throughout the Community on its merits and in a market where that confidence has been restored.  My final point is just to say that in the future this process of scrutiny must continue and I look forward to the information campaign on food safety which DG XXIV is planning for  1998 . I hope that campaign will be launched during the British Presidency with full backing from Member States and consumer groups. From all of this, after so much distress, much good can come for both consumers and producers in the Community. Mutual trust between them and a proper regime of health and safety has to be the outcome of the BSE crisis.
10204157 author: Helen White:  Mr President, I hope nobody listening to this debate is in any doubt about the seriousness of the course we are about to embark upon. We are about to engage in a historic process which in my opinion will either make or break the European Union. If we handle this process properly the European Union will become a genuinely wide European Union, not simply a Western European Union. It will become a zone of stability and prosperity which will improve the quality of life of all its citizens and it will become a major force for good in the world beyond its borders. However, if we get this process wrong, the European Union will at best become a bloated introverted structure incapable of making effective decisions and it could become one which will be in danger of losing any concept of a common vocation. At the very worst we could see the European Union begin to crumble to the deafening sounds of mutual recriminations and contradictory ambitions, as well as endless disputes about obscure matters of European law.  Quite simply the challenge which is facing us today is to make quite sure that we get it right and that enlargement benefits the European Union and does not undermine it. We have to make sure that at the end of the process we have a European Union which is effective and efficient, built on democratic legitimacy, which respects the relationship between small and large states and which respects the principle of subsidiarity. That is a tall order. It will not be easy. It is the challenge we must confront at the beginning of the new century. If the challenge of the  1980 s was to complete the single market, the challenge of the  1990 s to complete the single currency, the challenge at the turn of the century must be to create and make enlargement work for the benefit of the European Union. It will require imagination, sensitivity, goodwill and, above all, honesty of political approach.  Our political message here today must be simply this: yes, we believe in enlargement, we want it to go ahead and we are not going to renege on our historic commitment to the countries of central and eastern Europe. Secondly, we believe this process should be an inclusive one, that all countries in central and eastern Europe and Cyprus are in the pipeline to European Union membership, although they may be at different stages of that pipeline. But we must also recognize that process will be immensely difficult. We talk glibly about taking on the acquis communautaire , for example. We often do not point out that the acquis communautaire now covers  80 ,  000  pages of text and  20 ,  000  legal acts. That is quite a lot to take on.  We must also remember that these countries are all poorer than we are and they have to go through major problems of economic restructuring. So our next message must be that it is vital for the European Union to step up its preaccession strategy, to increase the speed of preparing these countries for membership. In particular, I would urge greater attention to be paid to the administrative and judicial capacity of these applicant countries. In my view that is the biggest obstacle to accession to the European Union.  We also have to say that some countries are more ready to go through this last stage down the road to European Union membership than others. Therefore, we have to accept the Commissions recommendations that we should proceed with five countries in addition to Cyprus. A further message is that no country is in the European Union yet. Starting this process does not guarantee you will finish it. A lot of work needs to be done and, equally, if a country is not part of those initial negotiations, they can still join if they make great strides. It is a flexible process.  We must also make it clear that the European Union has to change. When we talk about change we must remember that enlargement has to be ratified by every single parliament in the European Union and by this parliament. Therefore, all the changes we propose must have the consent of the people. We cannot go beyond what they wish to see.  Finally, our message must be that the European Conference gives us a major opportunity to create a European political space that will allow us, while waiting for these negotiations, to engage in a sensible structured political dialogue with the countries which wish to join the European Union in the shorter or the longer term. I will conclude by saying that, above all, we should remember that this is a political process, not a technical one. It will require political courage and political decisions. Once we get the single currency on the road we must give every ounce of our political energy to making enlargement work for the benefit of the European continent.
875503 author: Sarah Green:  Mr President, the Socialist Group warmly welcomes the report from Mr Gasliba. It is an extremely timely and very important report. At the moment we talk largely about monetary union. This report allows us to urge the Commission and the Council to turn this into a truly economic and monetary union. Of course we need strengthened economic coordination within the European Union as we enter these final thirteen months of the approach to EMU.  I want to address a number of points in Mr Gaslibas excellent report. The first is the issue of the Euro Council. I would like to make it very clear that the Socialist Group supports, and has always supported, the idea of a strengthened Euro Council to help bring about greater economic coordination within the European Union. But I have to say that many of us are dismayed at the moment at the way in which a number of countries now believe that the Euro Council should in fact merely be an informal intergovernmental Council, not only excluding certain Member States of the European Union, but excluding the Commission and also excluding the supervisory role of the European Parliament.  This Parliament has never supported nor will ever support, an arrangement  whether you call it a Council for stability or whatever  which stands outside the Treaties of the European Union. We want to see a Euro Council that is going to strengthen the economic coordination of the European Union but, for heavens sake, we ask the Council to make sure this is an Euro Council for the long term in Europe, that is going to help to give some economic governance to Europe. It must be transparent, accountable to this Parliament and involve the Commission. Anything else will be judged with great scepticism by the people of the European Union.  I would like to address the issue of the broad economic guidelines and address my remarks in particular to the Commissioner and the representatives from the Commission. The broad economic guidelines are the mechanism by which we can guarantee much greater economic coordination. The European Parliament really wants to work with the Commission over the next couple of months to redesign the broad economic guidelines, to redesign the annual economic report of the European Union so that it means something to our people. It must be written in a way that people understand and is relevant to the real economy. That means it must look at issues like employment. We want synchronization between the broad economic guidelines and the employment guidelines that will now form an important part of our strategy within the European Union. I would ask Commissioner WulfMathies for a guarantee that over the next few weeks we can work together to reshape the way in which these reports are prepared so that they are relevant to the future.  I should also like to raise the matter of the participation of national parliaments in this process. It would be churlish of the European Parliament to believe that we are the fount of all knowledge and democratic accountability in this process. National parliaments will set their national budgets and we must make sure that we have a process of collaboration between the European Parliament and national parliaments as we move towards greater economic coordination. It is a challenge to this House to work out a system of cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament so that all democratic institutions participate in guaranteeing that economic and monetary union is a success. National parliaments will play an important role. I hope we can come forward with ideas next year on how our relationship with national parliaments can be strengthened. Mr Gasliba mentioned the issue of asymetric shock. We have largely ignored this question. The Commission has ignored it and so has the Council. We have to face up to and be prepared for the fact that at some point we run the risk of some sort of asymetric shock occurring within the European economy. What will the mechanisms be for dealing with this potential problem in the future? Mr Gaslibas report asks the Commission to come forward urgently now with a report addressing how we start to deal with this potential problem that might occur at some undetermined time in the future.  My last point concerns how this Parliament deals with its technical advice. In the United States the US Congress has an organization called the Congressional Budgets Office. It is a quasiindependent office that can look at the models proposed by the administration for budgeting, economic policy and can advise the Congress on what steps it should take or what advice the Congress should give to the administration. It is time in the European Parliament for us to have our own parliamentary budgets office that can look at the macroeconomic policies that are pursued in the European Union and give proper weighty advice to the Commission to ensure that our opinions are properly taken on board by the Commission and the Council.
697187 author: Alastair Finlayson:  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today voting on the European Parliaments opinion on an agreement which, significantly, was signed this very week, two days before this debate.  Parliament expressed its opinion on the substance of this agreement last June, with a clear majority. At that time I talked about the reasons why I considered that it did not accord with the spirit and letter of European legislation. European legislation was and is aimed at the total prohibition of all these cruel and inhumane methods of killing and trapping animals. Briefly, and apart from questions of cruelty, we are opposed to the nonselective nature of this type of trap. As you know, it is impossible to prevent the trapping of species which in principle are not supposed to be trapped, because the traps are not selective.  We also opposed the lack of any clear definition of (I quote the English term) conventional leghold restraining traps . We opposed the authorization of the use of any of these traps in water, rivers or lakes, as killing traps. At the same time, we were very strongly opposed to the fact that in the wording of the agreement the Commission had accepted a period of five minutes for animals trapped by these devices to agonize and die. I would point out to my fellowMembers that the Commissions proposal was thirty seconds. And it has accepted five minutes as a dying period for animals caught in killing traps.  This shows that the Commission wanted an agreement, rather than a good agreement, because the issue at stake was not to create any more problems with the commercial agenda between the United States and Europe, and between Canada and Europe, when there are already so many others. And that is why the Parliament has so often come out against the substance of this agreement. I would nevertheless like to state my own view at this point on the moment we have reached and on the tactical aspect of the agreement, since we are discussing its substance.  The European Union is this very day in the process of entering into a new agreement, this time with the United States of America. So far as I could see from the two texts I specially obtained, this agreement with the United States of America is even weaker than the agreement with Canada and Russia which we are now examining. This agreement with the United States of America is worse, because it allows more time, it gives the United States longer to prohibit the use of traps with jaws. And the worst thing of all is the question of supervision and implementation, because we all know that is in the hands of the authorities of the various States of the Union rather than those of the Washington Federal Government.  Lastly, this agreement is worse because in this era of spindoctors, when we look at what the American Press says about this agreement on the basis of the negotiators statements, we conclude that it is not the same thing as the European Press says on the basis of the information supplied by the Commission.  And in particular, with regard to the derogations, that is to day the possibility of nonimplementation of what is written into the agreement, I should like to ask the Commission what the American representative, Charlene Barshefsky, has already put in her letter to Minister Klaus Kinkel, where she says that these derogations will be applied in cases of extreme necessity and that they will be the same as in the agreement with Canada and Russia. And I would ask Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan in English:  Will the Commission kindly confirm that there are no derogations as far as the phasing out of conventional leghold traps is concerned? Further, I should like to ask Sir Leon what the Commission will do if the United States and Canada try to use the derogations.  I would point out to my German colleagues  who, I assume, are here in the House  that the letter in question was motivated by the very reasonable doubts expressed by the German Government on this agreement. My friends, if it had not been for pressure from the European Parliament we would not even have an agreement with Canada here today; because last January, as you know, there was an attempt in the CITES Committee to allow free exports from Canada, Russia and the United States before we even had an agreement.  If it had not been for this Parliament, the first version of the agreement, which is even worse than this one, would have been approved. If it had not been for the pressure of European public opinion, which we represent, the first versions of the agreements with the Americans would have been approved.  My friends, we must keep up the pressure. We have all expressed our views now on the substance of the agreement. It would be a tactical disaster if at this moment we were to adopt any position other than the rejection of this agreement.
2665925 author: Claire Brown:  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work. I joined this Parliament in  1989  and I was Parliaments first rapporteur, along with Mr Cox, on economic and monetary union. We have travelled quite a distance in terms of the technical work to finally complete this important project. If you look at these reports and the work that we have undertaken on economic and monetary union, despite the difficulties that we have had, including the economic downturn in the early  1990 s, we have now reached a point where the momentum behind economic and monetary union is unstoppable.  If you look at the biggest players in the financial services sector they have based their strategic decisions over the past few years on the assumption that EMU will indeed go ahead. We have seen recently a wave of mergers and restructuring that spread throughout the financial services sector. In the private sector as a whole there has been largescale investment in the updating of information technology systems and the retraining of staff. All this marks the transition to economic and monetary union on  1  January  1999 .  This demonstrates that when the European Union sets itself clear targets and when it sets itself realistic timetables, we can achieve great things in this Europe. Since it started its first phase in  1990  the EMU project has had clear targets. It has had a manageable timetable and, of course, that is why we will achieve the single currency on  1  January  1999 . In less than four months, the Council will take that final important decision, and as a Parliament we have to look beyond that decision of  2  May and the start of the EMU on  1  January  1999  and set ourselves a new agenda within the European Parliament. It is no good sitting here selfsatisfied with the fact that we have created the single currency; we have to see how we apply that single currency and what role it is going to have in our lives.  Today I would like to set out some of the priorities for my group over the coming years. We need to learn an important lesson from the financial turmoil in southeast Asia. A currency must be stable and we must be able to demonstrate its stability. Therefore the pact for stability and growth is extremely important indeed. We in this Parliament must make sure that it is applied rigorously so that we can protect the stability of our currency.  Secondly, our group wants to see greater steps made in economic coordination. I would say to the Commissioner today, because I know that his services are working on the annual economic report at the moment, that we would like to know exactly what the new annual economic report will look like. What will the broad economic guidelines look like in terms of building this new strengthened economic coordination? We would like to have a dialogue with you over the next couple of weeks to ensure that the broad economic guidelines for the future are what we actually require in this new European environment.  We want to ensure that the European Bank is independent. No one in this house would challenge that, but there is no reason why an independent bank should not also be accountable. We need to apply ourselves very carefully, particularly in the context of Mrs RandzioPlaths report, to how we make that bank accountable. It is our job here in the European Parliament to do that. That means, President, and I say this to you because you are a member of Parliaments Bureau, we need to restructure the committees of the European Parliament. We need a Banking Committee in the European Parliament that deals with financial services and which will deal with the European Central Bank in the same way that nations like the United States of America have a powerful Banking Committee. We in our group will pursue this over the next few months.  What will be the role of national parliaments in this whole new environment? Will we be so arrogant as to believe that we do not need to have a relationship with national parliaments? We need at least informally to build a relationship with national parliaments and I will be taking steps in the next few weeks to do this, hopefully with colleagues from across the Chamber. We should set up a European Economic Forum where national parliaments and Members of this European Parliament can meet to monitor carefully economic coordination and the role of the European Central Bank. I hope that some in this room will join in that endeavour.  My last point is in relation to the citizens and the consumer. We have done the technical work but we have not yet sold the message to the public. Our job as a European Parliament, your job as a Commission and the job of the Council is to make sure that between now and  1  January  1999 , and particularly  2002 , the citizens accept and welcome all the work that we have done and the creation of that single currency.
7670349 author: Philip McNabb:  Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his detailed explanation of the situation which faces us at the second reading, which I do not intend to duplicate tonight.  Instead, with respect to the few diligent souls still left in the Public Gallery at this hour, I would like to illustrate in a way that is particularly relevant to Members why we need to make some real progress both tonight and in the coming weeks to create a meaningful European network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases.  There is something that most Members do more often than most of our fellow citizens: we fly in aeroplanes. Put any two Members together and very soon they will start discussing departure lounges and airline schedules. We do not just fly around Europe, we often move through most of the corners of the globe. Throughout that globe there are some very risky places, and some of the risk for the unwary or the unprotected is caused by disease. The disease could be carried in the air, in liquids, bodies, articles or by insects. Yet in some of the European Union Member States, there are health rules at points of access, in others the rules are very different, despite frequent crossborder transits. On some airlines measures are taken to protect passengers  for example by spraying cabins  on others they are not. Information is made available in some states, sometimes accurately and accessibly and in a range of different languages based on a wide range of data. In such circumstances a close degree of cooperation and coordination makes common sense, not just for travellers and parliamentarians but for all our citizens who need protection in many more ways than the very simple small example I have just set out.  However, the common position returned to this Parliament offers a number of low common denominators. While agreeing the surveillance network means obligations on Member States, the Council has agreed unanimously only a more general flexible framework for information exchange and coordination of efforts. Even allowing for Treaty limitations, there are severe concerns that this will be completely insufficient. After all, the poor status quo brought about these proposals after initial reports showed the weaknesses. Five years later we still need progress. Hence the strength of the near unanimous votes in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection for the recommendations of the rapporteur.  Mr Cabrol has pursued his extra proposals with his usual vigour and diligence. It will be of great interest to see whether, assuming Parliament as a whole adopts the recommendation, as I hope it will, in the subsequent conciliation negotiations the minimal stance of the Council and the more progressive and realistic approach of the Commission  which I know places considerable importance on these proposals to the extent of unusually reserving its position  can be reconciled with the more forwardthinking proposals from this Parliament.  It may be that some are too far ahead of their time, and specific European structures may have to await the lessons of the future reports which we will now receive at even more regular intervals than we suggested at first reading.  I am pleased that at least some of our suggestions have already been incorporated. However, my group will be supporting the argument for a more clearly defined role for the European Union, which goes beyond a couple of officials keeping an eye on development of diseases within our boundaries, or simple supplementation of wider WHO or state networks which may or not be effectively implemented.  The Commission wants the power to be proactive, to study and act upon significant outbreaks wherever they occur and, given the draft Treaty commitments on coherent public health policies across Europe, to take proper coherent action where and when it is needed. It needs to be sure of accurate, fast, comparable data and that there are no weak links in the chain.  Finally, I hope the whole House will thank Mr Cabrol for pursuing his case. I now look forward to both the Council and the Commission negotiating seriously and urgently on all the amendments we support to help a meaningful, practical and effective network to be put in place, not to expand bureaucracy but to help tackle some of the worst diseases in the world.
4554897 author: Sebastian Jones:  Mr PresidentinOffice, it is the most tremendous pleasure for me to welcome you to the European Parliament today. As a British Labour MEP, I take delight in being able to welcome the first Labour Government Minister in this Chamber for over two decades.  (Applause from the left) As leader of the Socialist Group in this House, I know that Socialists, Social Democrats  and some other Members of this House as well  were mightily relieved to see the back of the previous government which was most hostile to, most dishonest about and most obstructive in the European Union.  (Applause from the left) On  4  May, just three days after the British general election, the Observer newspaper carried the headline Goodbye Xenophobia . The first positive message of the new government and from the PresidentinOffice in particular was towards the European Union. The Foreign Secretary is very welcome here. On  16  December  1992  at the conclusion of the last British Presidency my colleague and predecessor JeanPierre Cot addressed the then British Prime Minister and said:  At the outset of the British Presidency, I looked forward confident in my belief that those traditional British characteristics of fair play and efficiency would make it a success . He concluded:  the British Presidency has behaved less like an honest broker and more like a fervent partisan . Today I make a plea to the Foreign Secretary to ensure that this British Presidency will demonstrate that fair play and efficiency and restore British selfrespect and dignity in this House and in Europe.  But, more, we hope that this presidency, in seeking to carry out its priorities will demonstrate the drive, the vigour, imagination, flair and vision which has marked the first eight months of the governments stewardship of Britain. It will be no surprise to the Foreign Secretary or to this House that my group endorses the major policy priorities which he has outlined to us today as his plan of work for the next six months. Colleagues in my group will deal with that agenda  jobs, drugs, the environment, the foreign affairs agenda, in detail during the course of the debate today.  I want to raise just two issues in particular. Firstly, enlargement of the Union to Cyprus and central and eastern Europe. We welcome the PresidentinOffices commitment to open the process of enlargement in an inclusive and transparent way in March in London. I know that the British government believes in making hard choices. I want to ask the PresidentinOffice to take up the hard option which in our view accompanies the opening conference and that is to begin the process of discussing the complex issue which was not concluded at Amsterdam and which the Luxembourg summit at least had the grace to admit must be tackled. It is not popular or easy to raise what is often regarded as the navelgazing issues of institutional reform. But the simple truth is that the European Union will not work without greater qualified majority voting...  ...let alone the reweighting of votes, numbers of Commissioners and so on.  Similarly, the word is out that the reforms of both the common agricultural policy and the structural funds which you mentioned will simply not even begin until the end of this year when the German election is over. Nobody expects that these questions can be resolved in the next six months but please do not pretend that they just do not exist.  The second issue I want to raise is a the decision which must be taken on the euro during the first few days of May of this year. This Parliament, as the PresidentinOffice said, has a unique and very particular responsibility. It is the only Parliament in Europe which can have a direct relationship with the European Central Bank and which already has a direct relationship with Ecofin. This Parliament can exercise democratic control over the euro and the institutions which determine its success or otherwise.  On this side of the House we are determined that role will be carried out in a very hardnosed way. We call on the Council to look seriously at the proposals coming forward from Parliament to give the euro democratic legitimacy. The attitude of the British Presidency in supporting the right of this Parliament to give its view on the recommendations of Ecofin on which countries should be in the first wave of EMU has given a clear message of democratic commitment for which we are very grateful. I hope now that the PresidentinOffice will press his colleagues to support a democratic euro.  This presidency occurs at a crucial time  I have said it if the Foreign Secretary did not. It carries with it the hopes of those concerned for the future of Europe and, in particular, for our young people. We wish it well.  (Applause)
3327650 author: Alastair Finlayson:  Mr President, I warmly welcome the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom as PresidentinOffice of the Council to Parliament this morning. I wish him every success in his presidency on behalf of the people of Europe. I thank him for his very extensive address to Parliament. I endorse the priorities of the presidency, which he clearly outlined.  I strongly endorse the priority which the presidency proposes to give to the objective of showing the peoples of Europe that the European Union is working for them in practical ways. This objective will only be achieved if it can be clearly demonstrated to the majority of people that the European Union is relevant to their daytoday concerns and that the Union can contribute to finding solutions to the problems in our society.  The issue of most widespread concern at the present time is crime. There are very few people in any of our countries who have not themselves been the victims of criminal acts or whose families have not been affected by crime one way or another. Practically every night television news bulletins bring stories into our homes of more and more horrendous crimes being perpetrated by evil people, often against defenceless people in our society, such as young children or the very old. Large numbers of our people are concerned over their personal safety or the safety of their families. In many of our communities house breakins, muggings and violent attacks are considered to be more commonplace than had been the case years ago.  The underlying cause for a large proportion of these crimes is drug dependency and the abuse of illegal drugs. Illegal drugs seem to be readily available nowadays both in terms of quantity and variety, particularly to young people. The abuse of these drugs poses a serious health risk to impressionable young people who are persuaded to experiment with them. The drug dependency and addiction which ultimately follows for many of these people can only be satisfied through the proceeds of crime. It is this type of drugrelated crime which is posing a serious risk to many of our communities.  I believe that the European Union can make a major contribution towards tackling the scourge of drug abuse by concentrating its resources in a coordinated manner with the national authorities on tackling the international drugs trade.  The illegal drugs trade is now a sophisticated international business. The fight against this trade, if it is to be effective, must also be sophisticated and international in scope. Those of us who participated in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty had hoped that Europol would be the agency which would provide national authorities with the intelligence and information on money laundering, illegal drug production and smuggling, which they required to prosecute those responsible for the drugs being distributed to our communities. Many years later I am disappointed to see yet another presidency having to list as one of its objectives that of finishing the preparations for the establishment of Europol. The only people who could be happy with these disgraceful delays are those involved in the illegal drugs trade.  Nonetheless, I warmly welcome the British Presidencys commitment to getting Europol established and its interest in promoting international efforts to tackle the illegal drugs business. I will be supportive of any such proposals which come before this Parliament.  During the British Presidency decisions will be made concerning those countries which will be included in the first wave of participants in the single currency. While I appreciate that Britain will not be one of these countries, it is nonetheless important that all countries, even those not participating in the single currency from day one, should be actively involved in the preparatory and planning phases for the launch of the euro because of the potential impact of this currency on all our economies, whether inside or outside the single currency zone.  A critically important aspect of the launch of the new currency will be the attitude of individual citizens to the euro. The PresidentinOffice will recall the reticence, concern and even fearful response of many British and, indeed, Irish citizens to the decimalization of our respective currencies during the  1960 s. In the leadin to decimalization the importance of establishing a high degree of consumer confidence was perhaps not fully understood. I believe that the same risk exists today. It is vitally important that the European institutions, as well as national governments, undertake a comprehensive process of education amongst all sectors of the population and not just amongst the financial and business community, as seems to be mainly the case at present.  When the euro is launched it will be necessary to exchange money held in present currencies for the new currency. This requirement may well provide a useful opportunity for the authorities to identify the assets of criminals and to take appropriate action. I hope that the presidency will ensure that the initiatives necessary to identify criminal assets are put in place and in good time to avail of the opportunity.  The work programme submitted by the presidency suggests that efforts will also be made over the next six months to make progress in the negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy. Clearly the Commissions detailed proposals will need to be tabled before any significant progress can be made in this matter. Final agreement on reform of the CAP should be preceded by a lengthy and comprehensive debate spread over a number of presidencies. This reform will have major political significance, not just for our future relations with East European countries, but also for our rural areas, for food policy and for the millions of farmers and workers involved.  Finally, the presidency has identified environmental policy as one of its priorities. In this regard I would hope that it will give due consideration to resolving a longtime existing environmental problem of major concern to your neighbours in Ireland  the problem of continued discharges of radioactive material into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield complex.
7758191 author: Helen Cameron:  Mr President, this for me is a very historic day because  21  years ago to the day I was the only MP still here who spoke on the first ever UK Presidency  the last UK Labour presidency.  I notice from the Minutes that Mr Tomlinson spoke in the next debate and he is still here, but he was speaking as PresidentinOffice of the Council, not as a Member. So it is historic and I would like to start on a pleasant note by throwing a few bouquets at the PresidentinOffice, which might surprise him.  The first bouquet I am throwing is because of the introduction of PR for euro elections  a long awaited improvement in our lot. The opting into the social policy shunned by the previous government, the promise today of opening Council deliberations, something I spoke about  21  years ago, suggesting as I do now, that EP committee chairmen be invited to Council deliberations on relevant matters: I wait to see if that will be followed  21  years later. It is not a case of rock and roll so much as of a slow foxtrot.  I would like to praise also the enormous courage of Mr Cooks counterpart in government, Mo Mowlam, for her very brave actions with regard to Northern Ireland.  I would like to praise the European noises that are coming from the front bench. But I start now with a criticism about EMU.  It is an irony surely that in the moment when the decision is to be made as to who is to be in the first tranche, the UK has opted out, although it qualifies, and is not going to be in the first tranche. That to me is a lost opportunity. I would say to the PresidentinOffice that the train will start, it will travel well, and will it not be harder to clamber on the train once it is well in motion?  The Trade Union Congress, the CBI, the exporters of whom Scotland has very many, are all in favour of EMU. So I think that this is a great shame and I wonder if even yet it is not possible for the UK Government to change its mind?  Here is what President Crosland said  21  years ago today:  There was always in the context of EMU, a widespread hope that financial policymaking would pass from Member States to the Community and that the Community would transform from a customs union into a fully integrated economic union complete with its Central Bank, a single fixed exchange and a growing harmonization of taxes. It is a bit of a slow foxtrot, is it not?  While the UK has dithered, bereft of vision, the clock has ticked on and I think the failure of the UK to join EMU is a present tragedy.  On the social policy side I have another criticism. Is there much point in getting the advantages of the social policy, which we have always supported in the party I represent here, if Old Labours stance of defending the disadvantaged is to be abandoned? Disabled, single mothers, students  there is a Eurospeak that people criticize but there is also a New Labourspeak which I criticize. Meanstesting is now affluencetesting . Longtermism is meant to excuse the savage cuts of today.  I would like to turn to some practical questions on the priorities. We all have our favourite environmental issues, but I would urge that we enforce the code of conduct passed by this Parliament for substandard tankers which threaten all our coasts and have, in fact, caused enormous damage to many of our Member States. On unemployment, the EMAC committee on which I served has put forward that there should be a compulsory rule about late payment. That really would help to solve the problems of small businesses and we should look to the very small businesses where real jobs can be created in great numbers.  The PresidentinOffice did not mention fishing today. We have had a debacle of decades with the last governments sellout to Spain on fishing. But recently we had another one by this New Labour, with the sellout on the Fraga report. So, I ask the PresidentinOffice if he is still committed to the principle of relative stability? This is the fundamental question. And are flagships to be allowed to continue making a nonsense of the whole of the CFP as it was originally developed? Has he read the Duke of Edinburghs criticism this week of the onesided nature of fishing agreements between the EU and poor developing countries?  Members on all sides of this House and from all countries welcome the referendum, which must be another bouquet I throw at this government that the PresidentinOffice represents. But there is keen sadness about the broken promises: the direct relationship offered to the new Scottish Parliament with Europe has been watered down, the status of the Lnder has been watered down, the right to attend meetings if the Scottish interest was dominant has been watered down. On enlargement, can we solve it without an enhancement of the funding? I have an interest here as an Objective  1  area. Objective  1  is just beginning to work to redress hundreds of years of neglect of my area.  Lastly, my  23  years here have seen the reconciliation of the old rivalries of Europe which caused war, horror and devastation and by decades of patient dialogue we have created the habit of cooperation. That is a habit we must never take for granted.  (Applause )
9085974 author: Nancy MacLeod:  Mr President, the last time that Britain held the presidency of the European Union was in the second half of  1992 . Then the British Presidency was characterized by drift and vacillation, by lack of purpose and absence of vision. This time it will be different, very different. The British Labour Government has a clear, well thoughtout agenda, as we have heard this morning, an agenda which is designed to make the essential link to the peoples concerns and aspirations and European cooperation. Europe should not be about remote bureaucracy and abstract theories. Europe should be about joint approaches to common problems. It is about tackling the issues which affect the lives of ordinary people in all the Member States. It is because the British Government recognises this that the British Presidency is, I believe, so determined to pursue the priorities which have been outlined.  Quite rightly, at the top of the presidencys agenda is to reach agreement on which countries will qualify for Stage Three of economic and monetary union. A successful start of the euro is in everybodys best interests. Also at the top of the agenda is job creation and if there is any issue weighing heavy on the people of Europe it is surely the fact that there are over  18  million people unemployed throughout the Union. There can never be a true European Union when we have such high levels of unemployment. Unemployment causes personal misery, it undermines social cohesion, it eats at Europes very soul. What we have to do is to take forward the employment guidelines agreed at the Luxembourg Job Summit so that we have concrete action plans. Plans which will turn good words into practical deeds; encouraging entrepreneurship, promoting education, training and lifelong learning, improving employability, increasing equal opportunities. This is what is needed and I am sure that this is what the British Presidency will promote with vigour and with determination.  If Europe it to succeed in the global economy, we cannot be complacent or conservative. To win in the world we have to make the process of change a way of life. To be competitive we have to be innovative and to be innovative we have to be radical and forwardlooking. This means that we have to create a more effective single market, a market which, for example, embraces telecommunications and the energy sector. It means ending unfair state aids. It means encouraging small businesses and attacking red tape and it means ensuring that research and development is at the very cutting edge of our economic advance.  Another priority for the presidency is to launch the process of enlarging the European Union. Let us be clear that this is of tremendous importance to all the people of Europe. Enlargement will bring real benefits to both the existing Member States and the aspiring members. It will bring mutual economic rewards and deliver greater security and stability. But, as we all know, for enlargement to work, the European Union itself has to change. Agenda  2000  is a good startingpoint. Now we have to have a serious debate about how we can develop a new regional policy to meet the needs of the future, and how of course we are going to reform the common agricultural policy. If modernisation is needed anywhere it is here.  The emphasis which the presidency will place on enlargement is, I believe, indicative of how the presidency wants the European Union to look beyond its current borders. In a similar vein the presidency should be congratulated on its determination to improve the Unions common foreign and security policy, the emphasis which it is placing on agreeing an new negotiating mandate for the Lom convention, and on its desire to give human rights the attention which is required.  The British Presidency has indeed set itself an ambitious agenda. It includes a wide range of issues, issues about which people are desperately concerned. In my experience the international menace of the drugs trade is undoubtedly one of those issues of greatest concern to the people of Europe and I for one warmly welcome your commitment, Foreign Secretary, to take up this fight in earnest. It is indeed heartening to hear also your commitment this morning to work with the European Parliament. I can assure you that the European Parliament is more than happy to work with you. Partnership, consensus, cooperation are our joint words, we share a common approach to Europes development.  Finally, I wonder if I could conclude with a personal note. At the end of the presidency the European Summit will be held in my constituency, in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. I am delighted that this will be the case and I am confident that at the end the presidency we will see a Europe which is more confident, a Europe which is more dynamic, a Europe which is more relevant and a Europe which once again has the full support of our people. Let us all work together to ensure that the Cardiff Summit is the peoples summit.
8340009 author: Alastair Jones:  Mr President, we very much welcome the opening of the British Presidency of the European Union. Although the Labour Party has changed its mind six times on our membership of the EU since we joined  25  years ago, for the last few years it has been fairly consistent. I hope the UK Presidency will be a great success.  Before I come back to the presidency, I should just like to deal with one or two remarks made by Mr Cook in his speech. It is extraordinary that he should talk about bringing the European Parliament closer to the people when his government is about to impose a system of proportional representation on the United Kingdom which is, as I understand it  and we are still waiting to find the definition  a closed list system. Although this is relevant to the European Parliament and although I know that Mr Cook is a longtime proponent of PR, would he agree with the attitude taken by his colleague, Mr Straw, the Home Secretary, that the electoral regions will be very large, and that it is highly unlikely that an individual candidate will be known by more than a fraction of the electorate in that region? Voters cannot, therefore, be expected to make an informed choice between candidates of the same party. That in itself speaks volumes about the Labour Partys attitude toward the European Parliament.  I should also like to say that the fact that two Members of the European Parliament have now to leave the Labour Party in order to speak freely, one sitting with the Communists and one with the Greens  one who told me this morning that he was expelled by fax  suggests to me that the controlfreak tendencies of the Labour Party are now becoming known to people in Europe as a whole. I would add that, since we are all concerned about candidate selection, quoting from the Conservative Partys own manual on candidate selection, it says:  Edmund Burkes words still hold good today. Your representative owes you not his industry only, but his judgement and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. Authoritative instructions, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, though contrary to the dearest convictions of his judgement and conscience, are utterly unknown to the laws of the land and against the tenor of our constitution. The Conservative Party will stand by those principles, unlike the Labour Party, which...  (Murmurs (of dissent) ) we understand, will allow the National Executive Committee to make the rankings, the order of the list and the selections in toto , in secret and impose those candidates on the United Kingdom.  (Murmurs (of dissent) )I am going to return to the presidency because that is what I am expected to speak on.  Conservatives largely agree with the governments priorities for the presidency: enlargement, jobs, cleaning up the environment and the fight against crime. These are all important policy objectives that we too would have put high on the agenda. We hope progress will be made on enlargement. It is a historic challenge. We have a moral duty to embrace the people of Eastern and Central Europe who lived under a cruel and alien tyranny for so long. Enlargement is in all our interests because it will dramatically increase the single market. Indeed, one of the many reasons why the Treaty of Amsterdam left so much to be desired was its total failure to get to grips with this challenge. On enlargement, Labour has a clear objective for the presidency and the setting of a detailed timetable for those applicants in the first wave. I hope they succeed, despite the fiasco of the treatment of Turkey at Luxembourg.  Britains record on jobs is far better than the European average. Unfortunately, Labours approach to this question is likely to lead to more unemployment, not less. Any party that can contend that signing up to the social chapter and the regulations made, and to be made under it, increases flexibility in the marketplace does not deserve to be taken seriously. Europe needs to tackle head on the unpalatable truth that unless we cut our social costs and free up our labour markets, we will be outpriced and outperformed by the rest of the world. Unacceptable levels of unemployment will persist. Red tape and regulation are luxuries Europe can no longer afford.  I have been distracted during the course of this address. I have had far more reaction from this Assembly than Mr Cook did earlier on. His speech was heard in almost total silence.  (The President cut the speaker off)
2796450 author: Sarah Cameron:  Madam President, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to begin by expressing my wholehearted support for this proposal for a directive amending the original directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers. It is another positive step in the improvement of both safety at sea and the protection of our very important marine environment. Bearing in mind that over the past decade we have lost some  12 ,  000  lives at sea throughout the world  and, indeed, continue to lose more than  200  ships a year throughout the world, we in the European Union need to be constantly on guard to enhance and improve the standards of safety at sea.  The essential essence of this directive is to address the human factor. As the rapporteur, Mr Parodi, quite rightly pointed out, some  80   of maritime accidents are attributable to human error and therefore this key issue should play an important part in our maritime strategy to enhance safety and protect the environment. It is vital that seafarers receive the necessary high level of training and certification in order to reach the level of competence and skill needed during their service at sea, to be able to communicate effectively with the crew, follow instructions and advice and, on occasion  all too often I fear  deal with crisis situations. Vessels must be crewed by seafarers who possess the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge.  This current proposal seeks to incorporate the requirements of the  1995  Convention on the standards of training of certification and watchkeeping for seafarers. I would like to congratulate the Commission not only for keeping pace with international maritime law but transposing it into Community legislation to ensure that it is effective throughout our European waters. I hope that the Commission will continue to maintain this pace of improving safety at sea. This proposal for a directive seeks to include the new training and certification requirements, including watchkeeping requirements and to introduce common criteria for the recognition of seafarers certificates issued by third countries.  Like Mr Parodi, I was pleased that the Council, with the support of the Commission, has incorporated most of the ideas and objectives of the European Parliament in the first reading. I am pleased to say that Mr Parodi successfully managed to further clarify and enhance the Commission proposal, removing uncertainties and simplifying the text. I was particularly impressed with the emphasis which the rapporteur put on the need to attract young people into the maritime profession and to promote the employment of seafarers. In its recent communication Towards a Maritime Strategy , the Commission indicated that there is a worldwide shortage of qualified and able seafarers. Developing a European policy to bring young people into the profession is a vital means of providing both highquality seafarers and helping resolve the problems of unemployment in Europe, not least in our maritime communities.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur on the importance he placed on having a common working language to be able to work effectively and, in particular, handle crisis situations. I look forward to the implementation of this directive in Member States as another positive move in our campaign for maritime safety.  I would conclude by urging the Commission to ensure that this amendment to the directive is implemented, is transposed and is enforced by the Member States. We have recently had a report that some  60   of all transport internal market directives have yet to be transposed by the Member States. Perhaps the Commissioner would like to comment on how best we can ensure that this very worthy directive is not only supported here in this House, implemented by the Council but is actually implemented on the ground by the Member States and their enforcement agencies. Indeed, I would like to see some mechanism whereby we can have a regular reporting mechanism to ensure that safety standards throughout the EU are not only maintained but are implemented and enforced at a high level.
5310583 author: Sebastian Merx:  Mr President, my group is very aware of the responsibility it bears in this debate today. Within this group we have Members of Parliament who represent nine socialist and social democratled governments in this Union, and these parties are in government in three more of the  15 . We do not pretend that it is easy to find a common position, given the range of views which are represented not just in those  12  governments but also amongst the people of the European Union whom we represent. But I want to pay tribute to my colleagues who have striven to find principles which are common to us all and which unite us in this, one of the most difficult lifeanddeath decisions this present Parliament has had to confront since  1994 .  Firstly, we must remember that we, in the European Parliament, do not dispose of armies, aeroplanes, bombs or aircraft carriers. Let us be entirely honest; we do not even have a common foreign and security policy worth its name. We have made our criticism about the lack of progress of the CFSP quite clear in recent years and, particularly, our dissatisfaction at the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty in this respect. So I think we need to demonstrate a little humility when it comes to decisionmaking in this field, and show some support for those of our colleagues, of all political persuasions, who will be confronted with the decisionmaking on this issue in national parliaments; those who will really have the awesome responsibility for the lives of their fellow citizens under arms and those of the many thousands of Iraqi citizens who are at risk. With all of this in mind, my group has just three main strategic political points which it wants to make in this debate.  Firstly, we insist absolutely that Saddam Hussein must comply fully with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and allow the unrestricted and unconditional access of the UN weapons inspection teams to all locations on Iraqi territory. There can be no compromise on this. These UN resolutions on Iraq represented a real step forward by beginning the process of monitoring and verifying disarmament. The UN showed what the future could hold in determining a safer world. If we were then, and are now, serious about this work, we must not allow Saddam Hussein to flout the international community.  Secondly, my group believes that the only body legitimately responsible for this policy is the United Nations. We want to give our wholesale support to the UN and, in particular, we thank the Secretary General for the hard work and commitment he has shown in his attempt to solve this crisis through diplomatic and political pressure. We wish him well on his mission to Baghdad. We believe that it is the role of the United Nations Security Council to come together at this time to reconsider the Iraqi problem.  I must tell you that there are some in my group who believe passionately that the United Nations, and only the United Nations, should decide what happens next. They argue against any military action without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council. Whilst they do not represent the majority in my group, be in no doubt that they do not argue that case from any weakening resolve to enforce existing UN resolutions; nor because they want to give Saddam Hussein any hope that he will be able to escape our determination to remove from him any potential to damn the region and the world with his weapons of mass destruction. Rather, they argue the need for a fresh UN mandate because they fear to inflict death and destruction on Iraqi civilians, who are the real losers in this; because they also fail to understand the objectives of a military strike against Iraq; and because they genuinely fear that a precipitate military strike may initiate a conflagration in the Middle East that would kill and destroy on scale not seen for many years. There is not one member of my group who does not share those dreads.  For the great majority, however, we believe that the United Nationsled drive for a political and diplomatic solution must be the focus for our parliamentary action at this moment.  Thirdly, my group is committed to the foodforoil programme and the additional programme which Kofi Annan has proposed to support the Iraqi people.  I know that next Monday,  23  February, the General Affairs Council has the situation of Iraq on its agenda. I hear you saying that the Presidency has kept partners in the European Union informed. In our view, information is not enough. Parliament needs the Council to find a common position for the European Union. We recognize the difficulties; we recognize the lack of precision and real competence in the Treaty on European Union; but our Union is, if anything, a real model of conflict resolution.  Please use every ounce of strength and vision which the Presidency can muster to give the European Union a leading role in the world on this issue. Give us a European Union of which its people can be proud. And please show us that the European Union means more than words in a treaty.
4207059 author: Frederic Jones:  Mr President, first of all, just to clarify: we are tonight debating safety standards for cabin crew and not air traffic controllers. At least I hope so. I know it is very late but I believe that is the directive we are discussing, otherwise I am in the wrong room. I think we have a problem with interpretation, with all due respect to Mr Grosch.  I wish to thank him for his efforts in endeavouring to steer this report through Parliament and doing such a comprehensive job, and also to congratulate the Commission on having the foresight to bring this forward, particularly in the light of what we have just been saying about liberalization and the very important comments the Commissioner made about the need to underpin liberalization with a very strong social framework. This is clear evidence that is actually happening, and this is a measure which commands the full support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.  One point we have to stress is that we need to get over to the Council and, indeed, the wider community why this measure is so important. One thing we have to make very clear is that, contrary to accepted beliefs, if you are involved in an air crash the likelihood is that you will not actually die. Indeed, many aircraft accidents are survivable. Around  75   of aircraft are involved in accidents during approach, landing or takeoff. Research indicates that around  90   of all aircraft accidents could be survivable. It is estimated that of the  1   500  people on average who die each year, some  300  a year, on average, could survive if evacuation measures within aircraft were improved. I am confident that if we had better, faster and more effective evacuation, we could save lives  as many as  300  a year.  How do we do that? There are a number of methods by which we can improve evacuation measures. Firstly by the behaviour and crowdcontrol skills of cabin crew during emergency evacuations, and, secondly, by passengers knowledge of safety procedures and their motivation to get acquainted with them. We all know from our experience in flying that noone takes any notice whatsoever of cabin crew when they are giving us the safety demonstrations and yet all the evidence suggests that information they are conveying to us could make the difference between life or death. There are a number of reasons why evacuation is a key issue, and training is clearly a means by which we can enable and motivate the cabin crew to provide effective information to the passengers, before, during and after an incident. That is why we believe this measure is so important.  The large majority of air crashes are survivable technically, and effective evacuation is so important. Current regulations, for example, specify that an aircraft must be evacuated within  90  seconds with just half the exits open. In  1994  research was carried out by both the CAA and the FAA which clearly indicated that the difference between getting out of the aircraft or not depended on assertive, highlytrained and highlyeffective cabin crew. Tonight we should reflect on that. It underpins the work of Mr Grosch and the proposal from the Commission. The results show clearly that trained cabin crew make the difference. That is the reason why we are very pleased to support this proposal for a directive on the training of cabin crew.  We have a number of concerns which we have identified via our amendments. We think that in an incident you cannot differentiate between some cabin crew who may have safety training and others who do not. All the crew should have the skills necessary to ensure that the plane, for example, is evacuated as quickly and effectively as possible. That is why we have tabled Amendments Nos  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16  and  17 , to ensure this measure applies to all the cabin crew. If you speak to the cabin crew themselves, they do not want to create a situation where, possibly, some airline operators could differentiate between cabin crew and create a twotier system.  In Amendment No  13  we propose annual medical checks for cabin crew. Again we think this is perfectly reasonable, when your life is effectively in not just the pilots hands but also in the hands of the cabin crews. An annual medical check is the best way forward. Leaving it just to the wording regular is not sufficient.  Finally, Amendment No  18  talks about annual training for cabin crews, including things like firefighting and the use of life rafts. Again, it is extraordinary that a basic requirement like using firefighting equipment or life rafts is not checked annually. That is why we are tabling this amendment, to ensure that training is given on an annual basis.  In conclusion, as travel demand increases, the number of aircraft increase, the number of risks increase, it is vital that safety standards throughout the Community are harmonized. We believe this directive will ensure that and could make the difference between life and death itself.
2387590 author: Annette Whittacker:  Mr President, I have a worry about my own mental health (since this topic was mentioned this morning) when I can get excited by something that says Special Report  597  of the Court of Auditors on the management of the Communitys cereals trade involving export refunds, special import arrangements and regional aid scheme together with the Commissions replies . But it is one of those reports which are worth reading. It is succinct and to the point. The Court of Auditors have done a really good job in highlighting the problems that we have in this area, as Mrs Theato has stated.  However, it is not as good as previous special reports on the very same issue. The one that caught everyones attention was when we were giving extra export refunds for exports from Germany, and ships were coming with grain into Germany, unloading, reloading the same grain, going away and getting monies for it. That showed the total folly of the system, but the flaws persist. Here we have export refunds from the period  19911994  totalling over ECU  11  billion. That amount was actually more than the total spent on training, social policies, research and development, and antipoverty programmes. These monies were going through that scheme with a number of mistakes as well as a number of unsatisfactory practices.  There are two points I want to highlight. Firstly, on the POSEIMA schemes where we had monies going to the Azores. When you read the report it is absolutely incredible how such monies could be spent in that way. Flaws and defects in the programme were revealed which would warrant it being overhauled. I am sure the Commission would agree with that. One can only endorse the Courts finding that with the current system, factors irrelevant to the special requirements of the POSEIMA scheme will dictate aid levels. It is absolutely unbelievable that we could have been paying money out in the way we did under those conditions.  I now wish to dwell on the area which covers comitology, an area in which I have quite an interest. This ECU  11  billion was actually managed by a management committee over which Parliament has no control, no right of scrutiny and about which we have great difficulty in obtaining information. Not too long ago, when the price of cereals actually reached record highs on the world market, the management committee stopped export refunds. Fine, but we were never consulted or asked whether it was the right thing to do. After all, it is only a couple of billion ECU!  During the couple of months when it was suspended, that money would have served to finance the rural development which Commissioner Fischler is trying to promote, and to reconvert our spending in CAP. When the refunds returned, once again Parliament was not consulted. No consultation, no information, just a fait accompli . I do not think this is the right way for Parliament to operate when it comes to agriculture, but I know I am digressing on that. The Commissioner may ask what that has to do with this report? It has a lot to do with the report. It is about the way the management committees operate.  I have to laugh that the opinion from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development says that Parliament is not in a position to monitor the activities of the management committees. If that is the case, it shows the inadequacy of the present system. We have  79  agricultural management committees. That was the figure given when I did the budget. In  1994  alone, the management committees took  4 ,  679  acts. That is a lot of legislation and money.  The report is calling for transparency, and that is exactly what we should be doing. I am pretty sure the Commissioner would support that approach. We have to change our method of operating. We have to change the way we spend our money in agriculture  away from export refunds, away from this comitology structure which deals with these large amounts of money. We need a system that is more transparent, with fewer loopholes, fewer shortcomings.  I honestly think that the next special report should be a darned sight better than the previous ones. Commissioner Fischler will, of course, have a lot to say about that and how that comes about. He knows that he will have the support of this Parliament when he tries to bring about those changes because they are essential.
5148079 author: Frederic Green:  Madam President, Mr Schulz has already made the important point that, indeed, we must improve the procedures in this House. I will not come back to it. I just wish to add one point. Why can we not interrupt the sittings before the vote at  12  noon five minutes beforehand to let everybody come into the Chamber? Then we will have an orderly debate. What we experienced before was shameful and I really would like the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents to look into the matter.  Mr Bontempis report is characterized by a pragmatic and very instrumentalist approach. Principles are fine but progress in concrete matters is essential. We are faced here with, you might say, the positive side of negative integration. We have here one of the Commissioners who is working closely on the sideeffects of the internal market. Everybody will soon be able to move freely around Europe except police and justice officials. That is the heart of the matter. It is very important that finally Member States are beginning to realize that a purely intergovernmental approach is not there simply to protect national interests but, at the end of the day, stands in the way of national justice. The intergovernmentalist approach for the last  50  years was exemplified by the Council of Europe. This is an important organization, but we all realize that justice and police cooperation in a Europe of  15  Member States without borders can no longer be achieved by ratifying national conventions which come too late, do too little, and have only partial effects. It is this essential point which Mr Bontempi so rightly highlights in his report.  It is not a question of wanting to do away with democracy and national constitutional guarantees. The European Union has become mature enough with its emphasis on human rights and protecting democracy, for progress to be made.  The Amsterdam Treaty  Mr Bontempi makes this quite clear  shows the way forward. We can no longer work within the national conventions as if the European Union were simply an intergovernmental structure. That is the heart of the matter. This morning Mrs Gradin, in her initial response, made it quite clear that framework decisions should be the priority instrument in future for making progress.  I say this with great emphasis because it is the only way finally to involve also the countries of central and eastern Europe. We must make more progress in this whole area if we are going to have an adequate reception of central and eastern Europe into the present European structures. If this Europe, the Europe which we have been building for the last  40  years, cannot make more progress in justice and police cooperation how can we expect countries which, for  40  years, have been suffering from dictatorship, lack of protection of human rights and lack of institutionbuilding to really come in with us and make the progress which we jointly want?  It is essential and I would ask Commissioner Monti, who is standing in for Mrs Gradin, to say whether the PHARE programme should not be far more used to promote justice and police cooperation. This is also in the spirit of Mr Bontempi.  It still remains disgraceful that neither the national parliaments nor the European Parliament are really involved. This point has been made before; we should not be defensive. There is no way forward except for the national parliaments and the European Parliament to make more efforts to work jointly in this area. The political will which is so often lacking in making progress should be made clear, both on the national side and on the parliamentary side, in this House. The European Court of Justice, which has been the pearl of the institutions, still has an inadequate role in this whole process. The Court can only give preliminary rulings if members so choose and even then it cannot really give an interpretation of the Treaty. It is limited to framework decisions and decisions on the various conventions. We must make progress in this field as well and it is again a point made very clearly by Mr Bontempi.  In short we really can do a lot more together but the central point remains that the political will on the part of the Member States is sometimes used as an alibi. The approach of protecting national interests is an alibi for making progress at European level. Against that we should strongly protest and it is that element which underlines Mr Bontempis approach; we welcome it very much. I hope also that the Commission will take it seriously for the current period.
7723303 author: Marc Bauer:  Madam President, if Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop can wax lyrical at this late hour I am sure you will allow me a little bit of levity if I say first of all that Commissioner Liikanen has virtually stolen my speech. He said the things that I was going to say and when he began by saying that this is a budget which is surrounded by serenity, following Barbara Dhrkops analogy with playing a piano. I am reminded of Eric Morecambe, the great comedian from the UK who is now dead.  There was a sketch where Eric Morecambe is playing and is making a real honkytonk noise. It sounds absolutely awful and Andr Previn says,  you are playing all the wrong notes,  and Eric says,  I am playing the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order. That has always seemed to be the way we have done the budget in the past, and Barbaras analogy with playing a piano is not too far out, because this year is different.  I said it when Helen Liddell first came to the Budgets meeting. We do not deal with the Commission like this  we even had a Scots interpreter in the English language booth doing it with a Scots accent for Helen Liddell. It seems that everything is going so well and that is good. I think it shows the partnership that is being developed and a maturity towards the budget from the three institutions involved.  On Mr Violas report, I think we have to say that the fact that it is unamended and went through Committee unamended shows the consensus from all the groups as far as these guidelines are concerned  what we expect from the budgets of the other institutions. We congratulate Mr Viola on the work he has done and we hope that consistency will continue as we go through the year.  On the Dhrkop report on the adjustment of the financial perspective, the trialogue which occurred earlier this week, as Commissioner Liikanen said, has been extremely fruitful, carried out in an atmosphere of cooperation where the three institutions want to get a settlement. It is not an adversarial situation where we are trying to score points off one another; instead we are actually trying to get a budget which we can all agree to and this adjustment of the financial perspective. One hopes that when Mrs Liddell goes to the Council she can come back and report to Parliament that the additional resources that have been provisionally agreed can be agreed in total. It would be a major achievement if we could see that.  On the main report, the political group which I represent as coordinator supports it throughout  to such an extent that we wanted it to be kept, like Mrs Dhrkops, as short as possible. As to the amendments which have been proposed, we agreed last week not to support any amendments, and I say this mainly for colleagues like Mr Brinkhorst. We see nothing wrong with his Amendment No  1 , but we actually think it is better placed within the first reading. On this occasion we would not be inclined to support it. Having said that, several of my colleagues see no reason why we should not support it, and I remain to be persuaded that we should support it between now and voting time tomorrow; so do not give up hope yet, Mr Brinkhorst. If we do vote against, let me make it clear that it will not be because we disagree with the content of that report, but because we took a stand to keep this report as short as possible. We can apply that to many other amendments, but please try to understand that it is not for dogmatic reasons, it really is a matter of simplicity.  It is a budget, as Commissioner Liikanen said, of prudence: we use the terms a citizens budget and a taxpayers budget in the same sentence and I think that is what we are trying to achieve with these guidelines. When we look at the priorities, as far as our group is concerned the main priority is about job creation, about creation of employment; no matter how we do it, whether it be through infrastructure, whether it be through research and development, whether it be through support for small and medium enterprises. That is the thrust of our approach to this budget.  We also support the phrase Europe of knowledge which Mrs Dhrkop has introduced  one would expect her to give priority to education and training, having known her for many years; and we would want to see European funds spent in the area of education and training and research and development. The thrust of the report you can find in paragraph  8 , and I think we can give our full support to what it says there. At the end of the day it is about getting that agreement, about making sure that the three institutions are working together. And who knows, at this rate we may end up with one reading of the budget. Oh that it were so!
798201 author: Mary Merx:  Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop and Mr Viola, on having produced guideline resolutions which are just that. They are guidelines and they have strenuously resisted what so often happens if people try to turn the guidelines into some sort of advance and premature first reading. What we have here is a very clear view of principle.  I merely want to refer to a couple of paragraphs in Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkops excellent report and underline them, in particular recital D where she emphasizes that what we have to concentrate on in the budget procedure is the whole question of the collection of revenues so as to avoid wastage. We spend so much time dealing with expenditure that we have to prioritize the proper collection of own resources as a major, fundamental and integral part of the budget procedure.  The other point I would highly commend her for is the incorporation in paragraph  9  of her report of the response to the challenge laid down by Commissioner Liikanen some two years ago about the policies of critical mass. Today in the guidelines motion he has Parliaments response, and we hope that, having had Parliaments response, we get preliminary draft estimates that reflect that response in a way that we can see. If you read paragraph  9  carefully, Mrs Dhrkop has there accepted the challenge that it means looking at those policies which should be continued and even reinforced, but also at those which should no longer be thus considered. So it has bitten the bullet, it is a serious response, and one which I commend.  For the rest of my time, I want to turn to Mr Violas report which, again, is excellent. The points I would underline in his report are as follows: in paragraph  4  he makes the very important point about the European civil service. I hope when we are talking about the European civil service as we proceed into the detail of the budget, we will perhaps extend some of the thoughts set out there and talk about both appointment and promotion being exclusively actions which should take place on merit. This should be the only criterion for appointment and promotion within the European civil service. I note and welcome in paragraph  5  the view that no new post ought to be created in  1999 , and I hope that, as we progress into the budgetary procedure, the caveat expressed there is one that can be dropped.  I commend very fully all the points that are laid out in clear chronological sequence in paragraph  8  of the report, where there are a whole series of matters on which this House, as part of the budgetary authority, needs further information.  I particularly turn to paragraph  9   property policy. Today, as has already been recalled, is  1  April. I received, I suppose, what has been the most complicated April Fools Day hoax in the form of what purports to be a report to the European Parliament from the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, a report that would have us believe that something like ECU  36  million is going to be spent on converting the Belliard I and II buildings to meet their purpose. I say to them: nice try on April Fools Day but we look forward to receiving the genuine report on what should be made available for the conversion of those buildings.  Yet there are serious challenges before us in the buildings area, and I am sure that, in the approach that Mr Viola is taking, he will continue with the same level of serious scrutiny as we have had in the past.  The only area that I see seriously lacking in the Viola report  but I think we can take it for granted  is in relation to communications policy. We have lots of discussions coming up on communications policy. I just want to add one thought, and I say it with great respect to you, Madam President, as something you can take back to the Bureau. I am increasingly of the view that to understand what Parliaments Bureau actually does and decides you have to be a Kremlinologist to read their minutes and get any meaning out of them. So at this time when we are talking about communications policy, you can perhaps translate into the Bureau minutes the same degree of clarity, lucidity and transparency that this Parliament is trying to instil into the European Central Bank. It would be a great service to parliamentary democracy.
1519697 author: Michael McNabb:  Mr President, I have to say that I am very pleased that the leadership of my own group has asked me to speak for the group today because I am quite sure that the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland would want me to speak for them today to express their deep gratitude to all of the European institutions for the powerful strength and support that they have given to the peace movement on our streets.  Could I begin by expressing their gratitude, and my thanks, to you for representing this Parliament and coming to our streets and thereby strengthening the will for peace and the mood for peace by showing the people on the streets, who have been neglected for so long, that Europe and the outside world really did care. That strengthened enormously the will for peace among the people. In so doing you are building on the strong foundations, already laid by the European Commission, and let nobody underestimate the strength of those foundations.  When the ceasefires were called, Jacques Delors approached us immediately to ask what he could do to help and he initiated the special programme for peace and reconciliation. His successor, President Santer, came to our streets to meet with people at local level and, of course, the fact that the President of the European Commission came to the streets was an enormous statement, not only of goodwill but of positive support for the peace process and of strength for that process.  The fact that his colleague the Commissioner for regional policy with major responsibility for Northern Ireland, Monica WulfMathies, has come to our streets many times and has gone to the areas of highest unemployment and has brought together people from both sides on their common ground  economic regeneration  has been a very important factor in the healing process that we believe is now under way. Of course, the two governments who are represented here today and in particular the two people who are representing them who have been involved in very detailed work during the talks leading to the agreement have put enormous efforts into it, together with previous governments who have also made very strong moves towards peace in our country.  We have, I believe, an historic opportunity now for a new beginning in which we can leave behind us our terrible and tragic past. It is a new beginning in which there will be no victory for either section of our people because in divided societies victories are not solutions.  What we have is an agreement that underlines and proposes accommodation and respect for the identities of both sections of our people and for the ethos of both sections of our people and creates the circumstances in which both sections of our people can work together in their common interests and by so doing can break down the barriers of the past. There again, we see the enormous influence of the European Union because, as I have often said the European Union has been a major inspiration to the philosophy of creating peace. People often talk of European Union as economic this and economic that, but fundamentally, as I have often said on my streets, it is the finest example in the history of the world of conflict resolution.  Just imagine fifty years ago: for the second time in a century, after millions has been slaughtered, who could have forecast we would be altogether today? But we are. How was it done? How it was done involves the philosophy I am talking about, not just in Northern Ireland but in every area of conflict in the world because at the end of the day all conflict is about the same thing  it is about seeing difference as a threat.  (Applause) The peoples of Europe decided that difference  whether it is your race, your religion, your nationality or your ethnicity  is an accident of birth and not something that you should fight about; it is something you should respect. Looking at the philosophical principles that create peace, what the peoples of Europe did was to build institutions  and those three institutions are represented here today  which fully respect the differences of their peoples. No one in Europe has lost their identity but, and this is the important point, make them work together in their substantial common interests which are social and economic, as I often say spilling their sweat and not their blood , and by doing that we can breakdown the barriers and centuries and the new Europe will have evolved.  Those are the principles that go to the heart of this new agreement if you read it. They are creating institutions within Northern Ireland and between North and South and between Britain and Ireland that respect our differences but which allow us to work together in our common interests based on partnership, on equality, on mutual respect, on consent and agreement. As we lay those foundations now, as the two governments have laid those foundations for us by their work for this agreement, let us hope that by working together the real healing process in Ireland will begin and we will break down the barriers of prejudice of centuries and the new Ireland will evolve in the way the new Europe has but with no victory for either side but based on agreement and respect for diversity.  Indeed, Mr President, as that is happening I have no doubt that the continued support from the European Union and from the European Commission and Council of Ministers in particular, through economic regeneration, will play a major role in strengthening the common ground enormously and in expressing to our people at grassroots level the massive international goodwill that exists for peace in the offshore island of the European Union. The representatives of all sections of our people face the challenge of harnessing that massive international goodwill and translating it into real benefits for our people and in doing it together to break down the barriers of centuries.  We look forward in Northern Ireland to continuing support from our friends in the European Union and we thank you for it. We are very confident, and I know I am speaking for the vast majority of our people from both sectors of our community when I say we are looking forward to laying our past permanently behind us. As we move into the next century let it be the first century in our island history in which we will have no killing on our streets and no emigration of our young people to other lands to earn a living.  (Loud and sustained applause)
2426656 author: Sebastian McNabb:  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the debate on trade and the environment is reaching a critical stage. Since the agreements were signed at the end of the Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organization was created, not one positive decision has been taken, even though this House and other legislative assemblies only agreed to ratify the Marrakesh Agreements because those agreements envisaged a package that included environmental matters.  Now, the mandate of the WTOs Committee on Trade and Environment originally contained  10  points, none of which has been the subject of a policy decision by the decisionmaking bodies of the WTO. In the absence of any decision by the policymakers, policy has been defined by the Panels, which are effectively the lawcourts of the World Trade Organization. This situation cannot be allowed to go on. Firstly, those bodies have no legitimate right to decide to set aside national laws of major importance in the field of the environment, health and consumer protection. We have seen the reaction to this situation in the United States Congress when the Clinton government had its fast track application refused. Secondly, the Panels themselves have acknowledged their limitations and requested guidelines from the policymakers of the World Trade Organization, and no such guidelines have been forthcoming.  And there are fundamental problems, Mr President, there is a problem over the objectives of the two policies. Environmental policy seeks to change the way people behave, the way citizens, corporations and countries behave. International trade policy merely aims to secure free trade in products or services, without allowing any distinction between products based on how they are made; that is to say, making no distinction between what are called otherwise like products in English. And this is a basic conflict we have to consider in terms of philosophy and policy.  Then there are conflicting laws. For example, the international conventions for the protection of the environment, such as CITES, the Washington Convention, which seeks protection for endangered species, has been torpedoed by a recent decision of the GATT Panel. Although it is possible and does not cost much to protect disappearing species protected under the CITES Convention, the GATT Panel has just decided that it cannot prevent the United States from importing shrimps caught by methods which risk causing the extinction of species protected by an international environmental law.  The WTOs lack of decisionmaking power also causes problems regarding sustainable development. We have had the banana Panel, which has caused some ACP countries very serious problems. We have ethical questions, as we have seen all too clearly in the fact that the European law on legtraps has been placed in doubt by a potential threat from a possible GATT Panel. We have questions concerning public health and consumer protection, like the decision on hormones in meat: Europe does not allow the use of hormones to fatten livestock, but they want to make us repeal that legislation. We have questions concerning the labelling of products, such as timber products from forests that are not under sustainable forms of cultivation, but the WTO does not allow us to distinguish between timber produced by destroying virgin forests and timber from sustainable plantations.  I would like to ask the Commission a direct question, and, to avoid any misunderstanding, I will ask it in English, so that the Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, Commissioner Marcelino Oreja and their technical advisers can understand:  I welcome the speech that Sir Leon Brittan produced in the Bellerive Globe Conference in Geneva. But I can only welcome its proposal for a highlevel meeting of ministers for trade and environment if two conditions are met. The first one is that this cannot be a delaying tactic. It must be included in the declaration of the forthcoming Geneva highlevel WTO ministerial conference in May. Otherwise it will not have enough political backing. Secondly, we need to have a clear position from the Commission about the idea of a special procedure before the Panel convenes in the case of a conflict between environment and trade in the WTO.  To be clearer, we want it to be more democratic, more open to the NGOs and to the outside world, to the experts on the environment before the socalled judges of a Panel start taking decisions on trade and environment. We want to establish two things here. Firstly, on the institutional level, a highlevel ministerial group for trade and environment that will give the necessary political impetus that does not exist today in the committee on trade and the environment. Secondly, on an operational level we want to have a predispute settlement mechanism where we can have participation of civil society, NGOs, environmental experts, to have some mediation before it reaches the time of decision.  I should also like to draw the Commissions attention to paragraphs  6 ,  8  and  10  where we ask for the creation of an eminent persons group to think about the most important philosophical questions, the warning we give in paragraph  8  and, finally, the urgency in creating the trade and environment ministerial group for sustainable development.  Mr President, I apologise for having gone on so long. This problem is getting close to breakingpoint and the Commission must be made clearly aware that the democratic representatives of the people are losing patience.
7438433 author: Lynne Green:  Mr President, I should first like to thank the PresidentinOffice of the Ecofin Council for his report to us today. I cannot let this moment pass without expressing my personal pleasure at welcoming to this plenary a British Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer...  ...and to ask him to take back to the Labour Government the congratulations of the Socialist Group for the first momentous year of Labour in government.  (Mixed reactions) As this Parliament takes its part today in seeing in the euro to  11  Member States of the Union, may I also welcome the positive and sensible approach taken by Gordon Brown with regard to the introduction of the euro in Britain. The careful preparations being made mean that those of us who support British membership  of whom I am one  will be able to conduct a campaign for a Yes vote with some confidence that there is a better balance to the advantages and disadvantages than was even thinkable under the last government.  Despite the fact that Britain is not to be in the first wave of entrants to the single currency, it fell to the British presidency to see the euro to its final stage. For those who doubted whether a country outside the currency should or could conduct this with integrity, rigour or, indeed, vigour, I hope they have heard yours and Prime Minister Blairs unequivocal statements, many times repeated, that the euro when launched must be a success, not just for those Member States in it  important as that is  but for all those who are not in it as well. The economies of the  15  are so closely and inextricably linked that any problems of the euro are not the problems of the  11  alone, but also those of Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece. Therefore, the euro must be successful and the British presidency committed itself to do all in its power to make it so.  At this point my group pays tribute to the work of the Commission in bringing this to fruition but also to the inspirational work of former Commission President Jacques Delors who has made such a remarkable contribution to Europe and the euro.  (Applause) The Socialist Group welcomes the fact that today  11  countries will be given the goahead to move forward to EMU. My group has always argued that we want as many Member States as possible to form part of Economic and Monetary Union from the outset. We do not agree that a euro of the  11  equals a weak euro. Just look seriously at the phenomenal convergence which has taken place in all  15  Member States, even those who are not joining now. Never before have so many countries striven of their own free will to reach the same targets at the same time and with such success. The scale of the project is unprecedented and shows what the European Union is capable of when the political will is there and when we decide to work together.  The EMU project has been immensely successful to date. It is right to acknowledge that and to pay tribute to the courage of those government leaders who have carried it through. We must, however, make clear today why it is more than ever necessary to secure a single currency. Some of our citizens fear the coming of the euro and its economic consequences. Many believe that the economic stringency of recent years and the consequent rise in unemployment are only as a result of the drive for the euro. We should accept that, to some extent, we have not given a clear picture of the global context in which the single currency becomes not just a tool for European integration but far more. As we have seen the global market expanding in the last  8  years, it has become clear that if we want to create a future for our young people for tomorrow, we must develop new, innovative strategies which will combat the negative consequences of the global market and the information society whilst harnessing the positive consequences. The single currency, with its potential for stability, greater certainty for investors, the savings inherent in transaction costs, price transparency and so on is one very important and innovative European opportunity. Perhaps we do not often enough say that single currency or no, the economy of the world is changing dramatically and working life as we know it is already different and will be even more so in five or ten years time.  So, today we begin a new phase. Yes, it is a challenging one. Yes, it is one with some dangers. But at least we have the courage and vision to imagine, plan, organize and create a new currency for Europe, a new chance for Europe. We all know that if the euro is to succeed in dealing with unemployment and falling living standards, it must be accompanied by policies for growth, job creation and investment. My group has argued and will continue to argue for greater cooperation and coordination of Member States economic and employment policies.  Finally, I want to make two points that are important to my group. Firstly, this Parliament has been deadly serious about our role in the introduction of the euro. No one can accuse us of causing harm to the concept or damaging any aspect of the process. Why? Because the money in our citizens pockets is much too serious to play games with. So, we now expect the Council to be just as serious in the next  24  hours in carrying out its side of the bargain and carrying out its obligation under the Treaty. We expect the Council to nominate the governor and the board of the Central Bank tomorrow in line with the Treaty  one governor for eight years. That is the first test of the euro and the Council must not fail it!  (Applause) Secondly, the damaging press speculation of the last few weeks about the governor and the political wrangling which is going on has demonstrated the sort of political pressure to which the Central Bank will be subjected. We all now know very clearly the sort of phone calls the governor will get in the middle of the night and we know where they will come from. It is even more important, therefore, that the lines of accountability are drawn very clearly from the Central Bank to this European Parliament. We here endorse the independence of the Central Bank as laid down in the Treaty.  But independence is not compromised by accountability. The concepts are quite distinct. The euro must operate for the good of all the Member States within the euro area and all the people therein. The only body with that panEuropean dynamic to hold the bank accountable is this European Parliament. Any governor worth his or her salt will understand that this Parliament offers a political counterweight to national political pressure and will seek to cultivate a good working relationship with this House as a matter of urgency. My group will clearly have an eye to this during our public hearings for the governor and the board in the coming weeks.  Today is a day for celebration. The arrival of the euro marks an important step forward for the Union. It does not mean our work is over but it certainly means that an enormous task has been successfully completed.  (Applause)
2305790 author: Nancy Reid:  Mr President, at the beginning of the British presidency, the British Prime Minister called for a Europe that works together as a team. Tony Blair said that the mission of the UK presidency was to make Europe work for the people .  As we approach the Cardiff summit and the end of the British presidency, we in the Socialist group firmly believe that the British Government has been true to its word. Jobs and employability have been given the attention they deserve. Agreement has been reached for the launch of a single currency on  1 st January next year. The process of enlargement has begun and the presidency has not flinched from ensuring that a firm start has been made on difficult issues like the reform of the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds. But I would hope that all the legislative procedures with regard to Agenda  2000  will be implemented by June  1999  and that this European Parliament is fully involved in all of the procedures. Mention should also be made of the progress towards a creation of a more effective Common foreign and security policy. I would like to congratulate Mr Cook in particular on his initiative with regard to a code of conduct on arms exports.  Progress has been made on these and indeed on many other areas but I would particularly like to refer to the fact that the British presidency really has had a very real physical presence in the European Parliament. For example, I have been doing a little homework and I have been very pleased to find that British ministers have appeared at every plenary session during the presidency. There have been sixteen appearances covering thirty separate debates; there have been forty eight presidency appearances before committee and by the end of the presidency over eighty British Government ministerial appearances will have taken place. That is a very good example and if anything marks a clear break with the previous government, it is that very material presence of this administration with the European Parliament.  As we approach the Cardiff summit, we must not only take stock of what has been achieved but perhaps more importantly we need to look to the future. We need a focus on the issues which will take us from Cardiff to Vienna and for the Socialist group top of the agenda has to be the issue of the economy and employment. We warmly welcome the fact that following the Luxembourg job summit employment plans have been submitted by national governments. The urgent task now, however, is to ensure that both plans are implemented as quickly and effectively as possible.  The plans, of course, will vary from one Member State to another but it is important for us all to recognize the need for common themes among our various approaches. For example, if Europe as a whole is to prosper in the global economy we have to compete effectively in that global economy. Competitiveness is not a takeitorleaveit option, on the contrary competitiveness is an essential prerequisite for sustainable economic success. At the same time, we need to recognize that there are a number of factors which determine whether or not we can compete effectively. Amongst these are the skills, adaptability and the motivation of our workforce, the extent to which we can develop an entrepreneurial and innovative culture and a degree to which we can invest in our economy for the future.  It is therefore essential that we all recognize the importance of research and development and of science generally. I would in this regard urge the Council to make available appropriate funds for the Fifth Framework Programme on research and technological development.  Finally, as the Member of the European Parliament representing Cardiff, I am immensely proud that the European summit is being held in the capital city of Wales. Today, Cardiff is emerging as a truly European city. It is a city proud of its traditions but also a city optimistically looking towards a future. Indeed, given that this summit will come at the end of a presidency which I am sure will be judged as a resounding success, there could hardly be a better host city than Cardiff.
4247276 author: Helen White:  Mr President, I find myself in sympathy with most of the objectives that have been expressed in the course of a very full debate in which all those taking part spoke with vigour and obvious commitment.  If I can straight away dispose of the one speech with which I did not agree. I could not find myself in agreement with what Mr Anthony said about refugee return in the former Yugoslavia. Let us not forget the basis on which those refugees were created. They were created by vile, violent and ethnicallybased confrontation. It is a very important as we construct a new Europe that we construct a new Europe on principle of ethnic pluralism and tolerance of minorities; that is after all one of the standards we apply to countries seeking to be members of the Union and it should also be a standard we apply to countries that seek to be in trade agreements with us.  I said earlier this afternoon how much we welcome President Nelson Mandela coming to Cardiff. We cannot celebrate the abolition of apartheid in Africa, only to tolerate it being created at home in a corner of Europe.  Otherwise, I find myself in much agreement with many of the objectives stated here. The one point that I did feel running through the discussion is that there was sometimes a failure to grasp that it was not enough to state the aspiration in order to deliver the outcome. I was particularly impressed at Mr Carnero Gonzlez listed as failures of the common foreign and security policy: Albania, Algeria, Kosovo, Western Sahara, the Middle East peace process.  There are immense problems in the world and there are some severe cases of conflict. I believe we are setting ourselves a totally impossible task which is bound to leave us all with a sense of frustration if we make the test of a common foreign and security policy whether it has resolved all conflicts within the world.  First of all, that is unattainable. Secondly, I would also counsel colleagues against a modern form of imperialism by thinking that the solutions that we ourselves decide are the right solutions in Europe are necessarily acceptable to those who are involved in conflict in other continents of the world. We have an obligation to offer our best offices to assist them in finding a solution and to take measures against those who willfully and irresponsibly prolong conflict or prolong violence. Within those two objectives of seeking to achieve a resolution of conflict and to deter people from the use of violence as a means of resolving conflict, we should ourselves find a common position among our countries. That will not always produce the solution but we certainly have an obligation to find that common position.  If you look back over the events of recent months, on a number of these conflict issues, Europe has indeed adopted a common position, has sought to seek to achieve solutions. It has not always succeeded and in those cases where we have success, like Bosnia, the process of clawing back from the bitter hatreds of recent years is inevitably going to take time if not a generation to complete. I would ask the Members of the European Parliament, whilst they are perfectly entitled to demand a common concern and common action from the Council, to recognize that will not necessarily produce outcomes and will certainly not produce outcomes that will be acceptable in the immediate short term.  Finally, can I pick up one or two colleagues who have referred to the mechanisms provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty to improve the common foreign and security policy. It is indeed the case that when we have the planning and early warning unit and when we have the High Representative in place, we will have a better mechanism for giving expression to the common positions we adopt. They will, of course, not have any legal basis until the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified. That is up to the Member States. Colleagues within the European Parliament can go back to Member States to make sure that they are achieving all possible speed in making sure that they do ratify. I am pleased to report to you that we have now almost completed the parliamentary processes in Britain for ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty. If other Parliaments achieve the same timescale, we can achieve ratification within the next few months and that will give a legal basis to these steps forward in common foreign and security policy. In the meantime, we have used our Presidency to take forward the preparation so that from the moment we have the legal basis to proceed we can proceed quickly with the changes in personnel, the arrangements, the provision for resources in place so that within the legal basis we can act immediately.  I end with one plea to all Members, I have listened with great interest to a number of speeches this afternoon demanding a common foreign and security policy and condemning the Council for lack of political will in achieving it. I am bound to say that in each of the countries from which I heard speakers speak eloquently and passionately this afternoon, I could recite lists of cases in the past five months when their Member State has held out against the others in achieving a common foreign and security policy; particularly in the case of Madam Lalumire who made the most rigorous demands for a common foreign and security policy.  Building such a common position is not easy, it requires compromise all round. We will never get a common foreign and security policy by one nation demanding that the rest of Europe adopt their common foreign and security policy. It will require tradeoffs between us and if we are going to achieve it our best prospect of achieving it is if we go into it openly recognizing that all countries are going to have to work for the common good and at times are going to have to abandon their own national positions in order to do so.  Sometimes, and my own country reserves that right, we will have to say no we cannot abandon this particular national perspective because it is too important. We have to retain that right to defend a national interest. That makes it difficult, of course, to oppose a common foreign and security policy but I would submit to Parliament that it is also an essential part of making sure that we get the popular agreement and the popular support for the legitimacy of the European Union.
3703972 author: Annette Reid:  Mr President, it is often said that one of the first signs of madness is to start talking to yourself. The attendance at this debate this evening shows how close to the edge some of us are in danger of becoming. My feeling is only somewhat lightened by the very warm welcome I give to the SecretaryGeneral who is here at the debate and Commissioner Liikanen.  I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Viola on an excellent report. It is excellent not only because it is good of itself but reflects what over recent years in the Committee on Budgets has become a seamless continuum of budgetary approach to our own Parliament. The stringency and the strict adherence to the  20   ceiling of Category  5  appropriations is something which Mr Viola has welcomed and has enforced very strictly in the resolution he puts to us tonight.  My group would certainly endorse the three principles which reflect that continuum to which I referred: trying to get our estimates more and more based on the principles of zerobased budgeting, taking strong account when fixing the budget of the implementation of the appropriations that have been placed in previous budgets and an insistence that demands for new appropriations should be backed by appropriate supporting documentation.  Behind those principles there is also a very clear statement of priorities from Mr Viola. One of those priorities is in relation to our property policy in Parliament, Although we have such a thin attendance, we should perhaps note that part of that property policy renders the tense of Mr Violas priorities in his explanatory memorandum slightly out of date. The necessary signatures were undertaken yesterday for us to proceed to the purchase of the Leopold building complex. That is extremely important as part of Parliaments approach to property policy. We have exercised the purchase option before the date of  31  May and in so doing we have managed to get the beneficial input to Parliaments budget of the BEF  7 . 25  billion that has been negotiated between Parliament and the Kingdom of Belgium.  That ECU  180 m that the Belgians are giving by way of indemnifying the land and land development costs is a very important part of our building policy. But added to Mr Violas report is Amendment No  2  from the Committee on Budgets, an amendment which I know Mr Viola supports. It is an amendment which refers to the supplementary and amending budget No  1  of  1998 . In that amendment we are seeking a letter of amendment from the Commission to supplementary and amending budget No  1  of  1998  so that we can continue with the policy of property acquisition. It is the view of the Bureau and of the Committee on Budgets  and here they are absolutely as one  that in that supplementary and amending budget we should seek to purchase the Belliard I and II buildings so that they can be made available to the Committee of the Regions, to the Economic and Social Committee and to the common structure which, following the Amsterdam Treaty, will be dissolved but which will still have to produce common services to those two committees. So, I strongly commend Amendment No  2 , which has already been carried by the Committee on Budgets, to the House.  The priorities are also stated as being the new staff management policy, a policy that the SecretaryGeneral has outlined very clearly both to Parliament and to the staff. A third priority which I particularly welcome is that which we attach to the problems related to the introduction of the euro and the impact of the millennium bug. I hope we can look to the administration to produce a report to Parliament as to what this priority means in practical terms, not necessarily waiting until next year. These are serious problems for an information technology department which is already in many ways overstretched and are probably two of the most important demands that will made of it.  Finally, I should like to refer to Amendment No  1  which stands in the name of my group. We have tabled this amendment in Mr Wynns name in order to leave the matter of staffing for the Ombudsman open until the first reading when one will have a clearer view of the overall need concerning staff. We have done that, taking into account the views of the Committee on Petitions rapporteur for the  1999  budget, Barbara Schmidbauer. I commend that amendment to the House as well.  On behalf of the Socialist members of the committee, I should like to say how much we identify with what Mr Viola has said about the sad death of VicePresident Lucas Pires. He was proving to be an extremely good interlocutor between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets. We will certainly miss him in that role but, above all else, we will miss him as a good parliamentarian.
6158469 author: Frederic Smith:  Mr President, I welcome todays debate on the Schroedter report on the Agenda  2000  chapter on economic and social cohesion as a solid basis on which to launch Parliaments more detailed and comprehensive work on the regulations governing the Structural Funds. As Mrs Schroedter said, there was a unanimous vote in the Committee on Regional Policy but I think she would also admit that was as a result of very substantial amendments tabled by many political groups, and, indeed, we have much more work to do in this area.  In response to Mr Colom i Naval, I would say that now is not the time to deal with the very detailed regulations in the Structural Funds: we will look at them when we draw up specific detailed reports.  This is a timely debate, following on from last weeks discussions under the British presidency in the Informal Council in Glasgow and the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, and in the light of todays very topical discussion at the Cardiff Summit on the progress report on Agenda  2000 , prepared by the British presidency to identify those areas where a consensus exists in the Council.  Therefore, in the light of these discussions, I wish to take some time to highlight a potential approach that my group will be taking during the reform process. There is no doubt that this reform of structural and Cohesion Funds represents the most significant changes in the last ten years with a view to meeting the challenges of enlargement and EMU. Enlargement will surely offer opportunities to our regions but we will want to ensure that the proposals presented by the Commission match our objectives and priorities as socialists, namely to continue the Delors legacy of promoting jobs, sustainable growth and the competitiveness of our regions and the central objective of economic and social cohesion of the Treaty to enable all citizens, regions and Member States to participate on an equal footing. The Unions benefits must be at the forefront of our policy process. This is just as much about creating equality of opportunity as removing the disparities between poorer and wealthier regions.  We should be clear about the internal challenges we face: one in five of Europes youth is out of work, unemployment among women is consistently higher than among men, longterm unemployment persists as a scourge of modern society.  The reform process must, therefore, combine fairness with affordability and durability, with more simplification and efficiency. It must be fair in order to ensure we give priority to our poor regions without abandoning those problem regions going through the process of economic and social restructuring in wealthier Member States. Solidarity, if it is to enjoy mass support, must be a twoway, and not a oneway process. Subsidiarity and decentralization must be the cornerstone of our future policies to ensure that our regional policies are relevant to the needs and interests of local communities.  I would, therefore, like to welcome the decision that Parliament should be fully associated with the reform process. We welcome the interinstitutional agreement and wish to see it signed and sealed under this presidency. We have had a positive letter from Robin Cook, the PresidentinOffice, but we need to move forward now on the more fundamental items.  Finally, I wish to raise some areas where we need to consider the Commissions proposals in more detail: efficiency, of course, is fundamental to ensure the better use of funds but if the efficiency reserve leads to more red tape and bureaucracy and an increased monitoring role for Commission staff, then I fear that all we will be doing is employing more private consultants in order to monitor those processes. So we need to look very carefully at how that reserve would work. I would be in favour of looking at an innovation reserve with the appropriate procedures of decentralization and subsidiarity.  We will be judged by our citizens on how we handle the challenge of reform. Only when the EU is seen to be contributing to the solution of major problems in society, such as poverty and unemployment, can we expect to enjoy their support and ensure the credibility of the Union and its policies and institutions.  My group will take this challenge seriously and we look forward to cooperating with the Council and the Commission in improving the Agenda  2000  proposals to gain support from the public. We sincerely hope we will be given the opportunity of sharing in the executive powers  in a spirit of codecision, I might add. In this way we can only add to the democratic legitimacy of the reform process.
7675863 author: Sebastian Bush:  Mr President, I warmly welcome the British Prime Minister to the European Parliament. I wish to thank him and his colleagues for a very effective and efficient EU presidency. I would like to place on record that at all times this Parliament and its Members were extended every courtesy and assistance at political and official level. I want to say how thankful the Members are for this. I wish to thank the Prime Minister for his contribution here this morning. I also wish to thank the President of the Commission for his contribution and to say that my group will strongly support the main thrust of what the Commission President said here today.  The Cardiff Summit has been more a stocktaking exercise than one in which major decisions have been made. Nevertheless, an ambitious timetable has been set for reaching major agreements on the reform of the common agricultural policy, the regional and social funds and the budget. They represent policy areas that are at the very heart of the European Union. The decisions will have a direct and immediate effect on the citizens of the Union, whether our farming and fishing communities, those in industry  large and small, rural and urban communities and those who live in the lessdeveloped regions and islands. These decisions must not become parttime hostages in the heat of election campaigns.  The Europe which we are building must favour an inclusive and caring society in which the interests of all must be respected. However, with  18  million people in the Union affected by unemployment including the young and the longterm unemployed, this objective is not being met. Tackling unemployment through a broad range of measures must remain our top social priority. Failure to do so will result in the retention of a twotier society of those who are included and those who are excluded. I regret that there has been no consideration of establishing a new programme to combat social exclusion and actions on behalf of the elderly. I appeal to the PresidentinOffice and to the incoming PresidentinOffice to reassure the House that whatever new initiatives are necessary will be undertaken.  The conclusions on unemployment which are outlined in part  3  of the presidencys document are more an overview of what is being done at present than a new set of initiatives. Only time will tell if they will be successful. If we are to go along with the presidencys conclusions then the fifteen employment action plans submitted by the Member States represent a real effort to enhance the employability of young people, the longterm unemployed and women. It means that demands that we have been making for the development of skills, lifelong learning, improving conditions for SMEs and the selfemployed are being put into effect. This is very much indeed to be welcomed. What we now need to see is the practical and rapid implementation of these action plans. A series of orientations for future work and employment are set out in the conclusions. Regrettably the detail is vague, for example with regard to childcare schemes.  We attach considerable importance to the successful introduction of the euro. It is essential that the remaining legislative and practical steps be completed rapidly. The negotiations which have begun on Agenda  2000  are among the most important ever to be undertaken by the Union. Choices will have to be made about key policies which will have major longterm consequences for each of our countries. Agenda  2000  is indeed of fundamental importance for the future development of the Union. It not only has consequences for present Member States but also for the whole process of enlargement. Under no circumstances can the cohesion process for existing lessdeveloped regions be jeopardized, nor should there be any link between EMU participation and eligibility under the Cohesion Fund. The whole question of transition arrangements is of the greatest importance. They must, for example, in the case of my country, be adequate in terms of the level and duration of funding in order to address our continuing significant development needs.  The reform of the common agricultural policy is very controversial. Agriculture is one of our greatest assets. Agenda  2000  must strengthen and not destroy the common agricultural policy. It is crucial to the preservation of our family farms and rural life. I do not believe that the present proposals constitute a reasonable basis for negotiation.  Mr President, I would like to personally congratulate you on your own efforts and those of my Prime Minister Bertie Ahern with regard to the Northern Ireland peace agreement of  10  April. I also wish to acknowledge and sincerely thank Members of this House for their support for the peace process. My group warmly appreciates the further endorsement by the European Council of this historic agreement and its renewed commitment that the Union should continue to play an active part in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. We particularly welcome the Councils invitation to the Commission to make proposals as to how new and creative ways can be found to support the fresh opportunities which the peace agreement will bring.  Finally, it is my view that it is regrettable that the European Commission has again come under attack in the context of the European Summit. The Commission has always undertaken the duties and responsibilities it has been given in an evenhanded and fair manner. The Commission has consistently discharged its functions as guarantor of the European Treaties in an exemplary fashion. President Santer and his team of Commissioners have consistently reported on their activities to this Parliament and have not in my view exceeded the powers which have been given to them by the Council and I hope that the Commission will not be made a scapegoat in national election campaigns in our Member States.
1660453 author: Marc Reid:  Mr President, these are major occasions in the life of our Parliament and we should not overlook the fact that President Santer is here as well as the PresidentinOffice and I welcome them both. I would like to thank the Commission President for his very skilful and diplomatic address. However, we are mainly here to talk about the UK presidency.  We have to recognize that it started with a great deal of goodwill. The change of government was welcomed right across Europe, not least in Scotland where the Conservatives suffered total wipeout at the general election. But I would say to the PresidentinOffice that he should not mistake the sighs of relief for gasps of admiration. The greatest asset the Labour Government has is that it is not the old Conservative Government.  In saying this, I do not want to be grudging. We welcome the change of tone. This Parliament appreciates the fact that we have had Ministers such as Robin Cook, Clare Short and many others addressing Parliament and attending its committee meetings. That is very worthwhile. We all remember that handbag that Mrs Thatcher wielded when she banged the table and said:  I want my money back . Well, the handbag has gone but the rebate and the claim for rebate remain from the UK, and from Germany.  In trying to appraise the record of the UK presidency we have to match the rhetoric and the achievement and ask ourselves what we will remember the UK presidency for. It departed, with perhaps unfortunate symbolism, from Waterloo Station six months ago. There were two big events in the last six months. The first was on  2  and  3  May when we assembled to welcome the launch of the single currency on behalf of  11  Member States. It was supremely ironic that the British Finance Minister, Gordon Brown, who presided over that in Brussels could not be the team manager but had to play in the left outside position because he was not part of it.  We have waited in vain today for an indication of commitment to the cause of the single currency, which I and most of us think is the most important aspect of European integration. A colleague, Mr Puerta, also mentioned the tooclose association with the United States. On the Iraq crisis the hotline to the White House was operative long before there was any thought of calls to the Elyse Palace or anywhere else. This Clintonization of policy is regrettable, and I have to mention the disgrace of the secret importation of nuclear waste from Georgia to Scotland. The citizens of Europe were not even informed until it had arrived.  There were also some nondecisions. What happened to quotahopping which was supposed to be sorted out in the British presidency? What about the compensation for the farmers who are desperate at the strength of the pound and are looking for compensation?  But let us look ahead to the vision of Europe. That is what Prime Minister Blair talks about, and all of us are concerned about it. What do we make of the phrase a Europe of nation states ? Was this a major faux pas ? By that I mean a John Major faux pas . When John Major talked about the nation states and subsidiarity, he meant that it stopped at Dover. Nothing that applied below that level was in his mind. It would be unfair for us to accuse Prime Minister Blair of that. He has recognized the historic nations of the United Kingdom. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all to have their own parliamentary democracy. That is a transformation which parallels those of Gorbachev in his day.  I finish by drawing on an analogy with the World Cup which is on all our television screens. The Scottish football fans have got it about right. They have been welcomed across Europe for their positive contribution. These are the same fans that voted for Home Rule for Scotland in the referendum last year. That was welcomed at the time. Their behaviour is welcome now. I would urge Prime Minister Blair to turn his back firmly on the equivalent of Les Hooligans  the Fleet Street tabloids with their constant Brussels bashing  and take a leaf out of the book of the Tartan Army whose vision, like mine, is to participate, to be there and to create a true Europe of the peoples.
7501302 author: Lynne LaCourt:  Mr President, in Mr Christodoulous report  in the explanatory statement  there is a wonderful line that says this provides a longterm solution, since it has not been unilaterally denounced by any of the three institutions concerned  yet. Yet is my word, because Parliament has not yet voted on this report.  I am going to speak with two tongues in this debate: one  as an individual who has been involved in the debate in the negotiations, and then, as it is my responsibility to speak, in my role as coordinator for the Socialist Group.  On a personal level I welcome the report. I think it is the best that we could achieve, and a culmination of many years of work and attempts by Parliament to get this problem resolved. So, knowing what we have gone through in the past, I am extremely pleased with what we have got for the future.  I also have to say that when we were coming to this conclusion on  17  July, there was cooperation between ourselves, the Commission and, dare I say, the majority of the Council. The previous presidency had given its commitment to resolving the matter.  As the British Prime Minister said from where the PresidentinOffice now sits, the Austrian Presidency has been committed to it, but I have to say that the length of time taken, which the chairman, Mr Samland, referred to, was because of indecision by at least one Nordic Member State. Quite frankly, it was a pathetic performance on that trialogue to get a conclusion to this decision, which really involved a small amount of money. I hope I never have to go through that again because it was a waste of time if nothing else. That is my personal view.  When we were coming to these conclusions, all three institutions were of a mind that the deal on the legal basis would be fine for the future, but we still have the problem of this year  1998 . That is why I advised caution at the beginning of my remarks. I, and Mr Samland, Mr Colom i Naval, Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop and Mr Tomlinson  those who were involved in the negotiations  have to convince our group tonight, when we discuss the issue, that this report is worthy of a yes vote.  We need some clarification, certainly from the Commission, on those lines which were considered to be problematic. There were four areas. Last night I received a document chart showing the lines where the problems were, and hopefully the Commission has come forward with solutions.  This will be taken to our group tonight and we will do our best to convince. But I seek the help of the Commission now to clarify those areas of doubt which will arise when Members see this, especially over lines B 5321   action for the economic and social areas like cooperative mutuals, etc,  where a large proportion of the money has not yet been utilised and there does not seem to be a way of utilising it.  On lines B 7611 ,  851  and  852 , where sums in the region of ECU  11 . 5  million remain unused, what will happen to those amounts of money?  In the areas which we did have problems with such as sport and minority languages, the bulk of the money has been used. There will be small amounts left and it is fair to say that even without the problems we have had we could still have had those small amounts of money left. I am therefore quite prepared to argue the case for them. But there are those few lines which still give us concern, and I would seek help from the Commission to give us an assurance that those areas will not be left untouched  that the money will be utilised. With that information I hope we can go forward to our group tonight and then vote positively.  One final point  we went to a lot of trouble to get this report put together and there was consensus on its content. There are some amendments put forward  three or four by the Greens  which, while nice, are not necessary. My recommendation to our group would be that we do not support the amendments but we stick by the report unamended. I do not want anyone to assume that we do not sympathise with the contents of those amendments by the Greens, but we really want the report to be concise rather than elaborate.
7254133 author: Roger LaCourt:  Madam President, it is customary on these occasions to congratulate the rapporteur on his work. What is perhaps less customary is the fact that I actually mean it when I congratulate the rapporteur on his work. This is a good, thoughtful and thorough report. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur on the way he went about producing his report and the cooperation he showed with others in the committee. The report has taken on board many of the observations we made in discussion in committee. That has meant that we have managed to keep amendments to the minimum and thereby kept the cohesion of this report. I think that is important. I should like to thank him for that.  This report emphasises the importance of Hong Kong to the European Union and indeed to the global economic system, as we have seen in the last few weeks. But our main message has got to be, quite frankly, that we have to recognise that the handover of power has gone very well. The worst fears of many people, expressed in this Chamber, have not been realised. The idea of one country, two systems appears to work. There has been political, press and religious freedom. There has not been widespread corruption as was feared. Indeed the high quality of the Hong Kong civil service continues to shine through. Of course there are areas of concern and Mr Cushnahan has outlined some of them.  There have been questions about political influence being used for appointments to statutory advisory bodies such as the housing authority. That is an area that needs to be watched. There were rumours that Chinese security advisors were to be installed in the Chief Executives office. I am glad to see that was denied by the government. There was the attack on Radio Television Hong Kong by a member of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference. While the Chief Executive, Tung Cheehwa was somewhat dubious in his response, President Jiang Zemin was very clear in condemning any influence in Hong Kong affairs. I am very glad to see also that the new guidelines that will be introduced for Radio Television Hong Kong will be based on those applying to the BBC and other international broadcasters, thus helping guarantee its neutrality.  Our main concern was always about the existence of the provisional legislature. We must recognise the positive step forward reflected by the elections to the Legislative Council. We should celebrate the high turnout in those elections and the fair way in which they were conducted, although we should still register our concern at the severe reduction of the franchise in the functional constituencies and the possibilities for abuse of corporate voting in the functional constituencies through the registration of shell companies. We therefore look forward to full democracy in Hong Kong as soon as possible.  There have been concerns about some of the decisions taken in the Hong Kong courts, which Mr Cushnahan describes in detail in his report. One particular issue is the question of the immunity of state bodies from prosecution and whether this applies to the New China News Agency. That worry has been accentuated by the case of Emily Lau, who has been involved in dispute for nearly  12  months with the New China News Agency.  The precise status of the New China News Agency should be clarified as a matter of priority. The rule of law, as Mr Cushnahan has said, is crucial to the future of Hong Kong. One further area which will need to be watched carefully is the need for the new Legislative Council to pass legislation on issues such as subversion and treason under Article  23  of the Basic Law. How Hong Kong handles that will be a key to the continuing success of one country, two systems.  The best sign of the success of one country, two systems has been that Hong Kong has been able, so far, to weather the Asian crisis, and to do so without interference from China, but with support from China. I would be interested to hear Commissioner Brittans observations on that aspect. Clearly Hong Kong has to have autonomy in its own economic affairs but it also has to have the support of China.  Finally, I would endorse Mr Cushnahans remarks about granting visafree access to residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. I believe this would be an important step forward in developing greater commercial ties between the European Union and Hong Kong.  In conclusion, I would say so far so good; in fact, better than we had hoped for. Let us hope that we can continue to work closely with the authorities of Hong Kong to develop a better future for the residents of Hong Kong and to develop Hong Kongs important status as a keystone in the Asian economy.
4727542 author: Roger Corless:  Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I wish to express our very strong support for this current programme of measures to combat unemployment in Europes areas of industrial decline. Support, because job creation and an end to the scourge of unemployment must be the first priority of our Structural Fund programmes; support, because people living in our coalmining, textile, steel and defence regions did not ask for the economic shock waves that have taken the heart out of their communities and no one can ask them to rebuild their economies without public support; and support, because this ECU  9 bn of expenditure  more than  7 m  represents the peoples priorities on how European money should be spent.  In congratulating Mr Vallv on his report, I note there are many areas of agreement with my own parallel report on guidelines for Objective  1  and  5 b areas over the same period. We agree on the need to ensure stricter adherence to equal opportunities and environmental objectives in all of the programmes. Five per cent for the environment: that means that  95   of the money could be harming our natural resources, and that is not good enough.  We agree on the need to support the guidelines process to ensure common themes underlie the programmes in each of our countries, and the need for a full consultation on those guidelines by the European Commission. I hope the Commissioner will take the opportunity this morning to guarantee to us that the new sets of guidelines will be ready by  31  December.  We agree that the delayed agreement of the programmes in the first period   12   of the money being carried over  causes unacceptable damage in the regions and localities which wait too long and then are forced to spend too quickly.  On behalf of my own country, we appreciate that the United Kingdom is the biggest beneficiary of this programme: some ECU  2 . 7 bn  over  2 bn. More than  150   000  small and mediumsized companies in Britain are being helped today thanks to that money. With some  14   of all public investment in metropolitan France represented in this programme, it demonstrates, beyond doubt, the value of the safety net, which we argued for in the next programming period, to avoid a sudden disappearance of this very significant level of support. I thank the Commission for accepting what we had to say.  The Socialists will support the vast majority of amendments before the House today. In particular, we support the conclusions of our colleagues from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that more money must be allocated to new sources of employment, including the cooperative sector, environmental projects and local development initiatives. We agree with them that the complete lack of evaluation of the number of disabled beneficiaries is a marked failure to achieve the mainstreaming, which the Commission so often talks about.  Let me explain where we must disagree. Firstly, we cannot support specific amendments which single out maritime fisheries or urban areas for special priority, whatever our personal sympathies, because this represents a balanced package in which no one special interest can be advocated above any other. Secondly, we cannot support proposals for the split in funding or criteria in relation to the new Structural Fund regulation. That debate is being held in committee, and it would be premature to resolve those issues today. Thirdly, we will not single out the Commission for specific criticism over underspending or for its failure to address the horizontal objectives sufficiently.  We share the concerns, but we prefer to work together with the Commissioner to constructively tackle the causes of these problems in the future.  Finally, in our resolution of  14  February  1996  we stated our demands for this programme to the Commissioner. I am delighted that those were largely agreed.  14  February is Valentines Day  a day for sharing messages between lovers. With the greatest respect to Mrs WulfMathies, even if we cannot guarantee such a close relationship today between Parliament and the Commission, we thank her and congratulate her on the very important work being achieved in this programme.
407683 author: Claire Merx:  Mr President, I shall be speaking in general terms about my groups position. Several later speakers will go into more detail. I would begin in the usual way by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop, Mr Viola and certainly Mr Giansily as well. His report has been supported by our group with the small amendments which occurred in committee. In the light of the PresidentinOffices remarks that we are not quite as much in tune with things as the Council, I have to say that in July the Council made known its decisions: one of the problems in July was that we did not have a dialogue on the PDB because all the time in conciliation was spent on the legal base. So it is a great pity that we did not have the discussions we should have had. By the same token, we have not had the ad hoc procedure which we should have had. This is a breakdown in communications between our two institutions and it needs to be rectified next year.  Having said that, I thank the PresidentinOffice for the work he has done on the legal base. It was appreciated. It has helped to establish next years budget, certainly in Categories  3  and  4 . We consider it to be a prudent budget; we consider it to be a reasonable budget. We have tried to make reductions where we think they are necessary. The problem for the Council is the strategic reserve, the bridging budget that Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop has spoken about. We are going to leave no margin. As you know it is our insurance policy, as the Commission has said. It is our guarantee because if we do not get an interinstitutional agreement we have to have a fallback position.  Let us be clear: Agenda  2000  depends on the financial perspective. The financial perspective depends on an interinstitutional agreement. From our side of the House we want to see an interinstitutional agreement but if we cannot come to a conclusion on that then, make no mistake, we will go back to Article  203 . But to have Article  203  we need the finances for future years. As the Commissioner said, if we adopt that strategy the Commission will have to call on own resources from the Member States earlier in the year. There is a way round that which the Council should be discussing. That was mentioned by Mr Samland in one of our discussions: namely, we need to get an agreement between our institutions before the end of the year which says that if there is no interinstitutional agreement, the basis for Article  203  in the future will be the maximum amount of spend for the year  1999 . If the Council could take that on board it might solve some of the problems which Member States have. I know they have these problems because they keep contacting us on this side of the House. We now have more socialist governments than ever and they keep contacting us to say it is not a good idea. We have to explain the strategy to them time and time again.  I turn now to the different areas. Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop has covered Categories  1  and  2 . I would like to add the part that the peace programme funded by the European Union has played in Northern Ireland. Parliament and the Council  and the Union in general  have something to be quite proud of with the role that money has played. John Hume was instrumental in making sure that each year we had a case to make for that. Let us add our congratulations to those the PresidentinOffice extended to John Hume.  On Category  3 , one of the reasons why things have been so easy is because the legal base solved a lot of our problems. The recommendations made by the rapporteur on the pilot programmes and on the preparatory actions have taken a lot out of the debate. We have not been arguing over small lines. I was quite surprised how easily we came to a conclusion on those amounts of money for the pilot programmes etc. The vast majority of actions on the lines that have disappeared have been placed elsewhere on other lines. So, all in all, between the Commission, Council and the rapporteur, a decent job has been done in getting over the problem of the legal base. Hopefully that has now been solved and we can move on in the future to have a better basis for the budget.  On the Fifth Framework Programme we are still looking for a solution. While the Committee on Budgets voted the PDB, it may at the end of the day be far too big. If we get an agreement in which it is less than the PDB  and if we are realistic, it probably will be  if, in second reading, we then reduce that figure we may have a gap and that affects our strategy for the bridging budget. One thing that crosses my mind  and it has not been discussed in our group  is that we may have to frontload the Fifth Framework Programme in the  1999  budget to make sure that the margin is kept to an absolute minimum.  Concerning Category  4 , I should first like to mention Turkey. The vote in committee was straightforward. It is a token entry on the line and ECU  50 m in reserve. But there is no legal base for that line. Whilst we voted for that in the committee because we consider it to be a political statement rather than a common sense action to vote out the line, we went along with it. Since then our group has discussed the matter and our approach would be not to support that line; not to support the ECU  50 m in reserve even, because there is no legal base. Our problem is how to do it because there are no amendments to scrap the line. If we can get a split vote, that is what we on this side of the House will do when it comes to the line on Turkey.  On ECHO, in committee we voted against the money going in reserve and we stand by that position. Regardless of the statements made elsewhere about the pressure being put on the Commission, we have to say the work done by Mr Liikanen and Mrs Gradin in trying to get this problem solved has actually gone unnoticed in many areas. We want to pay tribute to the work they have done. We thought it was wrong to put the money for humanitarian aid in reserve under threat for next year  we were penalising the people who needed those resources. I could understand it if we were going to put the expenses of the Commissioners involved  or even the salaries of the people involved  in reserve, but we did not. My group and I consider that putting actual humanitarian aid in reserve is the wrong thing to do. We will therefore be voting against that amendment and if we vote against it, it will not get  314  votes and consequently the money will go back on the line.  Also in category  4  there are two items which Mr Cunningham mentioned, and others will mention, which have given cause for concern: one is tropical forests and the other is the line on antipersonnel mines. I should like to explain why we voted the way we did. On tropical forests it has been ECU  50  million for the last two, if not three, years. Each year the Notenboom procedure takes money which is unspent from that line. This year the Notenboom procedure will be taking ECU  11  million from the tropical forest line. That is why our group has voted for the ECU  40  million.  A similar thing has happened with the antipersonnel mines. We went along with the reduction proposed by the rapporteur because there are many other lines which have the facility for demining those areas which cause a danger to personnel in those areas. We have agreed with the rapporteur in the resolution that we should get some concrete statements from the Commission on both these areas. What is the situation with tropical forests? Does it need ECU  50  million or does it need ECU  40  million? On the antipersonnel mines, do we really need a plethora of lines for this action or can it be concentrated in one area? The Commission would help tremendously if we could get some clarification on that.  Still in category  4 , we have a problem with bananas. We have always had a problem with bananas. The Treaty of Rome was held up for  24  hours before it was signed because of bananas. The final GATT round was not concluded until the EU had finalised its agreement on bananas. We have problems even in our group about this. The reality is that the majority of our group will be voting against the amendment which will put the money on the line. This is an area where there is a lot of confusion and once again the Commission could help if they could clarify the difference between the spends in category  4  on this and the spends in the EDF and why it has to be done in one and not the other.  On Mr Violas report, most things can go through smoothly. The one thing that will not go through smoothly on Thursday is the Members allowances and the Statute. Our group was split on the vote last night and I am sure our group will be split on the vote on Thursday. I will state now that the Socialist Group does not have a definitive position. Whilst we discussed and voted on it last week, I am sure that position will change come Thursday. I am sure you will see hands going up in several directions on the various votes that appear next week.  Finally, Mr President, the Court of Justice. We voted against an increase in personnel there because we are being consistent. All the political groups have had a policy of no increases in personnel in all the institutions, and that should also apply to the Court of Justice.
4492018 author: Claire MacLeod:  Mr President, this budget debate is the last one of this particular House before the elections next year and, indeed, when we come back to discuss the year  2000 , we should have an institutional agreement and a financial perspective which will be different from those we have today.  Before coming to my remarks on institutional budgets and the Commission budget, there are two general remarks I wish to make about the  1999  budget as a whole. Firstly, I believe it is a sign of Parliaments sense of responsibility that it has left large margins untouched in the budget. It is true that the overall strategy will be earmarking some of the funds in the margin in the reserve but we have made it very clear from our Groups point of view that these are not funds which will be committed  they are for strengthening Parliaments negotiating position for the financial perspective and the interinstitutional agreement.  We have a budget which is very stringent: it has shown how, over a sevenyear period, the figures that one is now voting on are very different from the financial perspective which we negotiated back in  1992 . But these are unexpected developments: the CAP is well under the guidelines, as the rapporteur for the Commission budget has said, and much of the structural funds has remained unspent and uncommitted and handed back to taxpayers.  My second remark on the budget as a whole is that there is a real danger that we are moving into a period where the annual budget has no relevance whatsoever; where we have multiannual programmes which have decided the figures year by year, and a financial perspective which has allocated funds well into the future. This is why when it comes to the negotiations on the future financial perspective, we want to make it absolutely clear that there will be sufficient flexibility, both in terms of the allocation of funds and in the structure of a financial perspective. Otherwise we would be better going back into  203  and into the annual budget process where Parliament can have its real relevance. But we must ensure that the annual budget is a place where we can discuss the figures rather than the present state of affairs. I have had the feeling we have been talking about small amounts rather than some of the bigger issues which we are concerned with in the European Union. Above all, we must avoid what I would call a kind of Sovietstyle rigidity in the way in which we set our budgets in the European Union in the  21 st century.  Let me move now to comments on other institutions. I wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Viola. It is not an easy task to be rapporteur on the budget when there are really sensitive issues around that the House has to decide on. But we in the EPP Group have not taken the line that we have to be absolutely rigid: where there is a justifiable case for extra staff, as the Court of Justice convinced us, then we have voted for those credits for  10  LA staff. We also want to make sure that next year, when Parliament comes back after the European elections, that we can have a properly organised system for information technology, which is why we will be voting to clear all the credits out of reserve on information technology.  The most sensitive issue is quite clearly travel expenses, where we, as a group, have held together so far  and I expect that this will be the position on Thursday  for the overall Committee on Budgets compromise which links the question of travel costs taken at actual cost for Members allowances to the overall question of the Statute. The vast majority of us believe that the most sensible thing is to come to an overall agreement on this, linked to our signature on the interinstitutional agreement at the end of March next year, so that then we can have a really strong and satisfactory means by which Members know what their rights and duties are and we will then know how we will be paying for our travel costs for the next Parliament. Because it is illusionary to think that simply having a transitional decision  which the Bureau decided last night  is something we can live with for a future Parliament and settle all our problems. We would like the Statute to be resolved and decided as soon as it can be on the basis of the Rothley report.  I move to the Commission budget. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop, on behalf of my Group. I know only too well it is not easy either to navigate that kind of thing through the House.  There are three points here which stand out from our particular perspective. Firstly, there are still some minor points which we wish to see instated, which have not been instated by the Committee on Budgets, relating to such issues as information outlets  I can assure Ms Morgan we will be voting in favour of that on Thursday (B 30301 ) , on Alzheimers, tourism, and tropical forests: these are issues which we want to see part of the budget that is adopted. Because we know that the provisions on the legal basis have not eased our decisions this year in terms of how to decide on what are pilot projects and what are preparatory actions. Presumably this will get easier now as we move into a different process. It is always the first year which is the most difficult.  Secondly, on the external budget, last night in the Committee on Budgets we voted on a proposal by my Group for Russia. We want to ensure that credits have been set aside so that we can respond to the request for humanitarian aid which Mr Primakov has made to the European Union institutions. We do not know what it is going to be, but these credits should be set aside for the budgetary authority to be able to take specific action, should the need arise. That is the purpose of that amendment.  Lastly, I come to ECHO. This is a question which has caused some real concern, but this arose because we in the EPP Group decided that it was intolerable that we, as parliamentarians, should have to go to look for a particular report in the Commission offices and that we could not actually view that particular document as parliamentarians on Parliaments premises. So that was the major condition which we attached to unblocking the funds on humanitarian aid. Whether wilfully or not, this has been blown out of some proportion by many in this House because they did not vote in favour of it. It always said in the amendment that this was up to the second reading. It was a tactical reserve. Now Mr Santer  and I thank the President of the Commission very much for the letter he has sent  has fulfilled those two conditions, and tonight I will propose to my Group that we release the reserve on this line for the vote on Thursday. In my view, this has been a significant victory for Parliament in terms of making the Commission more open and accountable. This is the only way we can really make our citizens confident in the financial process in the future.
3181277 author: Jennifer Bush:  Mr President, we are entering the last year of this budget cycle. In budgetary terms it can be said that Parliament has made much progress, together with the Commission and the Council. We have now established ourselves as a credible institution. This year the payments on the budget will be about the same as the overall growth of the national budgets. As far as the legal base agreement is concerned, we have now done precisely what we promised.  Unfortunately the same cannot yet be said of the Council. I appreciate the work of this presidency, as I have always appreciated every presidency, but there is a structural problem in the Council. The structural problem is that the General Affairs Council, as the presidency itself recognises, is no longer a Council of arbitration. Ministers of Foreign Affairs have lost overall control of general policies in the Community. That means that the Budget Council, in this particular case, remains the accounting body it has always been. An example has been given by Mrs Dhrkop Dhrkop, our very creative rapporteur for this year: Leonardo. We have seen similar instances in the separate positions on agriculture. That problem still needs to be tackled. I hope that the presidency will have more success at second reading that at first reading. It is a structural problem and unless we achieve progress there I do not believe that the budget can, in the future, be the kind of policy instrument which really sets the right priorities.  The first priority, as set out by Mrs Dhrkop Drhkop in her general approach is that we must prepare ourselves for the period  20002006 , hopefully with financial perspectives and a fully fledged interinstitutional agreement. But in order to achieve that Parliament has to prepare itself. We have therefore followed the overall strategy which means setting an overall reserve  not for use in financial terms, but for use as a base for the coming period.It is against that background that I also supported the amendment  not because we want to simply increase the amount of money but because we want to send a particular signal. If that means that we have finally to reduce the amount to fit into the overall strategy, I hope that can be done.  I have just one other point on external affairs, regarding Turkey. Our colleague, Mr Wynn, made the point that it is very clear that the Council again has not been very consistent on Turkey. Turkey should be part of an overall structure for the European Union. It is the financial cooperation which still does not have a legal base. We will put forward an amendment for the budget resolution to make it clear that we expect the Council to come forward with that. If there is one Member State blocking it, I hope the Council can finally come to an arrangement on that.  A budget must reflect priorities. It is against that background that we were very happy indeed that on one of the key issues of our time  asylum and refugees  Parliament has taken an initiative which is supported by all groups in this House. It is supported because we believe that setting up a European refugee fund can mark the beginning of a policy of solidarity. I make a special appeal to the presidency. Some of the points of the presidencys paper on Geneva have perhaps been misunderstood. But it is important to realise that solidarity must begin with financial solidarity. If we want to have a policy of overall burdensharing, the European Community must have an instrument in its hand. That was the background to the discussions of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. Some of us in the House took the initiative of really trying to develop the pilot projects. I hope that the Council will, next year, create a legal base. That legal base will then be the basis of an asylum and refugee policy which can finally be in the first pillar and be a real policy of the European Union.  On the issue of ECHO, I only want to repeat what others have said before. It is important that we have a real approach of substance. We appreciate very much the work of Commissioners Liikanen and Gradin. But there is still a problem in the Commission as a whole. It is against that background that the issue of ECHO must be taken up. As a group we are against putting UCLAF into a separate box. I think the Commissioner knows this. But we want to give a signal. The signal received from President Santer is a signal which we very much appreciate. We will also vote for unblocking it in the reserve and putting it on the line. It is not a question of playing with humanitarian issues. It is simply that in the first reading it is important to give a concrete signal.  Regarding travel allowances, I am getting sick and tired of this whole issue, as are many of us. But our group has taken a very specific position  which is shared by many, but not all  namely, no other organisation tolerates travel costs higher than the real costs. It is against that background that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has been pleading for a long time for real costs. Of course we realise that a statute must be forthcoming but that statute is the prime responsibility of the Council. We can do no better at this stage than take a concrete position which will finally be a position of courage and give a signal that this House is in order.
4607959 author: Amy Corless:  Mr President, it is with great pleasure that on behalf of my group I welcome to Parliament the first Chancellor of Austria to hold the presidency of the European Council. I thank him very much for being here to take part in our annual debate on the state of the Union and listen to our views about the future of Europe.  It is, in my view, a sign of the times that our heads of state and government are meeting in informal session to discuss the direction in which Europe is travelling. It is a sign of confidence  indeed of the growing confidence and maturity of our Union  that the meeting this coming weekend will focus on giving European citizens a sense of ownership of this Union, to make them feel that the partnership in which we are engaged is of value to them. And of course it is.  We have spoken many times, but over the last year in particular, about the need to give Europe back to its people, to create a peoples Europe. Fine words, but just what do they mean? I believe that a peoples Europe is about peace, prosperity and security. If Prtschach can breathe new life into the vision of a united Europe by pointing the way forward on these three concepts  peace, prosperity and security  then it will be setting a new and relevant agenda for the coming years.  This weekend we can continue the very excellent start that was made in Amsterdam last year. Amsterdam gave some signals of just what a peoples Europe might be about, what it might look like, because we agreed a job creation role for the Union, endorsed the social dimension, created a broad antidiscrimination competence, strengthened environmental, consumer and health opportunities and insisted on stronger cooperation between enforcement officers on terrorism and drugs. These are the issues that affect peoples lives. These are the issues we pursued in Amsterdam. Now, in an increasingly unstable world, economically and politically, it is time to build on the strengths of Europe; to look at those areas where people increasingly expect us to be active and creative. For instance, the need, as has been much mentioned here already, for a dynamic common foreign and security policy, has never been so evident. The European Unions  15  economies, on the verge of the most exciting and innovative monetary venture of modern times  the launch of the euro  are calling out for greater economic coordination to manage global economic turbulence and to stimulate internal growth.  Europe is not an end in itself. Europe is a tool to deal with the problems which confront us across the continent and globally. In that sense as well the moment is right. Over recent weeks and months we have seen a desperate need for political leadership in the world. With economic turbulence continuing from the Far East to Russia, with increasing pressure on Latin American economies and currencies we have witnessed a paucity of political leadership. Japanese politics has been reeling from crisis to crisis. President Yeltsin has struggled to keep a government  any government  in the Kremlin and we have all been compelled to watch the personal and institutional trauma of the American presidency. It is Europe which is promoting innovation in the global economic and monetary structures. It is the euro which is creating a significantly new element in Europes favour in that economic turbulence. And it is European leaders who are articulating the need for new globalised, appropriate regulation and reformed global structures to give shape, coherence and rationality in the global market.  But this is also a moment when confidence worldwide is at a low ebb and when many are confused about where and in which direction the global market is taking them. It is a moment when we have the opportunity to demonstrate that we in Europe can provide leadership in an unstable world. The questions which are crying out to be answered are the same throughout the Member States and the same issues that are demanding answers in the European discussions as well: how to create jobs in a global market; how to reform the social welfare systems of Europe without denying help and support to those who truly need it; how to save the environment for the future; how to deal with the scourges of racism, drugs and terrorism; how to train and retrain individuals to cope with the challenge of information technology; in essence, how to create a dynamic, prosperous economy with social justice.  I believe in a strong European Union. I believe that Europes institutions need to be effective and efficient. We must continue to change, refine and democratise our institutions if we want to establish within the body politic and amongst the Unions officials a culture of openness and a willingness to conform to the challenges of modern democracy. But amongst the people in our Member States, the institutional debate is long past its sellby date. It is and remains important to us, as it should be. We operate within the institutions. We are bound by their rules of engagement and we are often trapped by a culture of political administrative involvement which is dated and often found wanting.  So inevitably and quite rightly we will pursue changes. That is common to all parliaments, particularly to new ones, such as we are. But it is time that we made clear that Europe must not be about building institutions. It must be about securing a wider, more stable, peaceful European continent for us all; not building institutions  building a Community of shared values; not building institutions  building a future for our young.  We are often teased and criticised that we have no big idea. Europe is a big idea whose genesis and motivation is no less powerful today than it was at its inception. As John Hume said yesterday in his moving statement to this House, Europe is the greatest model of conflict resolution this world has ever seen. But today the Union has even greater vocation. Those who give more than a cursory glance at the global environment in which we are working cannot fail to see the significance of the European Union: its ability to act together for its  370  million citizens; the potential power of its economy with a single currency; its opportunity to offer a coherent chance to its young through coordinated action for employment for the future; its traditions of tolerance and openness and its sophisticated social model. If all of this can be harnessed with a greater and expanded model of cooperation in foreign and security affairs so that the Bosnias and Kosovos of this world can be prevented  not just stopped once they have begun, but prevented  then we are truly offering something new for the future.
3998212 author: Jennifer Whittacker:  Mr President, ours is a Union that has shown itself capable of extraordinary achievement when it combines vision with political will. Sadly, it is also capable of causing grave disappointment when such qualities are absent. Vision and political will have brought us to the threshold of launching the euro in  71  days time. Internally and externally our economic relations are set to reach a new plane. As a zone dedicated to stability we can exert a major positive influence on the global stage especially at this time of crisis.  My group believes that to do this the presidency must develop proposals to ensure that the European Central Bank, together with the Euro  11  Council, assisted by the Commission and accountable to this Parliament, fully develops the external representation of the euro. Having worked so hard to create this powerful federal monetary capacity, we must not dissipate its international effect by an absence of vision and will. In seeking to enhance the international role of the Central Bank my group also expects from the bank itself greater transparency in its policy formulation. Without that we fear tensions could arise between the political and the monetary authorities, especially if the pace of economic progress slows down. The ELDR also strongly urges those Member States which meet the criteria, namely Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom, to join the euro.  There are few areas where our policy pretensions and our actual effort stand in starker contrast than in the area of common foreign and security policy. Once again the Kosovo crisis exposes the gap between aspiration and outcome. Kosovo, despite recent progress, remains dangerously poised on the edge of a humanitarian disaster. Its ceasefire is fragile, its political prospects uncertain. The ELDR believes that the Union and the international community must maintain pressure on Mr Milosevic and must be prepared, if necessary, to back this with the credible certainty of military intervention. The reasonable, but unfulfilled, expectations of many of our citizens that we should never again witness on European soil what we see in Kosovo undermines the credibility of the European Union. My group believes that foreign policy is an area where decidedly we need more Europe, including a Europe with a security and defence capacity.  Enlargement challenges all of us to rediscover Europes essential task. The great prize which it offers is political and security stability across the wider continent. The ELDR welcomes the decision to open the Conference on Accession at ministerial level next month. As we face a difficult debate on the future financing of the Union and Agenda  2000 , we must not lapse into an arid, sectional and narrow debate on budgetary policy, to the exclusion of the wider vision. Again, as we await the ratification of Amsterdam, the same logic applies to institutional reform. This now assumes a new urgency by going to the heart of the kind of Union we wish the applicant states to join. For the ELDR this is a Union both wider and deeper with a political and social as well as an economic mission, but also with the institutional capability to see it through.  We welcome the green light given to Cyprus but it now requires a deeper EUled engagement to resolve that problem under the aegis of the United Nations. This will require an evenhanded capacity to deal with all the regional political powers. In this regard, we deplore the continued failure of the Council to deliver the financial protocol for Turkey, and ask today how the presidency proposes to unblock this unhappy situation. The Vienna Summit will review the claims of other applicant states. My group commends in particular the progress made by the Baltic States, in the economic field in Lithuania and in human rights in Latvia. We note also with satisfaction the evolving situation in Slovakia and the renewed interest of Malta.  The prospect of deepening cooperation in the field of immigration and asylum policy is to be applauded. Concerted action can have a positive effect, provided it is not founded on the values of the lowest common denominator nor on any retreat from the  1951  Geneva Conventions fundamental approach to asylumseeking as an individual human right. We welcome the breakthrough in a statute to establish an international criminal court as a permanent structure to bring to justice those charged with crimes against humanity and urge that the preparatory work proceed.  Finally, we remain concerned about the fight against fraud in the Union, an issue with serious potential to undermine the institutions. We believe it is important to maintain a sense of proportion, but also where there is wrongdoing to ensure full accountability which so far, regretfully, has either been unforthcoming or begrudging. We need a more independent investigation process. The state of the Union reflects that where we have the political vision and will, we succeed; where we lack those qualities, we do not. Let us learn and apply that lesson.
7113031 author: Nancy LaCourt:  Mr President, I am grateful to the European Parliament for its unswerving commitment to the Commissions efforts to promote schemes for small and mediumsized enterprises, and in particular for its contribution to the Commissions  1997  report on the coordination of Community activities to assist SMEs and the craft sector.  It is vitally important for small and mediumsized enterprises to be able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by Community programmes to maximise their potential for innovation and development and above all job creation, an imperative necessity and our common objective.  I want to thank Mrs Thyssen for her motion for a resolution and her report, which I regard as extremely useful and constructive texts. I also extend those thanks to the other Members who contributed to this report, Messrs Cellai, Peter, Adam and Robles Piquer and Mrs Ferrer.  The Commissions report presents a structural review of Community measures for the benefit of small and mediumsized businesses and the craft sector, and illustrates the results achieved through the coordinated approach adopted by the Commission to ensure that all Community policies take account of the interests of SMEs and facilitate their access to Community programmes.  As always, and especially on questions relating to SMEs, the European Parliament has a vital contribution to make and it comes at just the right time, since negotiations have started on the proposals to reform the Structural Funds for the  20002006  programming period, and also on new programmes like the fifth framework programme for research and technological development and the new Leonardo programme.  Clearly, effective coordination will bring tangible advantages for SMEs. Progress has already been made, as is underlined by the Thyssen report, but the Commission is committed to achieving even better results in the future. I would also like to mention the role of the group of Commissioners, chaired by Commissioner Papoutsis, who are looking at small and mediumsized businesses and the spirit of enterprise.  Our intention is to make further improvements in the coordination of the Commissions activities as regards programmes and measures to benefit SMEs. I can assure you that the Commission is committed to achieving that aim, and we broadly agree with the recommendations set out in the motion for a resolution.  In particular I want to stress the crucial importance of three questions: first, the need for the Community definition of small and mediumsized enterprises to be used in all the Community and national programmes at European and national levels; secondly, the importance of facilitating SME access to the programmes, particularly in the context of the Structural Funds and the research and training programmes; and thirdly, just as important, the need for small and mediumsized enterprises to be more involved in planning the programmes that affect them by having their own direct representation.  I have a few more points to add. The risk of a massive increase in the number of regulations has been mentioned. That is a risk we must always bear in mind, but I would point out, to Mr Souchet in particular, that simplifying the regulations, with the needs of SMEs most in mind, is exactly what the BEST task force and the SLIM groups (Simpler Legislation and Internal Market) are working on  and they are beginning to show the first concrete results, as Parliament is well aware.  Mr Cellai raised a burning question  taxation  which often turns out to place a disproportionate burden on SMEs in terms of the level of taxes they pay and the paperwork involved. We now have a good example of how certain Commission activities, although not geared expressly to small and mediumsized companies in so many words, are actually geared to them in substance. I refer to the fight against damaging tax competition, which the  15  Member States have decided to undertake on a proposal from the Commission. Well, the fight against damaging tax competition is intended, once certain tax niches and tax havens have been closed, to allow Member States to lower their total internal fiscal pressure. It is usually large businesses that can take advantage of those niches and havens while small ones are unable to, but this time small businesses will be the ones which benefit most from the reduced fiscal pressure resulting from the fight against damaging tax competition. I will not go into the Commissions ideas about the possibility of applying VAT at reduced rates to highly labourintensive activities, an idea supported by Parliament but on which the Member States are still reserving their final position.  I would like to make my final observation on a point underlined by several Members, namely the position of SMEs in relation to structural fund programmes. Aware of the lack of detailed information, the Commission has launched a thematic evaluation on the impact of the structural funds on SMEs. The final results will be available before the end of  1998 . The first results of this evaluation confirm previous appreciations, that is share of structural funds dedicated to SMEs and typology of measures. Therefore, we cannot really say that the information is not available, although it may not be detailed enough in terms of distinguishing the size class of the beneficiaries, which is important.  Moreover, the Commission has undertaken an analysis of the financial engineering schemes for some countries which will be used for guidance for future programmes. It has to be borne in mind that Member States are primarily responsible for the evaluation and analysis of the performance of their Structural Funds programmes and they should be encouraged to provide more detailed and accurate data on SME participation. The study which I mentioned a minute ago will not lie on a shelf gathering dust. Its purpose is not only to gather useful data but also to make recommendations for the next programming period on how to improve SMEs measures and their implementation in future programmes.  Finally, I should like to mention also the fact that the Commission should issue guidelines in  1999  to help Member States in the preparation of their future programmes to be cofinanced by the Structural Funds. In this context, a very special focus will be placed on supporting SME development and entrepreneurship.
5992709 author: Roger Jones:  Mr President, this report is, in my groups view, of the utmost importance in the development of the democratic legitimacy and the credibility of this House. Of course, it should not be so. We should be judged here on the way we carry out our functions, to legislate, to monitor the work of the Commission and the Council and to set the budget of the Union. Sadly, that function, which I believe has been developed and carried out in a constructive and progressive manner during this parliamentary term, has been obscured by a barrage of criticism in all our countries in recent years.  That criticism which reaches a crescendo in our press with monotonous regularity centres on the system of allowances and expenses accruing to Members of this House. I want to pay tribute to the two Presidents of our Parliament during this parliamentary term. Firstly, Klaus Hnsch and now Jos Maria GilRobles have worked to introduce the reforms necessary to restore to this House and its Members a degree of dignity and public acceptability.  This is the first time I have taken the floor for my group on this issue in this chamber. In the last four and a half years I have been engaged in a continuous round of discussions within my own group and with my counterparts in the other groups of this House to ensure that we can now take the fundamental decisions necessary to solve this problem. This, in my view, represents the last opportunity in this parliamentary term to end, once and for all, this most damaging public vilification.  I for one hope passionately that tomorrow this House will adopt an appropriate package of reforms. We all know that there will be some out there who will argue that whatever we do it will not be enough. Sadly, there are some in this House who, over recent years, have deliberately and dishonestly added to the debate by misrepresenting and misreporting detail and motivation.  Let us therefore do what we believe is right, what we believe is defensible and what we believe our citizens will see as reasonable. Let us also be entirely open. It is clear that the issue of the expenses regime could not be solved until we also dealt with the inequality of Members salaries. The gross disparity between the salaries of Members doing identical jobs in equally trying circumstances in terms of travel, hours, inconvenience, the disruption of family life and so on, is simply not acceptable. It was of critical importance, therefore, that the intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam in June of last year included a request that the European Parliament bring forward a proposal for a Members Statute. The Rothley report is our response to that request.  In my groups view it is not acceptable to propose a Members Statute which simply pulls together the varying conditions, immunities and privileges of the  15  national parliaments of the European Union, collates them and then calls the result a statute for Members of the European Parliament. If this statute is to have some integrity and credibility it must look at the role of a Member of the European Parliament. We must define a statute which is appropriate for the work we do, the environment in which we work, the travel which is an integral part of our job and the incompatibilities which result.  I want to congratulate Mr Rothley for the extremely effective job he has done in this respect. I must say that there is probably no single Member in this House who will be satisfied with every aspect of Mr Rothleys proposals and I conclude therefore that he has got it about right. We cannot dodge the important issue of a Members salary so I propose to deal with it now. It is simply a fact that Members of this House should be paid the same salary. In any similar environment with working colleagues coming together it would not be acceptable that salaries with such diversities are commonplace. It runs counter to all logic and common sense and lies at the base of all our problems.  The big question has been just what is an appropriate salary for MEPs? Mr Rothleys average of the salary of all our national parliamentarians is an ingenious solution. It is not by any means the highest salary to be found amongst national parliaments nor the highest salary we could have proposed. Yet it represents an appropriate salary. It has the virtue of being transparent and understandable and my group rejects other formulations as being opaque and opening up the criticism that we are manoeuvring for some super, inflated wage.  In order to facilitate the clear problems for those colleagues who would suffer a substantial loss of salary under this system Mr Rothley proposes a transitional period, whereby in the next parliamentary term colleagues who are reelected can choose either the new salary or an existing one. While some colleagues are unhappy with that transitional phase, and I put myself in that category, it has to be recognised that we are talking in terms of a considerable downward movement of some Members personal income. Such a transitional period would at least give them the ability to plan their future. New Members will of course enter this parliament under the new system immediately.  The report proposes that salary should be subject to Community rates of taxation. This is a controversial proposal which I believe divides most groups in this House, and mine is no exception. Many Members feel that they wish to continue to pay the same tax rates as those fellowcitizens whom they represent. Others feel that they will be receiving a European salary and are entitled like others employed directly by the European Union to pay European Union tax rates. I think this one will come out in the wash, ie it is difficult to predict what the result of the vote in this House will be on this issue.  The other side of the coin of a single salary is a system of reimbursement of travel costs based on actual expenditure. For me this is fundamental. I cannot accept that we adopt a common salary and in the same breath continue to allow an expenses regime which is based on anything other than actual cost. I have no doubt that such a proposal would be entirely unacceptable to our citizens, our voters and indeed to our governments. Mr Rothleys proposals in this respect are excellent and I hope they will be supported. The compromise amendment tabled by my group and the Liberal Group with the rapporteurs active support, I believe, adds even greater transparency and clarity to this issue and I hope that it will command support.  The other and major section of this draft Statute is that of the incompatibilities and other elements which define our rights and responsibilities, our mandate and independence as Members of Parliament. A series of amendments in the names of many groups, mine amongst them, have been tabled which add balance to the report and I hope they too will be adopted.  If tomorrow we succeed in producing a draft statute we will have taken a first and major step to solve this long running and open sore. It will then be up to the Council to acknowledge the commitment of the Parliament and its Members, to take the very tough decisions which I hope we will do tomorrow. It will then be up to the Council to indicate that they are prepared to give the green light to the next stage, ie detailed interinstitutional negotiations so that a statute can become a reality before the European elections in June of next year. Time is short. Consensus on an issue of this sort is extraordinarily difficult to secure. We will tomorrow, I hope, secure the majority we need. Let us hope that in Vienna the Council can do likewise.
5650520 author: Sarah Reid:  Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for having supported the idea of an emergency procedure, and say how much the Commission appreciates the report by Mr Colino Salamanca. I shall merely draw your attention to the principal issues, in particular who will assume responsibility for the operation, which regions are to benefit, and the aspects related to monitoring.  Given the scale of the operation, the Commission is firmly convinced that it cannot be administered by nongovernmental organisations, as usually happens for food aid. The United States are of the same opinion as concerns their food aid programme. Therefore the operation must inevitably be carried out under the auspices of the Russian Government.  As for the regions covered by the programme, the products will be distributed to the poorest regions and those worst affected by the shortages. These include neither St Petersburg and the surrounding area, nor Moscow and its environs. A total of some  40  regions are included in the food aid programme. The large number of beneficiary regions will obviously make surveillance of the operation all the more complex.  With regard to monitoring, I would stress that the Commission is not able to exercise any control over the implementation of the programme within the Russian Federation; this has also been made clear at the General Affairs and Budget Councils, and again at yesterdays Agriculture Council. In the Commissions opinion, it is impossible to maintain thorough surveillance over the programme in the more than  40  regions concerned, not only because of the vast geographical area involved but also because Russia is currently in a state of internal turmoil. The distribution of food aid on Russian territory represents a highrisk operation, and no surveillance measures could entirely eliminate this risk.  The Commission has nevertheless taken note of the extremely firm stance adopted by the European Parliament and by several Member States in favour of incorporating surveillance measures into the programme, and has therefore made provision in the regulation for recourse to external technical assistance with monitoring, auditing, control and evaluation within the Russian Federation. This arrangement has already been accepted by the Russian Government.  The other provisions on monitoring, originally contained in the memorandum of understanding, will however be more important than the external technical assistance. First of all, the regions and areas benefiting under the programme are listed in the annex to the memorandum, with an indication of the products to be distributed to each of them. The Russian Government is to reach an official decision, which will be made public, on this annex.  Consequently, the governors of all the regions will be able to check whether the exact quantities of each product earmarked for their region have been delivered. Clearly, if that is not the case, protest mechanisms will be triggered. Secondly, the products will be despatched in several consecutive batches. Thirdly, the Russian Government will send monthly reports to the Commission on the implementation of the programme. These reports will contain all necessary information about the progress of the operation, by product and region, as well as a statement on the management and use of the special account. Fourthly, the European Court of Auditors is empowered to carry out audits in the Russian Federation concerning the food supply programme.  I would stress last of all that, should the Commission receive any information leading to reasonable doubt as to the proper implementation of the programme, it will be able to suspend the supply of aid.  I would conclude by stating that, in the Commissions opinion, the programme of food aid to Russia can be carried out under optimum conditions only if responsibility for the operation is shared by all the institutions, and if all the institutions realise from the outset  and before taking any decision whatsoever  that the programme is not free of risk. We have done everything humanly possible to minimise such risks, but we cannot do so altogether. On the other hand, nor can we sit back and refrain from assisting Russia for fear that the operation might misfire in some way.  Let me now review rapidly the amendments which the Commission is unfortunately not able to adopt.  Regarding Amendment No  1 , it has to be borne in mind that we, with the Russians, specify quantities to be delivered, which we have to respect. The amounts to be expected are estimates by the Commission services based on standard values which can be higher than expected, especially considering transport under winter conditions. A fixed maximum amount would risk, therefore, diminishing the quantities of the products to be delivered, which nobody wants.  As far as Amendment No  2  on the tender procedure is concerned, the only tender which is envisaged is one which designates the bodies or operators which will, on behalf of the Russian authorities, carry out the necessary work for taking over the transporting, processing and sending the goods to the final destinations. This tender procedure has already been accomplished by the Russians for both the European Unions food aid action and those from the United States of America.  As far as the NGOs involvement in this operation is concerned, the Commission thinks that, due to the enormous size of the transactions, only professional operators which have the necessary infrastructure could accomplish this task effectively.  Regarding Amendments Nos  3  and  7 , among the specific conditions agreed in the MOU, reexports of the food aid deliveries as well as the exports of the same commodities produced in Russia or imported from any other third country are explicitly forbidden. It seems to the Commission that underlining one of the conditions would weaken the others or risk giving them less importance.  As regards Amendment No  4 , it is clearly indicated in the regulation that the Commission shall call in outside technical assistance for monitoring, auditing, controlling and evaluating the proper conduct of the operation including on Russian territory. To specify that this technical assistance should be provided by a technical assistance office will not strengthen the text but rather restrict the kind of external control organisms which could be involved.  As far as the amount allocated for this kind of technical assistance is concerned, the same remarks are valid here as for Amendment No  1 .  It is not necessary to put Amendment No  5  in the text as the Commission has already made available the draft memorandum of understanding to the European Parliament. It is also clear that the Commission, in the framework of the early warning system, will give as usual all information to the budgetary authority concerning the execution of the operation.  Concerning Amendment No  6 , this provision is already in the memorandum of understanding and need not be repeated in the regulation.  Amendments Nos  8  and  9 : fisheries products were never mentioned by the Russians as products for which a shortage exists in Russia for the next winter. Therefore the Commission cannot include these products in the current food aid programme.  Finally, regarding Amendment No  10 , there are a lot of needy people in the Russian Federation. To specify each group or to highlight a specific one seems to us to be inappropriate.
7436108 author: Amy Finlayson:  Mr President, I would like to thank both the President of the European Council and the PresidentinOffice for their reports here this morning. I would like to congratulate Mr Klima. He brought a refreshingly realistic assessment to this Parliament, recognising both the successes of the Austrian presidency but also, where there are disagreements within the Union and where I am sure he has experienced the frustrations which we in this Parliament feel as a result of those disagreements. We do not often hear that sort of honest assessment given in this House and I hope it is a sign of things to come.  So I want to thank both Mr Klima and Mr Schssel very much for that and also for the efficiency, the diligence and hard work of the Austrian Government during their first presidency. Mr President, in your speech to the European Council on Friday, and again this morning, you expressed your thanks on behalf of Parliament for the way in which the presidency has cooperated with Parliament. On behalf of my group, I should like to add my thanks to the many ministers who have attended here and helped and supported the work of this Parliament. Particular thanks are due to Mrs FerreroWaldner who has been our regular partner here for the past six months. We offer our thanks.  The Austrian presidency came at a particularly awkward time, sandwiched as it was between the British and the German presidencies. In the former presidency negotiations were started to enlarge the Union  a momentous event  together with a decision on which countries should join the euro, the establishment of a central bank, arguably an even more momentous event. The forthcoming presidency is destined to conclude the Agenda  2000  package which is of immense significance for existing Member States of the Union and for enlargement.  So the presidency had to steer a path between one set of mighty events and another without having any of that timetable fall into its own lap. The Austrian Government is to be congratulated for making sure that the way ahead is clearly timetabled to Cologne and to Helsinki, that the decisions needed are identified and that the broad outlines of many initiatives are set. It was never the intention that major decisions which have absorbed the European press in recent days would be concluded at Vienna. In particular, it was never the intention that decisions would be made on future financing of the Union. Let us be frank and clear about that.  But it has been possible to continue the debate on some of the key issues facing the Union: the next stage in our employment strategy and a European employment pact. My group very much hopes that the initiative which the Council outlined in Vienna will allow us to establish a counterweight to the growth and stability pact which will secure future monetary security in the euro zone. Whilst the single currency will have a great impact on the lives of our citizens, employment is even more immediately crucial for every family in the European Union. In this respect, my group particularly welcomes the express invitation of the Council to allow those Member States who so desire to initiate reduced VAT rates on labourintensive services which are not exposed to crossborder competition.  This was a proposal which was put to the Luxembourg special summit in a report from this Parliament by my colleague Wim van Velzen and which the Council at that stage felt needed more analysis and assessment. Your agreement that such an idea could be an important employment generator gives us great satisfaction and we will certainly do what we can to facilitate progress on that in this House.  Chancellor, I note that in the conclusions the Council pays special attention to the fact that this moment coincides with the  50 th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Indeed, Mr Schssel mentioned it himself just now. The Council is asking the Commission to draw up proposals to counter racism in the applicant countries and invites the Member States to consider similar measures inside the Union. I want to commend the Council for calling for action in this very sensitive and important area. Perhaps we could ask you to take back to the Council an appeal from us, that it should issue a firm declaration that it will ensure that the European elections will be fought throughout the European Union free of manifestos or platforms which promulgate racist or xenophobic hatred or fear. Such a declaration coming from the special summit in March on the eve of the European election campaign would be an important signal of the Councils serious intent to fight the politics of hate wherever they are to be found in Europe of the next millennium.  An issue of particular significance already mentioned in this House and one which has absorbed an inordinate amount of our time is the question of the Members Statute. I want to thank Mr Klima in particular for his willingness to receive the draft statute so carefully developed by our colleague Mr Rothley. I recognise, as we all do, that the statute contains elements which will require detailed negotiation but I cannot stress how important it is that rapid progress is made if we are to have it in place for the June elections. We welcome the fact that the Council considers the draft an appropriate one on which to begin discussion.  We have our negotiating team ready. Could we ask you to press the secretariat of the Council to get on with it? It is political will that matters. Please urge your successors to get on with it. There are some in this House and many outside who have always argued the cynical case, that we would never get the agreement of the Council to put the need for a statute in the Treaty. Amsterdam did that. Then they argued that we would never find agreement amongst ourselves on a draft statute. Mr Rothley did that. They argued that the Council would never deal with it in Vienna. And you did that. Now they argue that we are deluding ourselves if we think we can reach a final result by the time of the European elections. Together we can do that. I urge the Council to help us demonstrate that we can now conclude this issue fast and fairly.  I would like to mention just a few issues concerning third countries. The agreement with Switzerland is a particular success. It is especially noteworthy that it should have been the Austrian presidency which resolved this problem and demonstrated the value of using the expertise and shared experiences of particular Member States with third countries. However, my group is increasingly irritated and disturbed by the length of time it is taking to find a solution to the negotiations with South Africa on the trade and cooperation agreement. I know you agree with me but we note that the Council expects that this will come to a conclusion in the next six months. Frankly, we must succeed.  On the day on which the European Parliament awards the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought to Ibrahim Rugova who struggled so valiantly for peace in Kosovo, it would be wrong not to pay tribute to the work of the European Union in working for political dialogue, peaceful solutions and humanitarian support in that troubled part of our continent during the last six months. This debate should not just be about the Vienna Council. We all know that not every Council can provide dramatic, earthshattering changes. We here are always too ready to demand such results, in my view rather naively. So I want to pay tribute to the ongoing work of the Council in which the Austrian presidency can take particular pride.  I have already mentioned the much delayed agreement with Switzerland. Another very big success was the fifth action programme on research. For a year this has lain unresolved on the table: a programme which contains the fourth largest spending area in the Community budget. It is to the credit of your ministers that agreement was finally reached on this programme as well as many others in the past six months  a six months in which Austria can take pride.
4741861 author: Nancy MacLeod:  Mr President, I believe that the idea behind this directive is a good one. We know that in the European Union an increasing number of consumers buy goods in each others countries and this is likely to increase with the use of the single currency. We also know that when they do so, consumers are often underinformed and confused about the nature of the guarantees that go with the goods that they buy.  I have great sympathy with the point of view put forward by Mrs Sandbk. The easiest way of dealing with this problem would have been to introduce a simple measure saying that consumers must be informed as to their rights regarding guarantees in the country where they are purchasing goods at the time of that purchase. If they are buying something in Denmark they know they are in Denmark. They can look out of the window and see Danish people walking up and down speaking Danish. They are not going to get a French guarantee, they are going to get the Danish guarantee. I believe that simple move would have been a great improvement on the situation as it is at the moment in many Member States.  The difficulty of that would have been that it would put the Consumer Directorate out of a job in the European Commission. The lure of a harmonising directive has proved too much for them. So in this draft directive the Commission has sought to harmonise the nature of the guarantee offered in all Member States and consumer rights under that guarantee.  The Commissions association with the directive has not been happy. The original text was very badly drafted and the impact statement said simply: Compliance costs are negligible. This was roundly contradicted by the economic impact statement produced for the Commission by the Wilhelm Consulting Group, which found substantial increased costs likely to arise in some retailing sectors. The Council has now improved the texts. We have to say that the common position is preferable to the original and to what I describe as the rapporteurs tinkering with the text.  The Commission has also extended the scope of the directive to cover all secondhand goods. How realistic is this? Would it apply to goods sold, for example, in charity shops and car boot sales? If the sellers here had to offer a minimum oneyear guarantee, as the directive states, surely this directive would threaten their future operation? Neither the Commission nor the Council of Ministers has thought through the implications of extending a minimum oneyear guarantee to secondhand goods. Article  7  makes it quite clear that this guarantee would cover all secondhand goods for at least one year. Do they know about that at Oxfam? Are they happy about that at your neighbouring car boot sale?  In opting to cover secondhand goods the Commission has inadvertently included within the scope of the directive sales of art, antiques and collectibles. Three of the four remedies provided in the draft directive could not possibly apply to them. How does one replace or repair a Canaletto? Reduction in price would be very difficult to agree. Amendment No  34 , which I am moving with Mr Whitehead, offers the possibility of excluding the sellers liability for any lack of conformity in such cases. I hope this commonsense amendment will find favour.  Finally, the directive and the rapporteur show a touching faith in human nature. The directive tries and fails to clarify the rights of the ignorant consumer but, in fact, it offers aid and comfort to the unscrupulous consumer who will be only too happy to use all legal loopholes created in order to demand replacement of goods or reimbursement of the purchase price. Mrs Kuhn has made things much worse.  To sum up, there is one and only one group of people who will benefit from this directive: Europes lawyers. If it is adopted, this directive, I can confidently predict, will encourage legal uncertainty and increasing litigation. Europes consumers have very little to gain from it and Europes small businesses will pay for it. Mr Santer promises less law but better law. This is more law and worse law.
9191036 author: Sebastian Reid:  On behalf of the Green Group, I welcome this own initiative report on prison conditions in the EU and the proposed improvements and alternative penalties.  Concern has been growing throughout the EU about the unsatisfactory conditions in many EU prisons, where offenders are serving sentences for offences which are judged differently in different countries.  I welcome the fact that Member States are being called on to fully apply the Council of Europes rules in relation to prisons. The deprivation of freedom of movement should not mean deprivation of all fundamental freedoms  freedom of thought and opinion and freedom of political and religious beliefs, as well as civil rights must be respected.  I also welcome the series of measures designed to improve prison conditions and facilitate subsequent reintegration into society. The special account given to the specific needs of women prisoners is very important. So too are the recommendations to protect the social and family environment, medical services, including special services for addicts, and more humane laws on penalties for young offenders.  Exploring the concept of amnesties, alternative penalties and highlighting the importance of training of prison staff and social workers is the direction we should be aiming for in regard to future policy.  It is also very important that we look at the problem of criminalising drug addicts. This is not going to solve the problem, in fact it ignores the problems of drug addicts who are only harming themselves and contributes to the overcrowding in prisons. Adopting a policy of rehabilitation for addicts and help to reintegrate into society would be the more logical approach.  As regards Irish prisons, the Irish Penal Reform Trust has made many useful and constructive proposals to the Irish Government and has highlighted some of the serious problems with the Irish prison system.  The Trust has a number of concerns about the treatment of Irish prisoners. For example:   40   of prisoners have no access to incell sanitation. They must use a chamber pot, sometimes in a shared cell, and slop out each morning. Some prisons are greatly overcrowded. On  15  July  1998  Cork held  177   of its design capacity ( 266  inmates in a prison built for  150 ). In closed institutions the facilities for recreation are extremely limited. Medical treatment for prisoners has been strongly criticised by individual inmates, visiting committees and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. Psychiatric and psychological services are limited and widely spread. This leads to excessive use of padded cells (resorted to  500  times in Mountjoy prison in  1997 ). There is little independent monitoring of prison conditions. No inspector of prisons and visiting committees are uncritical and lack credibility. It is difficult for prisoners to maintain family ties. Contact visits are rarely allowed and correspondence is censored. Prison officers initial training is brief and does not devote sufficient time to human rights issues. Prison Governors have no control over their budgets or staff rosters. They are not allowed to govern.In combination the above limitations can create an environment where human rights are not taken seriously. This means that poor treatment is unchallenged and even becomes acceptable. In this way low standards become the norm.  Potential ill treatment rarely comes to light because of the culture of secrecy which characterises the Department of Justice.  There is a perception in Ireland that the poor are treated differently by the courts. Studies of the prison population show a clear preponderance of uneducated, unemployed, drugaddicted, young men. There is clear evidence to show that the poorest defendants are more likely to be imprisoned than fined, and even if fined they may end up in prison in default. Also some courts allow a contribution to the poor box as an alternative sentence. This clearly favours the wealthy.  Sentencing practice in Ireland is unclear. If justice is to be done then patterns of sentencing must be analysed and areas of discrimination eliminated. There is no tradition of criminal justice research in Ireland which means that policies are often based on intuition and expediency and not on facts and principles.  Another problem is that remand prisoners are not held apart from those who have been convicted and sentenced. As they must be available for the courts, they are held in committal prisons where conditions are cramped and unsanitary. These people experience the worst elements of the Irish penal system and this is unacceptable in view of their legal status as innocent citizens.  In  1999  a new purposebuilt remand prison will open at Cloverhill. This should be an opportunity to create an environment for remand prisoners which recognises their special needs. However, the design quality of this institution leaves a lot to be desired. Despite the fact that international guidelines suggest single cell occupancy as the norm, overcrowding will be a feature of this new prison as soon as it opens. Inmates will be held in triple cells. These are small and cramped, measuring only  10 . 7  m.  The Irish situation is not unique and it is clear that similar problems exist in many other EU Member States.
8951085 author: Helen White:  Mr President, may I begin by saying that I am slightly sad to be speaking on behalf of Mr Elliott who, because of the delay caused by the debate on the situation in Iraq, is unable to be here to present his own resolution. I regret that shift in the agenda meant that I had to replace him.  I also have to confess I was sorry to miss the press conference given by Mr Mgret, Mr Blot and Mr Le Gallou earlier today explaining their current situation in the Front national . I am normally against war  civil or otherwise  but I make an exception in that particular case.  With respect to the resolution, I wish to draw Members attention to a number of points. Firstly, paragraph  1  states the need for the urgent ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty. Members will be aware that we have a new Article  13  which will allow the Commission, for the first time, to introduce legislation to organise the fight against racism, xenophobia and antisemitism. However, that can only be done once the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified. I hope that the French, who are the latest in ratifying this Treaty, can do so as soon as possible. I urge them to take the opportunity to introduce legislation prior to  10  June so that the Commission proposals can be part of the debate around the European elections.  I hope that, as stated in paragraph  3 , legislation will incorporate many of the ideas brought forward by the Starting Line Group which has been working on proposed legislation for a number of years. What we require in the field of fighting racism is detailed and hardhitting legislation. I do not want the Commission to be frightened by the view, expressed by some, that certain Member States will not accept such legislation and such legislative proposals. We should not forget that it is only fairly recently that the  15  Member States signed up to Amsterdam and I am convinced that, in signing up to Article  13 , they are agreeing to introduce legislation.  I must also draw the attention of Members to paragraph  10 , which argues that in the next Treaty revision, we should seek to introduce qualified majority voting in this particular area.  Paragraph  4  mentions the idea of a code of conduct for political parties; a code of conduct which makes political parties commit themselves, firstly, not to engage in racism, not to use racist language and not to use racism as part of their political campaigns; and, secondly and equally importantly, not to associate themselves with parties that breach the code of conduct. It would be very fitting, in the light of Parliaments campaign over the best part of fifteen years for legislation at a European level, for such a code of conduct first to be used by political parties in the runup to the European elections in  1999 .  Paragraph  6  mentions the new European Observatory  the Monitoring Centre set up in Vienna. Beata Winckler, the Director of that Centre, is actually in the gallery listening to this debate. I should like to thank her for the work she has already done as the new Director, and the Board of the Observatory, in particular Jean Kahn, who is still recovering from a stroke, for the work they have done in its establishment. However, I have to say to them that we have high expectations of the Observatory. We do not expect a dull, desiccated statistical report every year: what we want are reports on what action should be taken at local, regional, national and European levels to fight racism when it arises and to prevent its rise. We want to use the observatory as a thinktank, to try to make sure that we bring forward the appropriate proposals.  Paragraph  7  mentions a European Network to monitor Racism and Xenophobia. It is very important that the Observatory uses this. We do not want them to reinvent the wheel: we want them to draw on the expertise already available in Community groups and other organisations in the  15  Member States of the Union.  Despite introducing Mr Elliotts resolution, I have to say that personally I have some doubts about paragraph  12 , which calls for small local groups to be supported by the Commission. It is important for small local groups to receive assistance, but maybe on the basis of subsidiarity this should come from regional and national organisations. The bureaucratic problems of getting the Commission to reach down to small local groups are too difficult to overcome.  Paragraph  15  rightly mentions our demand that the applicant countries are required to guarantee the rights of minorities. I have to say to the applicant countries that perhaps some of the justice and home affairs issues may be more of a barrier to membership than some of the discussions taking place on agriculture and the Structural Funds. I think Parliament will be very resistant to allowing in Member States which do not respect the rights of minorities  whether they are ethnic, linguistic or religious  or, for that matter, people who have a different sexual orientation.  Finally, I plead for crossEuropean action at the policing level. This is important. I should like to give one example: currently there is a growth of racist music around Europe. There is a band  if it can be called that  with the name No Remorse, which is short for No remorse for the Holocaust, whose latest CD is called Barbecue in Rostock, celebrating the petrolbombing of immigrant hostels in Germany. To my shame, it is a British group. The CDs are produced in Denmark and Sweden and are sold on the streets of Germany and Spain. If we are to tackle those problems, it is very important to tackle them at European level, because it is clearly a crosscountry problem.  I commend Mr Elliotts resolution to the House. I hope it will be supported when we vote tomorrow, because it is important that this House maintains the eternal vigilance necessary to ensure that the tragic events of  50  years ago are not repeated in the future.
5952458 author: Helen McNabb:  Mr President, this debate is important, is necessary, and is inevitably for many here a painful debate. It is about public accountability and how and where to draw the line. It occurs at a critical stage in EU affairs. For my group I want to say that we all share a consciousness about achieving the strategic agenda: the standing of the euro, the exploitation of the new powers foreseen in the Amsterdam Treaty, Agenda  2000  and enlargement, to name but a few. In this regard, as institutions with a European vocation, the Commission and Parliament are natural allies. But in addition to its legislative and strategic agenda the Commission is also responsible for the daytoday management of EU affairs. It is the job of this Parliament to ensure that these affairs are subject to democratic control and public accountability. This House is the bar of public accountability before which the Commission is held accountable for its conduct in office. In this domain it is natural to expect a certain degree of creative tension between the Commission, as executive, and Parliament. This is healthy in any democracy.  We are holding this debate now because twice in the past  12  months the Commission has failed to win discharge for the  1996  budget, and because in advance of our vote on  17  December  1998  the Commission insisted that in the event of a negative outcome Parliament must clarify the situation by proceeding to a vote on a censure motion. Many colleagues, across all political groups, while respecting the right of the Commission to adopt whatever political strategy it saw fit, deplored something they saw as tantamount to an interference in advance with parliamentary procedure and sovereignty.  Applause  While none can ever be certain, it is my strong personal conviction that the Commission turned a possible triumph into a certain defeat by that illtimed intervention. It is the European Commission which drew this debate upon itself. In the opinion of the ELDR Group, a confidence debate opens a wider field of political vision and perspective. This is not simply a reheating or recycling of the  1996  budget debate. Procedures through the Committee on Budgetary Control provide the prospect of dealing with this affair in due course and by due process. In this debate we have crossed a line from the politics of accounting to the politics of accountability.  The Treaty confers on Parliament the right to censure only the entire college of Commissioners. This is a crude and indiscriminate instrument. In popular terms it is often correctly described as the nuclear option, where on hitting the censure button the entire Commission is meant to disappear. Like nuclear weapons themselves, it is so drastic a measure that it commends caution in its deployment.  My group believes that the European Commission is a political body. Some argue that the Commission is merely a body of appointed bureaucrats. There are certain key characteristics which distinguish bureaucratic from political systems. The public perception of bureaucracy is one of red tape and endless buckpassing. Passing the buck, shifting problems from one source to another, and not accepting ultimate personal responsibility, are among the negative features often associated in the public mind with bureaucrats. In politics the buck must stop somewhere. That is what the politics of democratic control and public accountability are all about.  The Treaty confers on the Commission the status of college. The collegiality of the Commission is founded on the concept of collective responsibility. In every Member State cabinet government operates on the basis of collective responsibility. From time to time national cabinets and their credibility are threatened by individual ministerial or policy failure for one reason or another. In all our democratic systems the undertaking of personal responsibility by ministers for various shortcomings or conflicts of interest, and occasionally their resignation, is seen as a strength, not as a weakness, of the system.  Applause  This recognises that, sometimes, making everyone responsible effectively means that noone is responsible. Why should that be the case for the European Commission? Some will answer: But that is the law. Yet Article  159  of the Treaty anticipates the possibility of Commissioners resigning without reference to specific circumstance. Article  160  provides for a tougher remedy in respect of individual Commissioners. While I accept that the Treaty makes no reference to the right of Parliament to censure individual Commissioners, it is silent on the right of Parliament to demand an individual, clear political preference in respect of the conduct of Commissioners affairs.  Last month the Commission empowered itself to demand of this House a vote of confidence through the censure route. The Commission has no legal right, as has been said, to do that. But politically it made the choice. This month we can borrow from the Commissions precedent. Let Parliament empower itself to call on individual Commissioners to consider their positions even if no formal legal base exists.  For some years now Parliament has demanded the right of individual censure. This aspiration has not yet been accommodated in law. It has been expressed today by us only in an abstract form. Todays debate, in a concrete way, challenges each individual MEP to consider whether politically the circumstances exist to warrant a clear political statement demanding individual responsibility.  My group was appalled, politically speaking, at the blandness of the terms of the Socialist pseudocensure motion of December. It offered political carte blanche to the entire Commission and in the light of the information available to us, it would have been incomprehensible for us to support it simpliciter . Equally, to sack the entire Commission would appear disproportionate. Consequently our strategy was to add to the censure debate an oral question.  In our motion for a resolution we have called on two named Commissioners to consider their positions. I want it to be understood in the clearest terms that we are not acting in place of a court of law, nor as a public prosecutor; we are making no presumption about guilt or innocence since these belong to the judicial domain. We are charging noone with personal fraud or rank corruption. We are simply calling a political judgment that the rot in terms of mismanagement, irregularity, fraud and petty corruption will never stop if every Commissioner can constantly rely on the legal shield of collegiality and avoid personal responsibility.  Loud applause  This is the political issue at stake. This is the choice that the House must make. We must cross the bridge; we must move from aspiration and the abstract in a concrete form to demand that individuals be accountable for the mismanagement in their own areas of responsibility.  Loud applause
10300148 author: Frederic White:  Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to Mr BernardReymonds balanced and wellreasoned report. I am glad to see that for many parts of the House, in particular Mr Swoboda, Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Porto, there is considerable support for its balanced approach. The European Union has a profound interest in helping the emergence of a stable, prosperous and open China that embraces political pluralism, free markets, the rule of law and assists in building a secure international order. To those such as Mr Dupuis wing who believe that we have not been strong enough on the human rights situation, or Mr Ephremidis who approaches things in a rather different way, I have to say that I do not believe that they have put forward a real alternative.  The essence of our approach is that it is a longterm one. It has to be pursued in good times and in bad, unless there is a fundamental change in the situation. There is no doubt that both economically and politically the situation in China today is less hopeful than it was even a year ago. I do not believe that is a reason for fundamentally changing the approach we have followed or the one that is commended by Mr BernardReymond both in his speech and in his report.  The adoption of the report is timely. Under Prime Minister Zhu Rongji China has launched a series of key economic reforms. Against the backdrop of the Asian crisis, however, these reforms are likely to come under pressure this coming year as economic growth slows. Recent events in China have also given rise to serious concerns related to respect for human rights. In these circumstances it is important  indeed essential  for us to convey the right signals to China. Our communication set out a number of fundamental objectives.  Firstly, we want to engage China further through an upgraded political dialogue into the international community. Over the past decade China has taken welcome steps on arms control, nonproliferation regimes, on preserving the global environment, combatting international crime and drug trafficking. We should build upon Chinas desire to be recognised as a global responsible actor on the world stage and develop dialogue on global issues of common concern. The history of the past shows that can yield practical results and is not just an idle dream.  Secondly, we need to integrate China further in the world economy by bringing it more fully into the world trading system and by supporting the process of economic and social reform that is under way. China is the fastest growing market for European goods and services. It is clearly in our interest to bring it more fully into the global economy. Access to that market is too restrictive. We do not want to retaliate though by creating a selfdefeating cycle of protectionism. On the contrary, the openness of the European market will constitute our best contribution to helping China face the current crisis in Asia but we remain committed to opening markets further, including Chinas. To the proposition that China should join the WTO, the answer is Yes, but on commercially meaningful terms, agreeing to the opening up of its economy. That is appropriate for a country of its size and state of economic development.  I make no apologies for referring to the question of size. It is the case that in a country the size of China  and it is not going to disappear and it is not going to change because we say nastier things or pass nastier resolutions  it is only by engaging honestly, economically and politically, being frank and candid, that we stand a chance of bringing about change in that country. The European Union is dedicated to supporting Chinas transition to an open society based upon the rule of law and full respect for human rights. Of course we are not satisfied with the current situation in China. We have chosen a pragmatic and resultsoriented approach on this issue in which we challenge the Chinese authorities on issues and events of concern to us such as the recent spate of dissident trials and arrests. We are not silent on those issues but, at the same time, we expand our areas of cooperation. Both poles of the policy are necessary.  The dialogue on human rights has been useful but we have made it very clear to the Chinese authorities that we now need to achieve specific and tangible progress to maintain the credibility of this dialogue. Recent developments in China that have been referred to have underlined that need. We have asked for the release of dissidents imprisoned after the recent crackdown and that issue will remain on our agenda until these dissidents are released.  Most importantly, we have made clear to the Chinese authorities that we will identify benchmarks by which progress in the dialogue will be judged. This innovation will ensure that the necessary pressure and momentum in the dialogue is maintained. The question arises: What kind of benchmarks? The kind we will be looking at include the following demands: Firstly, we need more detailed information on political prisoners, their number, the charges on which they have been sentenced, their health conditions, as well as access to some prisoners for European and NGO representatives.  Secondly, we want to see specific steps taken to improve prison conditions and reform the penal system, including conditions of appeal and access to judicial review in line with international standards. The latter point is particularly relevant with regard to the death penalty and the situation of dissidents convicted for socalled counterrevolutionary crimes.  Thirdly, we want to see benchmarks for progress towards the ratification of the United Nations Human Rights Covenants which includes the followup to Mary Robinsons visit and closer cooperation with the European Union within the human rights dialogue.  Fourthly, another category of benchmarks relates to ethnic minorities especially those in Tibet. It covers a wide range of issues such as the transparency of demographic information, the free use of the Tibetan language as well as open and clear information on alleged incidents involving ethnic minority groups and dissidents.  Despite these recent differences on human rights, I hope you will agree that European policy towards China, as exemplified by the Commission communication and Mr BernardReymonds report, has progressed significantly in a positive direction in recent years. I am heartened to see that our communication and your report are broadly in agreement with each other. That applies to Hong Kong as well. I am sorry that I am not able to promise an early opening of a delegation in Macao. We are having great difficulty in getting the resources and support we need for the delegations we want to open. We will certainly examine the specific suggestions made in the report and incorporate them as fully as possible into the substance of our relations with China.  The challenge of developing a comprehensive and robust relationship between China and the European Union is one of the great geostrategic challenges for the next century. It is my belief that we have laid solid foundations to allow the European Union of the future to meet such a crucial challenge and that we should be steady in our approach, firm in what we have to say but balanced in our policy.
9222755 author: Nancy Jones:  Madam President, in its proposal to extend and deepen the base of energy taxation the Commission will have the support of Parliament. The energy tax directive is timely in terms of our commitments to reduce global warming and is desirable as a means of promoting greater energy efficiency and encouraging a lower energy intensity per unit of output; furthermore, it is necessary to explore new tax bases if we are ever to tackle successfully the structural difficulty in too many of our States of lowering nonwage labour costs in societies suffering unacceptably high rates of unemployment.  We in Parliament will say yes to new taxes but no to more taxes. Regrettably Parliament cannot insist in law on fiscal neutrality, but it does so as a matter of political conviction. Member States and the Council will betray the wider public purpose of this proposal if they fail to use the extra revenue from energy tax to offset excessive nonwage, taxdriven labour costs. We insist on such a tradeoff because, to reiterate the point, this Parliament wants new tax but not more tax.  The Commission proposes an extension of the excise tax regime on hydrocarbons to a much more comprehensive tax base, including sectors that have heretofore been excluded in some or all of the Member States  sectors such as coal, gas, electricity and homeheating oil. Parliament supports this as commendable, yet no sooner is this tax base definition established in the Commission proposal, than, through a complex series of total or partial exemptions, total or partial refunds, which variously are mandatory or optional, the Commission proposes a form of tax governance based more on exceptions than on rules. This, in our view, is a bad legislative proposal because it is too complex. It lacks the characteristics of good tax law, which should be simple to understand, easy to collect, predictable in its statutory implications and difficult to evade.  I should say that some colleagues confuse this proposal with the CO 2  tax. This is not a CO 2  tax directive. The Commission services, and ultimately the College of Commissioners, have submitted to Parliament a proposal which, we believe, reflects too many of the priorities of the lobbyists with which they have dealt and too little concern for the wider public interest.  In first studying the proposal, I recalled the rather unkind remark about a recent presidency in the United States, which likened the behaviour of the President to a cushion which, it was reported, always bore the marks of the last arse to sit on it. In some respects, the exceptionalism in this document appears to me to reflect that kind of logic. This is the kind of legislative proposal that has to stop. My report proposes radical surgery to remove the glut of exemptions but still proposes the retention of green exceptions.  On tax deepening, we believe the Commission has opted for an unnecessarily complex formula. We propose starting with the Commissions Year  2000  tax rate proposals and then applying an accelerator formula, subject to fiveyear review, but which would stay in place pending the outcome of the review. It has the advantage of clarity and certainty and avoids the endless institutional complications of the alternative proposed to us.  There remains the outstanding difficulty about firms and sectors whose costs may dramatically increase to the point where their competitive position could be destroyed. We do not ignore this issue: we propose a form of constrained subsidiarity, where such firms or sectors can seek relief provided there are extenuating circumstances, but where they must pass a wider EU test for objectivity so that they do not violate the rules of fair competition or the rules related to state aids.  I also propose an additional amendment at this stage that sectors where this is systematic should potentially be subject to a Commissionapproved block exemption or refund.  In summary, the European Parliament will support new energy and ecotaxes, but does not support more taxes. We demand fiscal neutrality of the states. We insist on lowering labour taxes as the counterpart of this tax. We want a simpler and more certain taxbased definition than that proposed by the Commission. We want a more predictable basedeepening formula for determining the evolution of tax rates. We want competitive handicap to be addressed where it is a genuine problem but not to be used as an excuse for going soft on necessary change. I commend the report to the House.
3432694 author: Nancy Reid:  Mr President, I am very glad to be able to present my report on the water framework directive for this first reading. The path of this proposal has been almost as tortuous as a salmon swimming upstream. I should like to acknowledge the personal contribution of my colleague, Mr Collins, in the long haul that has finally brought us to this first reading. In  1995  Mr Collins chaired Parliaments hearing on water policy that gave birth to the water framework directive. Perhaps we should call it the water baby, and he will be heartened to see his baby at last christened by this Parliament before he leaves us later this year. I should like to pay tribute to the little puddle of water rapporteurs  also present at the christening ceremony  which include my colleagues, Mr Florenz, Mrs Schleicher, Mr Eisma and Mr Collins himself, who also has a water report. We have developed amongst us an esprit du corps , whereby we have become waterminded, and that is a very useful thing to have done.  This proposal provides an historic opportunity to secure the Unions most basic need for adequate supplies of good quality water for todays and tomorrows generations. Its outcome will determine the future of the Unions water resources well beyond the Millennium. Reform of the Unions water policy is overdue and welcome. Piecemeal evolution has resulted in an incoherent body of legislation, with differing and sometimes conflicting methods, definitions and aims. The perilous state of much of the Unions water resources is plain to see from the evidence provided to us by the Environment Agency in Copenhagen.  The first report on Europes environment  the socalled Dobris assessment  sets out the problems in a clear manner and last year saw the publication of another assessment by the Environment Agency. Comparison of the two reports shows that progress still has to be made. The Dobris assessment reported that a quarter of Europes rivers are of poor or bad quality, with either sparse populations of fish or completely devoid of fish. Last years assessment noted that there has been no overall improvement in river quality. There has not been any significant improvement in groundwater quality since the first assessment. Europes groundwater is endangered and polluted in several ways, we are told. Problems include pollution by nitrates, pesticides, heavy metals and hydrocarbons, leading to eutrophication, toxic impacts in other parts of the water environment and possible effects upon human health. Moreover, despite the numerous international agreements and many statements of good intent, the implementation of Union water legislation remains poor.  The Commission, having taken part  and I am grateful to them for that  in the hearing which took place in  1995 , produced its communication in February  1996 . Following Parliaments response to the communication, a dialogue has been continuing between the Commission and myself. In that dialogue I voiced the concerns of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection about the early proposal. The Commission is to be congratulated on its response in providing detailed annexes and basic definitions missing from the original. I am also heartened by the constructive attitude of the present German presidency.  Before Parliament today there are  12  compromise amendments dealing with important issues where, in the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty yet to be ratified, I am pleased to present the results of a recent trialogue between myself, the Commission and the Council. These compromise amendments show a new willingness to move towards the Environment Committees position on wetlands, public participation, marine monitoring and underground gas storage.  This is, and has had to be, a complicated proposal. It aims to promote a sustainable use of water resources. Member States will be obliged to achieve good status for all surface and ground waters by a set date. Good status means a healthy ecosystem and a low level of pollution. These targets will be achieved by riverbasin management plans and backed up by Unionwide limits on pollution. The proposal sets out how Member States must identify river basins, appoint river basin authorities and ensure that they produce plans. The plans will stipulate what must happen for good status to be achieved, including pollution control, promoting more efficient use of water, regulating obstruction and introducing a charging system.  My suggestions for the reform of the Commission proposal are designed to address the considerable problems which continue to undermine the implementation of Union water policy. At the same time, my amendments seek to create a water policy framework which is both practical and ambitious. I urge that a tougher regime of pollution control is needed, the goal for the longer term, already contained in international conventions such as OSPAR, HELCOM and Barcelona, to which the EU and Member States are signatory, is the eventual phasing out of toxic substances.  In conclusion, I should like to repeat the importance of the proposal before us. What can be more important to the future of the Community than secure and abundant supplies of healthy water. This is the first piece of Community water legislation to apply to all surface and ground waters. It bases the management of these waters firmly on the principle of sustainable development.
5251952 author: Roger Reid:  Mr President, there is no doubt that we are voting a very important report tonight that will become a major piece of legislation. It affects a major developing industry within the Community but at the same time raises a series of major concerns to the general public that must be addressed. I have tried in this report to strike the right balance between the protection of public health, the environment, the rights of the consumer and the needs of that developing industry which has so much to give if we allow it to do so in the right way.  We have already successfully taken the report through the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. We have since then made efforts to find an even greater degree of agreement of the different parties involved so that we can find a proposal which we hope will be acceptable to the Commission as well.  There are many key points in the report. I should just like to outline some of them just now. First of all, we have introduced in the text an additional obligation on Member States in the Commission to adopt the precautionary principle and ensure that we avoid any adverse effects on human health and the environment whenever a GMO of whatever kind is released into the environment.  In the case of GMOs placed on the market, we must also be sure that they can be identified and tracked. We have tried to do that with some of our amendments; that the authorisation for release contains descriptive methods of identification and that a public register is kept of those methods so that we know where they are going, we know what they are doing. The monitoring requirements that we have installed in the proposal should help us to do this.  A concern that has been expressed by many people is that we have a problem with export of GMOs and a responsibility, indeed, when these GMOs go to third counties that may not have the capacity to deal with them in the way that the Union has. So we have introduced the principle of prior and formal consent.  Many concerns have been expressed by people across Europe about the ethical implications of genetically modified organisms that might shortly come onto the marketplace  even perhaps genetically modified animals. In that situation we have a right to consult an ethical committee. We are looking for the fullest consultation of the ethical committee on matters of principle. I am sure that will assist in the future introduction of GMOs that may present certain difficulties.  Any producer must accept that when they put a product on the marketplace they have to accept liability. Liability is an issue here just as it is for any other type of product. We are proposing a form of liability which is reasonable, comprehensive and no different from that suggested for other products.  We recognise that the long term implications of these products may indeed be such that there will be substantial socioeconomic effects. While we may not wish to address each of these issues, application by application, we have to consider these. We have installed a suitable amendment in the proposal to ensure that these are taken into account in an appropriate way.There are a number of other substantial improvements to the text in a technical sense. In the annexes we have worked very hard to improve the technical requirements and the definitions of the risk assessment. But equally we have looked very carefully at how we can control these products on the marketplace. While the Commission already has in its existing proposal the possibility to withdraw a product from the marketplace should it appear to present a serious risk to human health or any other risk, the Commissions proposal suggests that there should be a timelimited approval.  We are not against the idea of a timelimited approval. It is a sensible method of making progress, stepbystep. But one has to ask, when you consider the range of different products, what is the appropriate timescale for a timelimited approval? Is it three years, is it five years, as some of our Green colleagues proposed in committee; is it seven years, as the Commission is proposing; is it twelve years as the Council is proposing; or is it an unlimited approval as some Members of Parliament would want?  We have to accept that at this stage, in order to build public trust and confidence, there has to be a timelimited approval in order that any product which is found to be unsatisfactory can be properly withdrawn after due consideration.  I am not sure about the number. There is no magic number when it comes to the length of time. The Commission proposes seven years. I should be very interested to hear from the Commissioner why she thinks seven is the very best number of years  perhaps it is her lucky number. Are we going to suggest that it is twelve? Twelve would appear to be adequate on this technical question.
9343287 author: Christoph Bush:  Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Lagendijks report, not only because it supports the Commissions efforts to ensure a major reduction in marine pollution, but also because it is his first as a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism  I congratulate him on that. It is an accomplished piece of work, if I may say so, and in return for the support and the quality of the work, I am very happy to say that the Commission can endorse many of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.  Specifically, the Commission can accept at least the underlying principles of Amendments Nos  1 ,  3   4 ,  5 ,  12 ,  16 ,  17  and  18  (England  0 , France  2   I thought I might get that in). There is, however, another set of amendments which the Commission must reject, mainly on the grounds that it feels that the concerns expressed have already been dealt with in other parts of the existing text. I am sure that, on further examination, the honourable Members will understand and, I hope, accept that point. I refer specifically to Amendments Nos  6 ,  10 ,  14  and  15 . That leaves just  6  out of  18  amendments where there is a more substantial degree of disagreement with Parliament and I must say that, even in those cases, the divergence is not fundamental.  Amendments Nos  2  and  7  propose to extend the obligation to notify the onboard waste situation in writing to fishing vessels over  15  metres. Mr Lagendijk referred specifically to this in the course of his speech earlier on. The Commissions concern is that this could easily lead to an excessively bureaucratic system without bringing any substantial benefit to the environment. We should bear in mind, of course, that fishing vessels are not excluded from the requirement to deliver their waste in ports and to contribute to the cost of facilities. They are only exempted  I emphasise this  from the obligation to make a written notification before each port call. The reason for that is simply that most fishing vessels, obviously, have one or more standard ports where they normally land their catches. The prior notification proposal exists in order to allow the port to make the necessary arrangements for receiving waste from ships. In the case of fishing vessels, the port will generally be very familiar with the needs of the vessels, even without a written notification.  We also believe that the length limit of  15  metres, like any other limit, is bound to be somewhat arbitrary and therefore difficult to justify. For those reasons  we hope that the House will accept practical reasons  we cannot accept Amendment No  13  either. Having said that, however, I share Parliaments concern that if very big fish factory vessels were to be excluded from the statutory obligation, that would be very retrograde. I should like to reassure the House that those vessels are definitely subject to the notification and control obligations, since fish factory ships, which are not engaged in catching fish, are not considered to be fishing vessels under the terms of this proposed directive.  The most controversial amendment, as indeed Mr Lagendijk said, is probably No  8  on the charging system for the delivery of shipgenerated waste. Here the objectives of Parliament and the Commission are absolutely the same: all of us want to achieve a charging system in which ships are not given incentives to discharge waste at sea. However, we differ about methods of securing that objective. The Commissions proposal seeks to strike a balance between the need to make the best possible progress in encouraging waste delivery to ports and the plain political reality of taking into account the very different views of Member States on this issue. The end result of both Parliaments and the Commissions approach is that fees cannot only be based on actual delivery. Neither of us thinks that ships which do not deliver waste should be free from the fees associated with waste management. Our divergence, therefore, arises only from the fact that the Commissions proposal preserves a greater flexibility for the Member States in deciding the extent to which the socalled nospecialfee system will be applied.  In addition, we should bear in mind that ports, marinas and fishing ports in Member States are obviously very different, not just between but also within Member States. As I said, however, the fundamental objective of sharing the cost between users and nonusers is crucial if we want to encourage the delivery in ports of waste and reduce and, indeed, prevent the pollution of the sea.  Amendment No  9  is unacceptable because the Commission can adequately deal with competition matters under the powers it already has under the Treaty. The proposed amendment would have the effect of reducing those necessary powers merely to the possibility of making a proposal, and that, clearly, would not be in order. Again, I hope, on reflection, that amendment may be withdrawn.  Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No  11 , which relates to the number of spotcheck inspections to be carried out for control purposes. The Commission considers that a certain flexibility is needed, partly because of the potential future inclusion of the waste control regime in the existing port state control directive, which obviously would have exactly the effect anticipated correctly by Mr Jarzembowski. Our feelings arise partly from the fact that the main elements for enhancing compliance with this directive are not only set down in the control part of the directive. The Commission, therefore, considers that a slightly less systematic spotcheck system is adequate for the purposes of the directive and achieving the purposes of combating the pollution of the sea, at least as far as checks outside the port state control regime are concerned. Clearly, as Mr Jarzembowski said and as other Members have noted, in the course of the normal port state control check, it would be extraordinary if the inspector taking his  25   quota, as it were, were not to pay attention to the wastedisposal situation on board the craft. One could readily anticipate that will be undertaken  it is a relatively simple check.  One or two questions were raised by the honourable Members, to which I should like specifically to respond very briefly. Mr Sindal raised the question of wrecks in international waters. We recall in this House that he has fastidiously pursued the questions raised by the disastrous wreck of the Pallas in international waters. Currently, as the House and Mr Sindal know, just vessels are the responsibility of the flag state but we are all aware of the deficiencies of that system, and coastal states may get involved in order to protect their own environment. Clearly there is something to be desired in respect of using those powers as well. The House may be glad to know that the Commission is supporting discussions in the International Maritime Organisation about placing the mandatory responsibility for safeguarding against pollution and other effects of wrecks on the vessel owner. In my view, that could be a very real breakthrough in our efforts to achieve quality shipping in all waters, particularly in European waters. I hope that progress can be achieved without great delay in the IMO. Naturally we would prefer the standards to be global, if that is at all possible, and then followed up with a legal regime in our own maritime area. I hope we can embark upon that without great delay when the discussions are completed in the IMO.  Further, Mr Sindal also asked about VAT on waste disposal fees. That is a crucial question which is probably why discussions on the matter are still continuing. However, in the course of the further development of this legislation, I will be in a position to give a more specific response.  Mr Jarzembowskis point, which is well taken, that it is essential that the fees levied do not result in the distortion of competition between ports, because their rivalry is, to say the least, very interesting. After I retire I propose to write a novel about this to do them real justice  maybe a fairy tale, who knows! There will be differences in the level of the charges which arise mainly because of the relative efficiency or inefficiency of the system. If a port, because of its efficiency in handling waste disposal, is able to charge smaller fees, well the very best of luck to that port. What we are then seeing is effective competition and not a distortion of competition, as I am sure Mr Jarzembowski will agree.  I conclude by expressing my gratitude to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and specifically to the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, for the expeditious work and the excellent report on this detailed and important proposal.
5344104 author: James Merx:  Mr President, the events of the past week have revealed, perhaps for the first time ever, an expression of panEuropean public opinion. And if we ever needed a demonstration of the suspicion with which, sadly, the public across virtually all our Member States view the European Union institutions, we saw it in the collective sigh of relief and even, unfortunately, celebration which could be heard after the resignation of the European Commission.  It is important to state at the outset that the resignation of the Commission last Monday was not because the experts had found the twenty Commissioners guilty of personal fraud. In fact, the opposite was the case. They explicitly cleared the twenty of such accusations and allegations. As far as nepotism is concerned, it found only one Commissioner overwhelmingly guilty of favouritism with regard to work which was not within the European remit of the Commissioner. It criticised certainly two others for poor judgement in employing friends or relatives whilst acknowledging that the correct procedures for recruitment had been followed, and the work they had been engaged in had been of a European nature.  We should also be clear that accusations which were being bandied about in this House in December and January against other Commissioners, were overwhelmingly and largely dismissed. It is important that this House is grown up enough to recognise that fact.  However, the report was decisive in its conclusions regarding the loss of control of management by this European Commission; and it was right and proper that in the light of the conclusions the College took the decision to resign.  My group now expects the independent group of experts to complete the second part of its report on the structure of the European Commission. I give notice that I am concerned about voices I hear arguing that the group of experts have now done their job and should stand down. I want to caution against those voices. I am suspicious of their motives and their backing. I believe that it could be very convenient for some if the independent group of experts were to be prevented from delving in the required detail into the workings of different DirectorateGenerals. I therefore ask this House to make sure that the group is given the space to work and that the SecretaryGeneral of the European Commission be asked to ensure that his officials at every level cooperate to the maximum to facilitate the report.  In my groups view the second report must contain a more widelyranging review of the Commissions culture, practices and procedures. We want it to deal, amongst other issues, with how financial contracts are awarded and the procedures for contracts for interim or temporary staff to implement programmes, and to follow up allegations of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism involving staff. The group of experts is not in danger of removing or, in fact, countermanding in some way the powers of this House. To believe that, is to demonstrate a lack of confidence in our work.  This report and the one which will follow, is about something quite different. It is a procedure and process that is not unknown in any of our countries, in order to look from time to time at the culture which permeates administrations and executives in each country. Now is time to look to the future.  The European Commission is not in the habit of resigning. This is, after all, the first time in our fortytwo year history that such a thing has happened. If we are to demonstrate that the European Union can be different; if we are to respond to the opportunity of this moment, then we must call on the Heads of State and Government meeting in Berlin on Wednesday this week to designate immediately their nominee for President of the Commission. It is quite unthinkable that the European Commission, having resigned, should quietly continue with business as usual until the end of their mandate.  We want not just the President of the Commission replaced, but a new Commission in place with speed, properly ratified by this Parliament, using the powers which will be given to us in the incoming Amsterdam Treaty.  Given this background, the European Council should put forward an experienced, competent candidate committed to indepth reform, with a clear vision as to where he or she is going, with a programme to get there and credentials which are beyond reproach. What is clear, is that the new President of the Commission must assume not just the political responsibility for the Commission, but the political leadership as well.  This Parliament must also recognise the exceptional nature of this moment. We must not allow ourselves to engage in a constitutional or institutional debate about dry procedures and put up bureaucratic obstruction to change, and rapid change at that. The impact on European public opinion, if the European Council and the European Parliament were to come together to put in place a new Commission able to demonstrate its commitment to serving the people of Europe, would be instrumental in rejuvenating the vision of Europe.  Colleagues, our responsibility now is to address three principles to the Council. Firstly, we want immediate action to show we have grasped the moment; and we hope that the Council will accept the opportunity which the European Parliament has provided through the work of the independent group of experts. The first principle is immediate action. The second principle must be to insist on the use of the Amsterdam Treaty, whether it is formally in being or not as the way in which this Parliament will use our powers to ratify the new Commission; and our third principle should be for a strong candidate for the European Commission President, for a timetable for the new Commission to be in place and a strong and clear programme of reform. Those are the principles at which we should be looking in our deliberations over the next two days. I am sure those are the principles which the people of the European Union want to see as a result of the crisis that currently engulfs us. If we do that, working together, I believe that we have an opportunity now to demonstrate a new sort of future, a new sort of Europe for the next millennium.
7779812 author: Marc Corless:  Mr President, this has been a week without precedent with the resignation en masse of the European Commission. That resignation follows the damning report by the Committee of Independent Experts of the Commission as an administration that in too many instances was out of control and a system where too few people were prepared to accept personal accountability and responsibility for their conduct of public affairs.  I believe that Mr Jacques Santer is a decent man. His Commission included a number of positive and strategic achievements. The launch of the Euro, the conclusion of the Amsterdam Treaty, the preparation of Agenda  2000 , the opening up of enlargement negotiations. In part, the Santer Commission, ironically, has become a victim of its own willingness to examine fraud and corruption within the Commission. In part, it has been a victim of the chaotic, undermanaged and sometimes unmanaged growth of responsibilities during the Delors years.  Ultimately, however, this Commission was the author of its own demise. Over the past twelve months, in relation to the conduct of affairs with this House, Jacques Santer, unerringly if unwittingly, led his Commission to last weeks crisisinthemaking.  At every critical point during that period, he has caused the Commission to offer to this House solutions that, had they been offered at the outset of each stage, might have worked. In the end, and always at that stage, they proved too little and too late. For his own political misjudgements, Jacques Santer has paid the ultimate political price and with him his colleagues have resigned.  If this has been a difficult week for the European Commission, it has been a good week for European democracy. For the Parliament, this entire debate has represented a coming of age, a new maturity in understanding our democratic rights and our capacity and our duty to act in the public interest when we assert them. The system of governance in the European Union needs to be subject to more democratic control and public accountability. We believe we have crossed a new and irreversible threshold in that process. I might add that threshold is one we would never have crossed if we had followed the soft advice of a false sense of confidence commended by some to this House last December.  For its part, the European Parliament will no longer be prepared to be presumed to be the junior partner in European decisionmaking. It is not that the Parliament should be first among equals, but from now on it must be an equal among equals.  We find ourselves now in the process of creating a new, minimum and acceptable European norm for the management of public affairs and Community institutions which does not permit cultural exceptionalism. Hiring ones dentist to do work of dubious, if any, European value is not acceptable.  Now, Mr President, I hope you will allow an Englishspeaker to talk to you in French to suggest that the language of Molire might be enriched by a new and typically European concept, that of berthelisme , which means having a fictitious job paid for out of European taxpayers money. The members of the Acadmie franaise could immortalise this word by putting it in the dictionary. Purists could never accuse it of being franglais, not that I would ever dare to offer such an insult to the members of the Acadmie .  Last week saw the downfall of a Commission in which some members had already made a start along the road to berthelisation , and in future we will always be ready to condemn any Commission that again succumbs to the Berthelot syndrome.  Berthelisme , of course, Mr President, is not confined to the corridors of power of the European Commission. The European Parliament must profit from this occasion to clean up its own act.  We are vulnerable on the matter of top staff appointments. We remain vulnerable on the question of Members travel allowances until the system is radically overhauled. We are not yet as transparent as we could be or ought to be on our individual group and collective expenditures financed by public purse. We cannot demand in this institution, of other institutions, what we would not demand of ourselves.  The creation of new European norms of behaviour in office must apply with no less force and conviction to the European Parliament than they will to any future European Commission. The ELDR Group notes the implicit criticism of the Council in its role as one of the two arms of the budgetary authority for failing to give due and proper consideration to critical reports prepared by the European Court of Auditors on tourism policy on the MED and the ECHO Programmes. This failure by the Council to assume political responsibility should caution a certain modesty among those in some of our capital cities who seem prone to see the failings revealed in recent days as almost uniquely the creation of the European Commission. In this regard, we note with concern the relative ease with which the Council granted discharge for  1996 ; and we note with profound regret that on the very day of the publication of the expert committee report, the Council granted discharge, prematurely in our view, for  1997 . It is not an inspiring example of responsibility in action.  Where should we go to from here, is now the essential question. The ELDR believes that the Santerled caretaker Commission has lost its political and moral authority to act and so it must go immediately and be replaced by an interim Commission for the balance of its unexpired term. The appointment of the new millennium Commission, due to take place in January next, we believe, properly is a matter for the new Parliament with a new mandate, with new political balances and with new powers under Amsterdam. The current treaties already provide a way; and if the Council wishes to add to that the spirit of Amsterdam, then we can proceed to an interim Commission appointment through that means.  But let me make it clear that the renomination of Mr Jacques Santer or Madame Edith Cresson or some others to the interim Commission would not be acceptable to the ELDR Group in the light of recent events. Such nominations would risk provoking even deeper crises.  For our part, the Liberal group has consistently argued the merits of individual accountability within collegiality. To this end, we do not tar all the outgoing Commission with the same brush. We are prepared to judge each on his or her individual merit in the belief that not all were personally responsible for the ineptitude or incompetence of some.  Let me say to the PresidentinOffice that I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my Group to wish the Berlin Council well, and to say that we hope you will achieve the objectives of Agenda  2000  which are now more essential than ever. But let me also say in concluding that when we come to appoint an interim and future European Commission, my Group, which has been to the forefront in criticising the current Commission, wishes to make it abundantly clear, that our wish is for a strong, independent political Commission; and any attempt to weaken this in the future is one that we would resist in Parliamentary terms. The Commission needs reform and Union needs a strong, independent, politically reformed Commission.
6939943 author: James Smith:  Mr President, like Mr Brinkhorst I am also speaking in two capacities, firstly on behalf of the committee, and secondly on behalf of the Socialist Group. Firstly, I should like to congratulate my two companions in this long endeavour: Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Tindemanns. We started this process on  21  November  1997 . If I had known I was going to spend so long with them I would have checked with more care who they were going to be. However, I could not have picked two better companions. We spent a whole week together in North Korea and ten and a half hours in meetings with the deputy foreign minister. This would have produced any personality clashes there might have been.  Equally, I should like to thank Sir Leon Brittan for all his efforts to try to reach an agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament. It has been a long, hard road. I will not go into the detail because the points have been raised by the two previous speakers. We now have an agreement that I think Parliament can accept on the basis of the letter which has been sent today. I am deeply disappointed that the Council of Ministers, which apparently accepted an oral question for debate on relations with the DPRK, has failed to send anybody to participate in the debate. Perhaps they have been delayed and I should be glad to hear from you, Mr President, if that is the case. I presume we are expected to work out the Councils view on these matters by some form of telepathy.  KEDO, as you have been told, is a project to build two light water reactors to substitute for Russian design Chernobylstyle reactors that were under construction in the DPRK and which have the ability to produce weaponsgrade plutonium. To try and resolve that problem we have the USDPRK Framework Agreement of  1995 . The European Union was asked to contribute to that and this is what this comes from. The Research Committees view was one of critical support. We have a series of concerns. Firstly, a financial hole it still exists. Japans contribution of US 1  billion and the Republic of Koreas  60   and the European Unions US 85 m do not make up the full cost of the project. It is unclear how the gap is going to be bridged.  Secondly, we are concerned about how the United States is delivering the promised heavy fuel oil which is meant to act as a bridge until these two nuclear reactors come on line. It is being fitfully delivered. North Korea is a deeply suspicious country. We in the European Union might understand that the checks and balances of the US constitution mean that President Clinton cannot always clearly deliver on his promises but we can hardly be surprised that the North Koreans take a different view when, in the coldest month of the year and when energy is most needed, there was a failure to deliver heavy fuel oil to the Sonbong oilfired power plant.  Thirdly, we are concerned about the fact that KEDO is a bat without a ball. There is no money being put forward to connect the two nuclear power stations into the North Korean grid system. This is only going to cost  100 m or  200 m, comparatively small beer compared to what is being spent on the KEDO project as a whole, but, clearly, if you do not have the bat and the ball, you cannot play the game. Fourthly, we are concerned about the lack of clarity on the allocation of these enormously large contracts and whether European industry is going to get a fair opportunity to bid. Despite these reservations the Research Committee voted in favour of the programme. We believe that, overall, it serves our best interests as a Parliament and as a European Union in demonstrating our role in East Asia.  This debate is not only about Mr Tindemanns KEDO report. It also refers to two oral questions to the Council and the Commission with respect to future relations with the DPRK. We have been supplying humanitarian aid for some years following a series of natural disasters  flood, drought and tidal waves  that tipped what was a barely sufficient North Korea firmly into the red as far as food production was concerned.  There is severe malnutrition in North Korea. A recent World Food Programme report indicated that  16   of children between the ages of  1  and  6  are so badly malnourished that they suffer from permanent brain damage;  45   of children are so badly nourished that they will be permanently stunted. So,  300   000  to  400   000   06 year olds are permanently braindamaged and  1   000   000   06 year olds are permanently stunted. Therefore, I welcome the new agreement to supply further food aid of something over ECU  30 m and to target children under  12  and lactating mothers.  I welcome the agreement by the North Koreans on monitoring. After the events of last week it is vital for us in Parliament to be assured that the Commission is spending the money in the appropriate ways. I welcome also the assistance on agriculture  new techniques and maybe even new crops. I am disappointed, however, that nothing is being done in the nonnuclear energy sector. While I was there on the delegation I visited a coalmine and a thermal power station. Firstly, there was no power so the coalminers had to be evacuated. No coal would therefore be produced over an eighthour shift and the power station only had three days supply. Both were extremely primitive and I speak as someone whose family were coalminers in the United Kingdom in the  1950 s. Compared to the cost of KEDO, onetenth of  1   of the KEDO project would boost productivity in the coalmining industry  it has been estimated  by something like  25  , and modernise elements of coalfired power production.  On the political side I welcome the result of the Councils low level political dialogue with the DPRK and support the idea of a second meeting when the time is right. I welcome the Commissions communication on Korea calling for critical engagement. All I ask is that we move quickly. The situation is critical. We should not miss an opportunity. I know the North Koreans have asked for a liaison office to be opened in Brussels. I hope we can agree that can happen, subject to reciprocity in Pyongyang, and that subject to the necessary agreements we can move on to more developed relations.  Finally, I welcome the paragraph in the report that asks for a delegation to come here from the DPRKs Parliament. We will have hard and difficult negotiations with them but the dialogue has to start somewhere.
3596073 author: Frederic LaCourt:  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I say first of all that I am pleased that the general issue regarding Parliaments role in Euratom agreements has been settled and I can assure you that the Commission services will implement the practical arrangements we have arrived at. Before setting those out, I want to say that I very much agree with what Mr Tindemanns said about the role of KEDO as part of our Asian strategy and being an important contribution to it. We will come to North Korea in a moment but we have to look at our policy with regard to the region as one which has to be integrated, comprehensive and positive. As far as the problems we have had with Euratom agreements, I am grateful for what has been said about my own role in resolving them. I can assure you that I absolutely agree with Mr Brinkhorst that times have changed and we have to reflect that in what we are doing.  The measures the Commission intends to take are set out in a letter that I have sent to the President of the European Parliament today. That letter states first that at the beginning of each year, the Commission will provide a list of all the relevant Euratom agreements under Article  101 ( 2 ) which are under negotiation or for which negotiations are to be launched in the coming year. This list will be regularly updated and forwarded to Parliament under the necessary conditions of confidentiality. Secondly, the Commission will provide oral information on request to the relevant parliamentary committee on the conduct of the negotiations under the necessary conditions of confidentiality.  Thirdly, the Commission will forward the proposals for conclusion of the relevant Euratom agreements to the Parliament at the same time as they are forwarded to the Council for approval. That is a significant procedural innovation since it provides a guarantee to Parliament that it will be informed before the Council has taken a position on the conclusion of these agreements. Thus Parliament will have the opportunity to make its views known before a decision is taken to conclude the agreement in line with the commitments made in our earlier exchange of letters.  I should add that the time it takes for the Council to reach a decision on conclusion is generally fairly lengthy. That leaves ample time for Parliament to express its view if it so wishes. In those cases where the Council may wish to take a particularly rapid decision, the Commission will duly inform the Parliament of this possibility. Fourthly, by way of a letter, information will be provided on the relevant agreements under Article  101 ( 2 ) Euratom which are currently either under negotiation or for which a decision or conclusion has not yet been taken. The agreements referred to represent all agreements covered by Article  101 ( 2 ) Euratom which are under negotiation or for which negotiations are to be launched in the coming year.  Finally, in order to ensure that there is no further misunderstanding between the Commission and Parliament, the Commission will also convey separately to the Parliament all relevant texts and agreements which should have been covered by our understanding during the latter half of last year and the beginning of this year. That is what the letter says.  With respect to the report on the KEDO Accession Agreement it is a wellpresented and interesting document which addresses the fundamental aspects of the KEDO initiative. The visit of the parliamentary delegation to North Korea was regarded in a very positive way by the international community and I am grateful for the degree of attention Parliament has given to KEDO. I particularly endorse the conclusion which states that Parliament considers that the European Union should play a role in reducing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, increasing nuclear safety and encouraging the development of better relations between the DPRK and its neighbours and that membership of KEDO will enable it the better to play that role.  We are fully playing that role in the implementation of the Accession Agreement. We attend all KEDO board meetings and negotiating meetings with North Korea. The EU has staff in KEDO, including at director level, is following the procurement aspects  and here I can assure Mr Ford that we have every intention of ensuring that Europe gets a fair crack of the whip  and Europe has the chairmanship of the important International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group. We are paying our financial contribution which helps to ensure that the DPRK respects its nonproliferation pledges and we were pleased to note that the DPRK is now going to allow access to the socalled underground facility so as to allay international concerns. Security aspects are fundamental to peace and stability on the peninsular and the KEDO project is contributing to reconciliation between the two Korean governments. Indeed, it is a unique example of South and North Koreans working together.  KEDO itself is a special organisation where we are cooperating actively with our American, Japanese and South Korean partners to help improve security in NorthEast Asia. North Korea is also aware of our involvement not only through KEDO but also via the political dialogue which I shall refer to in answer to the question and by the European Union food aid programme. Indeed, it is the case that the Commission negotiators have recently reached an ad referendum agreement with their DPRK counterparts on conditions for a new EUR 30 m aid programme for  1999 . So we are contributing to a process of engagement with North Korea, seeking to encourage it to become a more responsible member of the international community.  We have to be realistic. There is an important, difficult and ongoing task to ensure security in NorthEast Asia and underpin the global nonproliferation regime. KEDO is a key part of that task and we will continue to remain in close contact with Parliament in the implementation of our participation in it. We will have to start preparing soon for the future of our participation in KEDO because the current agreement expires at the end of the year  2000  and we will be in close contact with Parliament following the procedures I referred to earlier. So I am very gratified to see that Parliaments opinion records approval of the Accession Agreement which will allow the release of the funds for the  1999  financial contribution. It is true that broader financial problems remain but the first thing we have to do is to play our part.  Turning to the question from Mr Spencer on the broader issue of relations with North Korea, I welcome the visit that was paid by the Members of the European Parliament to North Korea and I am glad that it was a successful bonding exercise. The negotiations I have had with the Members of the Parliament to deal with the KEDO problem have been a similar bonding exercise and I thank all concerned. There is no doubt at all, as far as relations with North Korea are concerned, that a crisis in the Korean Peninsular would have farreaching consequences in NorthEast Asia and beyond and we have a responsibility, commensurate with our new role in seeking to be involved politically in that part of Asia, to do what we can to avoid it.  President Kim Dae Jung has strongly advocated greater international engagement as a way of handling the problem and I can certainly assure you that we fully support, as Mr Brinkhorst has urged us to do, President Kims sunshine policy. America too is conducting a wideranging review of its policy under former Defense Secretary Perry. We have been pursuing a policy of limited engagement illustrated by the food aid and other assistance programmes, as well as by KEDO. We are currently discussing how that policy may now be taken further forward. An important factor will of course be the policies which the DPRK itself pursues in key areas such as security issues, relations with neighbouring countries, human rights and so on. We also have to take account of the need to support our key partners in their dealings with the DPRK. The EU regularly exchanges views with our dialogue partners, including the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan with regard to the situation on the Korean Peninsular. The idea that was put forward for further development in the energy sector is certainly one that we want to consider. Possibilities are being considered, including a study into alternative energy sources andor the coal sector rehabilitation.  On the political side we obviously have to tread warily but not so warily that we do not make progress. That is the course we shall pursue and I am grateful to Parliament for its support for it.
7319656 author: Alastair Bauer:  Mr President, we have a group of five reports and I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs. They have all done a very good job in producing reports which make an important contribution to this issue.  I should like first of all to focus on the justice and home affairs area which is covered by Mr Bontempis and Mr Wiebengas reports. They make a valuable contribution by stressing the need for the European Union to achieve a greater degree of harmonisation and of cooperation in this area. It is an area that has been sadly neglected compared with the great strides which the Union has made in harmonisation in the fields of economic and financial policy, agriculture, transport, the environment, etc. This area of justice and home affairs and freedom has lagged far behind. It is not that we want every country to adopt the same legal and judicial system  that would be absurd. Indeed, even within certain regions of existing Member States there are longstanding differences in the way that the law is administered and operated.  We need much greater cooperation. We are facing a situation where we have a proliferation of organised crime on an international basis. The criminals do not worry about issues of subsidiarity and frontier controls and whether the niceties of national law versus European law are properly abided by  they operate in whatever way makes them the biggest profit and achieves their objectives. Unless we are able to establish a proper system of international cooperation in this area then we will not be able to deal effectively with these issues.  This is also important in order to protect the rights of individuals. There is a tremendous disparity in criminal and indeed in civil law. There are many activities which are criminal in some countries but not in others. Sentencing policy varies widely. This is becoming more and more important as greater numbers of our citizens and residents of the European Union are working, living and carrying out their activities in other Member States.  It is unacceptable that somebody should have fewer legal rights if they are charged with an offence in a country other than their own than they would in their own country. Furthermore, problems have arisen of people being held for long periods without trial because of bureaucratic delays caused by translation problems and because of the lack of proper legal aid. These matters must be tackled and resolved, and the reports suggest some very important and useful ways in which that can be done.  Mr Nassauers report on Europol has the balance right. We must have effective collaboration between national police forces, and the Europol Convention provides for the proper and effective exchange of information to enable the police forces of our Member States to cooperate and to act more effectively by proper interchange of information, ideas and practices. Without this, police forces operating in the sphere of law and order will be working with one hand tied behind their backs compared with the criminal organisations.  One thing Parliament has always stressed from the very inception of Europol is that any international police organisation  perhaps in the course of time with operational powers, however limited they may be  can only be allowed to exist if there is a proper system of democratic control and accountability  just as we would expect proper democratic accountability by our own national police forces. We must respect the principle that policing can take place only with the consent of the communities being served. Police forces that see themselves as some kind of external force coming in to impose rules and operations which are not acceptable to the community at large will fail. We need good effective policing with the consent of the communities.  Finally, Mrs dAnconas report on the complex and vexed area of drugs balances very difficult issues: the question of not condoning the use of dangerous drugs but, at the same time, recognising that a purely punitive approach to this issue will never succeed and that there must be proper emphasis on education, health matters and so on. It is a good balanced approach to this issue.
9013028 author: Annette Bauer:  Mr President, I want to offer my warmest welcome to Chancellor Schroeder who is here on behalf of the German presidency. I thank him very sincerely for what I consider to be one of the finest statements I have heard in Parliament from a PresidentinOffice for a considerable period of time. I thank him for what he said in relation to the crisis in Kosovo. Parliament, by its applause, has shown its satisfaction with that statement. I would also sincerely thank him for the Berlin Resolution in this area.  I know the PresidentinOffice is having a meeting this afternoon with Heads of State and Government and it is important that during this discussion he convey to his colleagues that it is of the utmost urgency that the relief effort to help Kosovar Albanians continues and that the European Union play a leading role in the humanitarian aid mission. Financial resources must be made available to ensure that the relief programmes continue and that appropriate medicinal and food supplies reach the refugees in need.  We would have hoped that as this millennium ends we would have left the spectre of war in Europe behind us. Sadly, the totalitarian despot, Mr Milosevic, is fuelling the flames of genocide and compounding the misery of the Kosovar Albanians. I very much hold the view that there should be no escape for Mr Milosevic and that at some stage he must face the charges of war crimes in a court of law.  I have one negative point to say to Chancellor Schroeder. I believe that you are genuine in your expression of appreciation of the role of the European Parliament. But your credibility is somewhat questioned by the fact that our President, Mr GilRobles, is not invited to the meeting this afternoon. I regret that. It is a mistake that has happened somewhere along the line and even at this late stage I feel you should reconsider it. It is a bad mistake and gives a wrong signal.  I would like to say a special word of thanks and appreciation to Mr Santer for the magnificent work he has done for the European Union for the last fourandahalf years. I thank him very sincerely for what he has contributed, and also his colleagues in the Commission. I very much regret that he is the victim of circumstances at this particular time. You have my full respect, President Santer, and my appreciation for what you have done for Europe during your term of office.  The Berlin Summit of  25  March was a good summit. It achieved a lot in terms of finalising the overall financial parameters for spending within the EU for the sevenyear period after  1999 . Ever since the Agenda  2000  proposals for reform of the Union policies were first published in March  1998  it was always felt in some quarters that it would be difficult to find an agreement that was balanced and evenhanded across all the territories of the European Union. The German presidency can take solace from the fact that the spending parameters for the budget for the Union for the period  20002006  commands the confidence and the good will of all the Member States of the European Union.  The budget totals of  506 bn will put in place various programmes to lay the foundation for the impending enlargement of the European Union itself. Equally, it will ensure that the common agricultural policy will be properly financed and that many social and regional aid schemes will continue for the poorer Member States of the Union after  1999 .  I should like to deal with some aspects of the common agricultural policy for the moment. It was suggested in a document entitled The future financing of the European Union, issued by the Commission before Christmas, that possibly  25   of the CAP should be financed by the national exchequers of individual Member States. This would have been a regressive step for the European Union to have taken. It would have been a very divisive move because one of the successful aspects of the CAP is the fact that it is administered in a uniform manner across all the territories of the European Union. Renationalising part of the CAP could only have led to the ultimate disintegration and fragmentation of the common agricultural policy itself.  Finally, I should like to say to Chancellor Schroeder: you got off to a reasonably weak start in your presidency; you have made tremendous progress in recent times. There are still a lot of important items on the agenda for completion by the end of your presidency. I congratulate you on the progress you are making to date. You are twothirds of the way to the winning post. We want to see you put in greater effort between now and the end of June.

4875879 author: Helen Finlayson:  Mr President, this is a joint report by my colleague, Mr Schiedermeier, and myself. Indeed, on the subject of Italy, which we will be discussing, I remember a few years ago we went to Italy with the Social Affairs Committee. The Secretariat did not know who was doyen dage , the oldest Member. They thought it was Mr Schiedermeier because he had white hair. In actual fact, when they checked the records, I was a few weeks older than him, so it should have been me. So it was quite interesting that we were both approaching our  60 th year.  This report is the result of the conference which we held on the elderly in October. It put forward the views of the elderly citizens of the Community, what they might like to see for the future, and what kind of recommendations we would make for the United Nations Year of the Elderly. The elderly  senior citizens, or grey panthers, as they are called in the United States; grey power in the UK  represent a very important part of the Community. I see many of the golden oldies or grey oldies around me this morning: on my left, Mr Schiedermeier, on my right Mr Falconer. They have changed their usual political positions.  The conference came up with some recommendations which we have put to the Commission. The Commission is bringing forward a communication on problems of the elderly. We are not just talking about people beyond the age of retirement, we are talking about people from  60  years of age to  75 . There are  75  million people over the age of  60  in the European Union. This will increase. Demographic trends are going to create a timebomb for the decisionmakers of the future. We must be able to respond to this. Ageing is high on the EUs political agenda. I am quite sure that in the next few weeks, when our colleagues go to the hustings, they will be besieged by many of the Communitys senior citizens, asking what the European Parliament is going to do for them. Over  42   of voters in the EU are over  50  years of age. So, if we have  75  million people over the age of  60  and  42   of the voters are over  50  years of age, obviously the issues of senior citizens and the elderly are going to be important in campaigning.  The over 50 s represent  33   of the whole population of the EU; onethird of the EU is over  50 . Article  13  of the Amsterdam Treaty outlaws discrimination on the grounds of age, sex, gender, disability, sexual orientation, etc. It now gives the Commission a legal peg to introduce measures for the elderly and senior citizens. At the moment the Commission is constrained by the existing legal bases. But the Amsterdam Treaty now gives the Commission the opportunity to deal with discrimination on the grounds of race or age. We look forward to seeing what will come out of the employment guidelines which the Commission agreed at the conference in Luxembourg and some of the discussions about the European Social Fund and older workers. There are tremendous possibilities there. Fiftyone percent of all men seeking work are in the  5064  age group. There will probably be some Members, like myself, who are in a similar position after  13  June. The percentage for women is the same:  51   of women who are seeking work are in the  5064  age group.  Employment is a very serious issue for this age group. It is time that we, in the institutions, put our own house in order and deal with the ageism that we practice in some of our recruitment policies.  So what can we do about this, now having stated the problem? The Amsterdam Treaty is one area where we can do something. Health is another area. I would hope that the Commission will bring forward an action programme on health for elderly people and for the whole Community under Article  137 .  The elderly are not a homogeneous group. We must not treat them just as elderly and lock them away in a cupboard or parcel them off and say that is elderly. We must try to pull the Union and its citizens together and have genuine solidarity. We must not just limit our measures to older people themselves.  So these are some of the measures we are putting forward. I would like to thank Mr Schiedermeier for his cooperation. I thank the staff of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. As this is my swan song as rapporteur for this mandate, I must say I have enjoyed my experience this year.  Loud applause
790807 author: Amy Brown:  Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Mr Flynn, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Menrad for his report and by thanking the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its rapid work on the draft resolution. We fully share the views expressed on the European Employment Pact. In addition, Mr Menrad has stressed the need to mainstream employment in Community policies. This is fully in line with the communication adopted by the Commission on this subject on  21  April. By reiterating Parliaments support for the Luxembourg process and correctly insisting on the support which the European Social Fund must give to the European employment strategy, the report and resolution have given timely messages.  Let us be clear about what we are seeking from the European Employment Pact. As requested by the Vienna European Council such a pact should establish a dialogue involving all the actors with responsibility for designing policies which impact on economic growth and employment creation. This dialogue should fully respect the autonomy of the various actors and take place at different levels as suggested in the draft resolution before Parliament today. As regards macroeconomic policy, there should be an exchange of views between the relevant actors on each element in the macroeconomic policy mix, fiscal policy, wage trends and monetary policy, so that each can fully support the growth and employment process.  As the Amsterdam Treaty and its Article  127  enter into force, there should be an assessment of the impact of all relevant policies on employment. In our recent communication on this issue, the Commission outlined how a range of policies can promote a high level of employment and how policies are increasingly being directed towards this objective. The Communication deals, for example, with ways of encouraging and supporting investment in capital and human resources in order to strengthen the European Union economy. It examines how structural reforms can make markets work better and thus help achieve sustainable growth and employment. It refers to the modernisation of social protection and of taxation systems in order to improve work incentives and opportunities for entering or returning to the labour market. We are pleased to find that all these points are referred to in the draft resolution.  Further practical steps will be needed to assess how the various Community policies can contribute more to the employment objective and, where necessary, be refocused to ensure that they do just that. It is vital that the Employment Pact should consolidate the key role of the Luxembourg process. What is important now is to strengthen the employment guidelines so that they deliver their full potential as a powerful instrument for labour market reform. We have the right to expect that the national action plans presently being drafted by the Member States will be more ambitious than last year. And as we come to evaluate the impact of the national action plans later this year, two years after Luxembourg, we will be in a better position to assess whether the strategy is working or whether more effort is required in certain areas.  You are right to stress that the European Social Fund must play a key role in support of the European employment strategy. We understand therefore very well why the draft resolution suggests a return to the Commissions proposal for the funding of Objective  3  activities in  20002006 . However, we cannot forget the broader budgetary context. We are not unhappy with the way in which the European Social Fund and the employment strategy have been treated in the Berlin settlement.  Let me now turn to your discussion on the link between the employment guidelines and the broad economic policy guidelines. In Vienna the European Council called for greater synergy between the two processes and the Commission responded to this request with its latest broad economic policy guidelines and its Article  127  communication. However, do not forget that the Luxembourg process is still very new. The Member States have created new working arrangements to implement their national action plans and to report on them. We are learning together to work a process of peer pressure and open evaluation. It should be allowed to gain momentum: a change in timetable at this early stage could be disruptive.  It is clear that our approach to employment must cover macroeconomic, as well as microeconomic, policies and must address problems which arise not just in labour markets but also in the product and capital markets. The creation of such a comprehensive approach and a dialogue between all the actors involved is the core of the proposed employment pact. These are issues of substance not timetabling. We hope the pact will be a step towards a better integration of macroeconomic, employment and structural policies.  I should like to conclude with two or three remarks on points which I found particularly interesting in the course of the debate. Several speakers  such as Mr Blokland and Mr Langen  drew attention to the ageing population problem. Under Commissioner Flynns initiatives, the Commission has looked into the problem of the future of social security and, I am glad to say that, at the further and recent instigation of both the German presidency and the European Parliament, we will come forward very soon with a communication on pension funds, drawing the conclusions from the Green Paper exercise.  A number of speakers  including Mrs RandzioPlath, Mrs BoogerdQuaak and Mrs Van Lancker  touched upon the taxation aspects. Let me simply say that in spite of the inevitable difficulties due to the unanimity rule, it is undeniable that now, under the strong urging of the German presidency and with the support of this Parliament, progress is being made in the implementation of the strategy against harmful tax competition and a number of objectives have been set for the Helsinki European Council.  As far as the more specific proposal, dear to many of you, about the reduced VAT rate on labourintensive services is concerned, I am glad to note that today under the German presidency the first meeting of a Council working group on this subject took place, and later this evening we shall be debating the Thyssen report on this very topic.  Lastly, Mr Blot, I do not share your fear that fiscal coordination, following monetary union, might eliminate one of the two remaining options for implementing a policy against the famous asymmetric shocks. I think you can rest assured since the notion of fiscal harmonisation, as proposed by the Commission and unanimously adopted by the Ecofin Council and as supported, among others, by the rapporteur, Mr Fourans, is certainly not an advanced notion of harmonisation. I would instead call on you to consider the problem in the following terms: if there were no coordination of fiscal policies, given the present level of market integration, the Member States would increasingly lose their sovereignty to anonymous markets and they would therefore have less and less opportunities to implement an effective fiscal policy.
8784891 author: Sarah Green:  Mr President, I and the House have listened extremely carefully this morning to Mr Prodis opening statement. I thank him very much for the thoughtful and intelligent approach he took to the opening of this debate. That we are here today looking at the ratification of a new President of the Commission, six months before it was due according to the timetable, is a reflection of the changing roles and expectations of the European Union.  We have seen the EU dealing in areas and working on issues which now affect the lives of the citizens of the European Union in a very direct way: the launching of the euro, soon not to be just a tool for banks and institutions but also the coins and notes in the pockets of our citizens and, this week, the coming into being of the Amsterdam Treaty with its changing emphasis towards policies that affect people and in particular job creation. When you are talking about jobs and the money in peoples pockets, you are talking about issues that very clearly affect the lives of every citizen of the European Union.  It is no coincidence therefore that there has been a greater concentration on the systems of governance in the European Union. These systems were found wanting and they have failed in the last few weeks. We need to see demonstrable change. The next Commission must reflect a new approach to structure and responsibility, not for the sake of form. We are not just looking for a Commission that looks different or pays lip service to difference. We want a European Commission that is different and will deliver policies for people.  We expect that Commission to be different, to reflect the real work to be done. If I may say so, we do not want a Commission with structures and portfolios that simply reflect a division of the spoils between twenty Commissioners for whom the President must find a role and must find a job in order to make them look as if they are all important. We want a serious attempt to create a dynamic approach to delivering policies for the people of the Union.  After today, Mr Prodi, you and what you will do will be scrutinised as never before. What appointments you make to your office, the multinational nature or flavour or otherwise of your staff, the gender balance, all these will assume an importance quite disproportionate to their actual significance. Your ability to demonstrate that you have had a role that befits the President of the Commission in deciding who should be in your Commission and what their portfolios should be  all these things will give your presidency and your Commission its opening strengths and, indeed, could well give them its opening weaknesses.  I was glad that today you concentrated very much on the broader approach to your political thinking and programme for the European Union. In your last intervention in this House  which we all recognised was a very preliminary one, indeed you said so yourself  you made a largely economic presentation. Today you have looked at a much broader scope of policies with which you will be seeking to deal. We have had a flavour of some of your ideas, for instance on foreign and security policy, on home and justice affairs. I very much welcome your thinking in these areas.  Your emphasis on the competence of Commissioners and their ability and willingness to act as a team is very much to be welcomed. Your emphasis on structuring the portfolios on the basis of delivering policies and your undertaking on transparency and openness are also very welcome. Of course I do not need to say that we have had such commitments before but we take you at your word that you are serious about these.  I have a criticism and I would appreciate your comments in your concluding statement. Your speech today talked very little of people. You mentioned employment but you did not talk much about the need for the fight against social exclusion, the struggle for a fair and just Europe for all our citizens, the need to support Member States in the eradication of poverty, in particular amongst the young and the old in our societies, the need for equal opportunities for men and women, for black and white citizens of the European Union.  Mr Prodi, your humanity was clear in your speech. Your commitment to peace on this continent is to be commended. I would have liked to hear a bit more about your belief in a multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural Europe. I hope you can reassure us of this in your conclusion. By way of conclusion, for me, as a Londoner, this weekend the importance of support for a Europe of fairness and justice for all our citizens, the need for us to be committed to the fight against intolerance, racism and hatred, against those concepts, was brought very graphically and tragically to our minds.  This European Union is about a vision for the future. The big issue for our continent, for our economy, is also about people. If you are able to combine these elements successfully with a new Commission structure and ethos, you will have our support.  Applause
4759902 author: Helen Brown:  I should like first of all to thank Mr Prodi for elaborating today at much greater length on a number of the priorities which he wishes to emphasise for the next Commission. The full definition of the Prodi project properly should await the new parliamentary mandate and the nomination of the new Commission.  I wish however today to make some remarks on the policy side arising from what Mr Prodi has said. I take note of that fact that as he talked about Europes profile in the world he referred to enlargement and mentioned that enlargement will move the epicentre of the European Union towards the east. I would like, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, to place a somewhat greater emphasis on the urgency of achieving as early as possible an enlargement towards the east.  May I say to Mr Prodi that some weeks ago at a Liberal International Congress in Brussels we were addressed by the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Viktor Orban. He reminded us of the words of another politician from Eastern Europe, saying that since  1989  they have been told in Central and Eastern Europe that enlargement is always just five years away. We must draw a line under that and we must make sure that during the lifetime of the next Parliament and during the mandate of the Prodi Commission we actually bring about the reality of the first enlargement to the East. For my group that would be a serious and significant priority.  To do that of course requires greater urgency in modernising the democracy of the Union. That greater urgency has been recognised in the Council suggestion that we should have an intergovernmental conference beginning next year, something which we subscribe to. I would like to say to Mr Prodi that we, in our group, believe that as part of his European vocation for a new millennium and for the new enlarged Europe  he should perhaps reflect on the desirability of introducing into the debate the concept of a constitution for Europe. The aim here is not to finalise a project which is always evolving, but to help clarify for citizens in a meaningful way the whole complex of the documents we have produced in treaty form, the kinds of priorities that we have for the Union and the limits  because some of course also worry about the excesses of the Union. I certainly would commend to you that you examine the question of bringing forward as part of your project a constitution for Europe in the new millennium.  In respect of the formation of the Commission itself, I should say that you have my groups full support. As you leave this House to go to the various capitals and form the Commission, we have a number of priorities we would like to see in respect of balance. It has been mentioned before that we expect to see gender balance. I would also emphasise that we expect to see political balance, that is a balance of political philosophies and views and also a certain balance that reflects the role of the main political forces in this Parliament. This is important.  You said here today that you intend to have more team work. That is essential. One of your chosen mechanisms to achieve enhanced coordination will be through the Commission VicePresidents.You have not said how many vicepresidents you anticipate. Perhaps you could be more specific or perhaps that is premature, but I would say this to you, the greater the number of vicepresidents, the greater the onus to ensure for the sake of balance that some would come from smaller States.  I do not wish, Mr Prodi, to anticipate the hearings of Parliament but I do have a question: in the event that Parliament decided that one ro more of the nominee Commissioners was not acceptable, what would you propose to do, given the powers you have under the Treaty of Amsterdam? We urge you, both in choice of your Commissioners and in such an eventuality, to use your fullest powers under that Treaty and to demonstrate that indeed you are your own man.  In the time that remains to me I should like to turn to Mr Verheugen and to the Council. If I understood correctly, Mr Verheugen, you urged us to complete this procedure of nominating and putting in place the new Commission by the end of July. I respect politically why you say that but it shows scant regard and little understanding for the due process in this Parliament. I want to treat this with urgency but also with due gravity and it would turn this House into a rubber stamp and nothing more if we were rushed into it prematurely by the end of July. Worse than that, if we got it wrong in July, we might want a second bite of the cherry next January and act more vigorously then than need be.  Let us get right rather than get it early. If there is a problem now with an interim Commission that has lost its moral and political authority to act, the problem arises, in my view, because of the failure of the Council to listen to Parliament and to appoint an effective interim Commission. That is not a failure of this House. It is a failure of the Council.
3387883 author: Victor MacLeod:  Mr President, all parliamentary systems delegate implementing measures to the executive. They do not immerse themselves in too much detail. But what is peculiar about the European Unions system is that during all those years when the Council alone acted as the legislative authority, it was willing to delegate implementing measures to the Commission only on condition that a committee of national civil servants would work with the Commission.  We had three objections to such a system. Firstly, there were so many committees set up with so many different procedures with nobody quite sure who sat on which that there was a major problem of transparency.  Secondly, these committees set up by the Council or the Member States had the right to block an implementing measure from the Commission and refer them back, but Parliament had no such right. This was only possible for Council committees, not Parliaments.  Thirdly, if a measure was blocked and referred back to the legislative authority, it was referred to Council alone, not Parliament and Council jointly, even though they jointly constitute the legislative authority. That we have found unacceptable.  With codecision, though, it is now Parliament and Council jointly and equally which will decide on what measures to confer upon the Commission and what procedures will be adopted. We will use that power, Mr President  and I warn the Council that we are determined to use that power  to ensure firstly that there is openness and transparency (and I welcome the progress that has been made in that respect in the Council working group), but secondly to ensure that there is equality between Parliament and Council. In other words, if Council committees have the right to block the Commission and refer a measure back then Parliament should also have that right. And if a measure is referred back to the legislative authority it should be referred to both branches of the legislative authority, not just to one branch.  There are some who claim that Parliament wishes to immerse itself in the detail of implementing measures. That is far from being the case: this is in the nature of a safeguard, the right to blow the whistle occasionally where you think that things may be going wrong. That is a right that exists in many national parliaments,  not in all of them, national systems differ on this, but it is one that should apply at the European Union level.  If you look at the way we have used this power in the informal procedures that already exist, it is actually very unusual for parliaments to intervene and to blow the whistle. We have done it occasionally  infant formulae milk is a notable example. We blew the whistle, the Commission entered into a dialogue with us, changed its proposal and that was ultimately what was adopted. It worked. But it is very unusual. We do not want to do it very often, but we want the right to intervene when necessary. If we have that right then we will be much more willing to delegate more measures, knowing that we have that safeguard in place. But if we do not have that right, then we will be very reticent to adopt fargoing implementing provisions. We will want to hold it back in the legislative procedures. We will not want to delegate. I warn the Council that although it has made progress on transparency, if the working group continues to be so restrictive on Parliaments rights to intervene, then there will be no agreement and we will continue in legislative procedure after legislative procedure to block the comitology measures and resist the adoption of such restrictive measures and we will be very restrictive on voting the budgets and the credits to allow comitologytype committees to continue to meet.  We are not seeking to take powers to ourselves to intervene in the detail but we are seeking to have the safeguard. That safeguard is very important. It is the principle on which we will insist and unless agreement is reached in this matter I can tell Council that codecision procedure after codecision procedure will have to go all the way to conciliation and time after time there will be difficulty on this problem.  I invite Council to take the last few steps to reach an agreement with us on this.
8320065 author: Michael Merx:  The EU FBI telecommunications surveillance system is developing rapidly through two separate but very linked initiatives. First, the Council has proposed a new draft Council resolution to extend the  1995  requirements resolution to cover new technologies, the Internet and satellitebased telecommunications. And, second, the Council is on the verge of agreeing a formula to provide a legal base for remote access to a satellite ground station in Italy through a new clause in the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.  This draft convention will provide the legal framework for the interception of all forms of telecommunications in the EU which is required to put into effect the EU FBI surveillance system. Both measures are expected to be agreed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on  27  to  28  May.  What we are discussing here today, in the version discussed in the European Parliament, amends the  1995  requirements to include data on Internet users such as IP address, electronic address assigned to a party, account number and email address (ENFOPOL  1095198  REV 2 ).  That has actually been changed. What we are discussing now is not the actual wording, because what it says instead is: IP address and instead of account number it says credit card number and email address.  It is very disturbing that an issue like this is being discussed on a Thursday evening when there are very few people here, the vote will be tomorrow morning, and there has been no proper debate within national parliaments on this issue. There has definitely been no debate within the Irish Parliament and I do not think there has been debate within many of the other parliaments.  If it is possible to monitor communications in such a manner you will be able to tell where a person is, when they are there, what sites they are consulting, what electronic messages they are sending, what electronic payments they are making, basically you will know everything about a persons private life.  The Greens believe that this is a serious attack on privacy and there are not sufficient safeguards regarding data protection and democratic control. This is something that was actually brought up by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which was very critical of this. It is unfortunate that the draftsperson of the opinion is not here because it is extremely important that this point is stressed.  Rules on telephone tapping are controlled, for example, at national level. That follows very proper procedures and authorisation. This proposal here basically ignores the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the provision on the protection of private life in Article  8 . These are being overwritten here and interference by a public authority should be subject to extremely strict conditions. The view of the Committee on Legal Affairs should be taken on board.  The other point I wanted to make is that this whole issue was discussed in a procedure which was a written procedure, not in a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. This issue has not, as far as I am concerned, followed the proper democratic procedures. It has not been discussed in national parliaments. I also feel it is very sinister that this issue is put on the agenda on the Thursday night when everyone is going back to campaign for the election. There is absolutely nobody here to listen to what is going on. This is a grave step against peoples right to privacy and right to freedom.  It has always been the case in Member States throughout the European Union and right around the world that oppressive legislation is brought in using the argument that we have to combat serious crime. For example one of the speakers mentioned paedophilia and things like that on the Internet. That does not mean that you overwrite peoples basic right to privacy. That is what is going on here. There needs to be a lot more debate about this, not just here in the European Parliament but in national parliaments. I would like to know why these issues have been railroaded through in such a fashion without proper democratic control and proper public debate.
7738709 author: Roger Smith:  I should like to congratulate the Committee on Culture, and in particular its rapporteur, Mr Hoppenstedt, for this comprehensive report on Expo  2000  Hannover. In the year  2000 , Expo  2000  Hannover will be a major communication event on a world scale. The theme for the exhibition is mankind, nature and technology. The organisers, under the leadership of the Expo Commissioner General, are committed to presenting current and future options on how to achieve a balanced and harmonious coexistence of the themes three elements.  It is the Commissions intention to ensure the participation of the European Union and its institutions at this important event. This was also outlined in our communication of  18  March. We are pleased to see that all EU Member States will participate in this event. The vast majority will have their pavilions located on the socalled European boulevard. The EU pavilion would be at the heart of this, just opposite the host countrys pavilion.  The aim of Union participation at Expo  2000  is to present the crucial role the European Union is playing, through its institutions, as a forwardlooking, dynamic actor on the world stage at the dawn of the  21 st century.  The Commission is pleased to note that Mr Hoppenstedts report gives positive backing to the Commissions intention to organise Union participation at Expo  2000 . The report specifically underlines the importance of a coherent and balanced presentation within the Union pavilion.  The Commission agrees with Mr Hoppenstedt that the Union pavilion must present the best possible image of the European Union in the  21 st century: a European Union which is democratic, transparent, lawabiding, socially just, tolerant and culturally diverse. What we strive for is to make its citizens aware of the reality of European integration and of the Unions role in international relations.  It is our aim that such a presentation will be based on the use of the latest interactive multimedia and electronic technology available. This will ensure that visitors, and in particular the younger generation, will have an eyecatching and thoughtprovoking experience.  I am pleased to inform you that an architects competition for the design of the Unions pavilion has now been judged. Its results are due to be announced formally in the EC Official Journal. The companies involved in the competition have also been informed directly. The Commission is responsible for the official coordination of all EU institutions to ensure they participate in a coherent manner in Expo.  I can report to you that such coordination has already begun. The Commissions interservice task force, and an interinstitutional working party have been created. The detailed programme of activities and communication strategies is being developed within these two bodies along the lines of the Commissions communication and the Culture Committees report. Regular reports on the progress of this work will be made to the Culture Committee.  With regard to the budget, an estimated amount of EUR  14  m is proposed for the year  19992000  on budget line B 3309 , Special Annual Events. This budget, which will cover the needs of all EU institutions, is deemed the minimum necessary to finance the proper participation of the Union at the Expo. It will be recalled that a total of EUR  10  m was earmarked on budget line B 330999  in order to finance two activities: Expo  2000  and a European campaign to combat violence against women. In addition to this it is strongly recommended that a further EUR  6 . 5  m is voted for in the budget for the next year, the year  2000 , to complete the Expo  2000  action.  The Commission is confident that the interinstitutional cooperation already set in place will produce the necessary positive results to allow the budgetary authority to determine favourably the budget for  2000 . The Commission also welcomes the proposal to second Parliament staff to work at Expo  2000 . This will be in addition to the Commission staff that will be devoted to this action. The estimated administrative expenditure for this participation is EUR  1 . 44  m on part (A) of the budget.  The Commission looks forward to continuing cooperation with the European Parliament and its services to ensure that the Unions participation at Expo  2000  will be an important event in bringing the European Union and its institutions closer to its citizens.
2843212 author: Helen Merx:  Mr President, it is right that this Parliament and indeed the Council and the Commission treat this matter with the utmost seriousness. It really is most reprehensible that there has been not only an apparent flouting of the formal rules for Commissioners, but also a contravention of the spirit of transparency and trust that should be the basis of the work between this Parliament and Commissioners.  I have been the rapporteur on a substantial number of Directives concerning the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry and I, and my colleagues, have acted in good faith in this work and had assumed that the former Commissioner Bangemann had done the same. One can only speculate at just how much of a commitment Mr Bangemann had to the level playing field in this aspect of the internal market when he is willing to sell his knowledge to Telefnica , a major player in the European Union and further afield.  It is particularly difficult, Colleagues, when Mr Bangemann was a former Member of this Parliament and indeed, a leader of the Liberal Group.  One matter which has not been mentioned in the debate is that there is to be a major review of all of the telecommunications legislation later this year and part of this work has already been started by the Commission under Mr Bangemanns commissionership.  As I have previously stated, I have been the rapporteur on a number of matters, but if I can just give you a thumbnail sketch of just how extensive this review will be and what it will cover  universal service, frequencies, satellite, regulation, licences, interconnections, numbering, mobile telephones, convergence of broadcasting, data transmission and telecommunications  an explosion of legislation and an enormous segment of the European Unions manufacturing, industrial and commercial base in its own right, but also as an adjunct to so many other industries. On all of this, Mr Bangemann takes with him his knowledge and his contacts to Telefnica .  There are also a worryingly substantial number of cases before the European Court of Justice on breaches of legislation, particularly in the field of interconnections  again, matters on which the former Commissioner has intimate knowledge. The Commissioner, when he was here in this Chamber, and I have had many debates with him, was fond of quoting from Shakespeare and other English poets. I shall quote one in his absence on his behalf  Just for a handful of silver he left us, just for a ribbon to stick on his coat. I know that the money he has been offered by Telefnica hardly can be justified by the description of a handful of silver and indeed it begs the question of just how seriously Members of this House will treat a company like Telefnica when it comes to lobby us as they surely will on the matter of the review and future legislation in this field.  If I can be slightly mischievous, one wonders just how much value for money Telefnica will get out of Martin Bangemann. I wish he were on a performancerelated pay and he might find that the fat cheque might not look nearly so attractive.  I understand Commissioner Kinnocks hesitation and his hesitations because this matter is sub judice . Fortunately, Members of this Parliament are protected by parliamentary privilege, but even then, Commissioner Kinnock, I would ask you to note the reasonably restrained language that there is in our resolution and if I may just quote to you briefly on what the resolution says  it deems his conduct to be particularly open to criticism . We did choose the language very carefully and many might say that open to criticism might be a serious understatement.  I finish, where I started, by saying that we are right to treat this with the utmost seriousness. I support absolutely the Councils decision to refer this matter to the Court and to use all the powers that there are under the agreements.  However, one matter still is outstanding. There seems to be no mechanism within the existing rules and obligations where a company like Telefnica itself can be subject to some sort of punitive measures. If we could find some way not only of having a measure to take against former Commissioners who act in this way, but also against the companies who benefit from their knowledge, then I think that we might have two very powerful levers to use in future transgressions.  We hope, of course, that these will not occur. We wish the new Commission every success and hope that the high standards they espouse will be put into practice.
5492335 author: Nancy Bauer:  I should like to begin by responding to the words of MaijWeggen. The point is well made and well taken. I know that she feels strongly about this and that she is not alone in that.  Whilst I obviously cannot commit my colleague, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, who is happily a Member of this House at the present time, to the development of her policy and approach in this House, there are several who feel that the time is right for further discussion between the Commission and Parliament on some of the procedures and conventions of this House, which obviously meets in more than one place, as well as the conventions and procedures of the College. I hope that discussion can proceed without great delay because there could be developments which would be of mutual benefit and would actually promote accountability and transparency in the service of the Union.  On the question before the House, I would like to make the following statement on behalf of the Commission. This week, the Commission issued a formal legal decision against the local organisers of last years football World Cup tournament in France. The organisers were the CFO. That decision followed the organisations use of discriminatory sales arrangements for tickets for matches.  As the House will recall, in  1996  and  1997  the system used by CFO favoured consumers who were able to provide an address in France. In the view of the Commission, that constituted an abuse of the organisations dominant position in the market which is contrary to Article  82  of the Treaty. This was the first case in Community history in which Article  82  of the Treaty has been used to penalise a discriminatory practice that harms the interests of consumers without having a significant effect on the market. In reaching its decision therefore, the Commission took account of the fact that there were no previous decisions of the Commission or caselaw from the Court of Justice to guide CFO in its ticketing policy. In addition it was evident that the ticketing arrangements used by CFO in  1996  and  1997  were exactly similar to those employed in previous World Cup tournaments and other similar major international contests.  As the House will recall, the Commission responded to complaints from people outside France who were finding it impossible to buy tickets by beginning an investigation. The CFO then quickly changed its policy and made efforts to make sure that tickets sold in  1998  were available without discrimination. Then  100 ,  000  tickets became available to everyone on a firstcomefirstserved basis.  The Commission judged that these factors  the unprecedented application of the law, the conventions relating to previous ticket sales for international tournaments, and the constructive action of CFO  justified a symbolic rather than a punitive fine. In addition, it is relevant to add that a more substantial fine on the organisers of the  1998  World Cup in France would have imposed an obligation on the Commission to consider action against the organisers of previous major tournaments who used exactly the same ticketing policies. This could have meant, for example, action against the organisers of the  1996  European Championship because on that occasion, supporters benefitted from a sales scheme which favoured nationals over fans from abroad.  The French organising committee is not a normal commercial profitseeking company. It exists for the interests of football and it is important to recognise that all profits reverted to the game of football. Fining the French organising committee means taking money away from grassroots football and from the promotion of the game and putting that money into the coffers of the European Commission. I do not believe that any genuine lover of football would think that was either sensible or acceptable.  I know that football supporters in parts of the Union have strongly criticised the size of the EUR  1 ,  000  fine. My colleagues and I can certainly understand such reactions when those reactions are not informed by the facts. I hope, however, that in this House and elsewhere, there will be recognition of the specific factors directly relevant to this case. The important  and I think the instructive  outcome of the case is plain. All future sports tournament organisers now clearly know that any ticketing arrangements must comply fully with European Community competition rules and be nondiscriminatory. Secondly, they know that the Commission will not hesitate to take action against any organiser that fails to comply with those rules. Thirdly, they know that the symbolic approach could only be followed once, and in very particular circumstances.  These realities, in the view of the Commission, mean that standards of fair treatment for sports fans have been clarified and strengthened. They will definitely enjoy protection against discrimination in the future. The organisers of the Euro 2000  Cup in Belgium and the Netherlands have, for instance, contacted the Commission and as a result, they have adapted their sales system to meet the requirements of Community law. There has been no previous occasion on which a higher percentage of tickets has been made available to the general public with absolutely equal rights for all citizens of the European Union. We intend to keep it that way.  That is the silver lining. It is a pity that first there had to be a cloud.
3694631 author: Frederic MacLeod:  . Mr President, I am very grateful for the opportunity which this House has provided for comment by the Commission in this debate. The report of the Committee of Independent Experts is obviously large in size and scope and significance, and I know that at this stage Parliament will not seek detailed references to every one of the many comments and valid conclusions. The House will be right, however, to expect effective Commission responses to the recommendations of the committee as we proceed with reform. In this case, as in many others, deeds speak louder than words. As far as I am concerned, and as far as the President and Commissiondesignate are concerned, that is a maxim and a reality that will shape the reforming mission of the Commission from the outset, if that is the decision of the vote in this House on Wednesday.  Mr President, the Committee of Independent Experts has provided us with a comprehensive and constructive report which shows impressive insight and makes practical proposals for progress that is deep, broad and indeed essential. Its diagnosis is of an institution overtaken by, and to some extent overwhelmed by, increases and shifts in demands which over the years should have been met by new standards and methods of management, of practice and of openness, but were not met by those means. The report says that everything outside the Commission changed, whilst it remained largely untouched. The past ruled, conventions paralysed.  Of course a diagnosis is not an excuse, it is at best an explanation which provides the basis for remedy. That is how the report is received in the Commission, the current Commission which has days to live, and the Commissiondesignate. It must be used by the Commission and, as the committee emphasises, by Member States and by this House as a charter for change, a prescription for cure. That is the essential validity of this report from the Committee of Independent Experts.  As the committee acknowledges in several references, some of the changes needed have taken place and some are in prospect. That recognition is very encouraging. It demonstrates a clear alignment between the recommendations of the committee and the reforms that have been undertaken and the reforms that are impending. There is however no lasting comfort to be taken from that. To the great frustration of those in the Commission and those in this House who have promoted reform, and as we have just heard from Mr Dell Alba, the advances made so far have been sporadic and not conceived and not implemented as a managed programme of change.  Reform has therefore not gone far enough, fast enough or deep enough. It has been approached in a way that has meant it has not been offered or pursued with the explanation and the reorientation necessary to gain an understanding of purposes and of outcomes. It has therefore not motivated the will of the many highquality people which, as the report says on several occasions, are in the Commission services. Even those who are interested in and committed to change have not been imbued with a sense of urgency or, crucially, Mr President, a feeling of ownership of reform. The cumulative efforts to modernise have therefore not been strong enough to replace an outdated and deficient culture with the practices and instincts of what is generally termed new public management as it has developed over the last  20  years in several other modern administrations. That must change  and it will change.  Mr President, I heed and I fully understand the view of the committee in its final remarks that no single measure can deal with the problem of mentality, but I do believe that a clear and comprehensive reform strategy, effective mechanisms for vigorously assessing and insisting upon the achievement of objectives, quality of public service and value for money, vocational training in the techniques and ethics of management, strictly meritocratic promotion, fair, firm and trustworthy disciplinary procedures, continual emphasis on professionalism and probity in the college and in the services can mould mentality. That is not a wishlist. It is an outline of the changes that will be designed, the changes that will be put into effect.  In undertaking those tasks we have the advantage of the commitment of the many people in the Commission services who, as the committee says, sincerely want to contribute to radical improvement. The reform effort can therefore be with the grain of the attitudes of a large number of the Commission staff at all levels from the most senior to the most recently arrived. Some may not yet share the broad desire for improvement, however. They would be well advised to recognise the weight of political and public opinion that propels the change and has given rise to the circumstances that now starkly confront the institution that I represent and indeed all of the European institutions. I also trust that those who may fear reform as a source of insecurity, of disturbance will, on reflection, come to understand that change is the path to security. It is institutions, administrations, companies which fail to anticipate and to respond productively to new demands that doom themselves and the people who work for them to insecurity and the turmoil that comes with it.  Against the background of all these considerations and the statements that we have heard from political leaders in this House today, I offer on behalf of the Commissiondesignate the pledge that the report will be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission s reform proposals. The February reform strategy will therefore address all of the issues raised, propose the relevant action and set out the means of taking that action.  I equally give the undertaking that the complete overhaul of the Commission s financial management and control systems will be intensified, taking full account of the specific recommendations of the Committee on all matters including those raised by those who have so far spoken in the debate on subsidies and much else. In particular, the Commission pledges to move systematically from the traditional dependence on exante financial control to an integrated system of financial management and auditing in which the responsibilities of individual officers are clearly defined, monitored and reinforced.  In the same spirit, the Commission will respond to the report by setting up an internal audit service, as recommended by the committee, and we reiterate our commitment to the strengthening of financial cells in all directoratesgeneral. As an immediate development, the control of technical assistance organisations is being made more rigorous and specific, and radical reform will ensure clear definition of the core public service functions of Commission officials and effectively supervised and accountable management of executive agencies. A complete overhaul of personnel policy will take place and it will focus in particular on the areas of weakness identified in the report and elsewhere including the Commission s own stringent report, notably recruitment, discipline and career development and training.  The Committee of Independent Experts advanced the arguments for establishing a committee on standards of public life at European level. The House will know that the Council and this Parliament, as well as the Commission, will obviously have to deliberate on that. As an individual however, I must say that I believe that the functions set out by the committee should be fulfilled either by an existing suitable body or by a new organisation. I hope therefore that all the European institutions will be willing to proceed on that basis. I am certain that the Committee of Wise Men is not exercised by the name of such a body. It is the fulfilment of the functions relating to public standards that is really required.  The Commission of the future must be an independent, permanent and capable public service that puts the principles of accountability, efficiency and transparency to work at all times. The values sustaining the institution should moreover be centred on an ethos of good management, value for money, clear communication, merit and duty to the citizens and taxpayers of the European Union. My colleagues and I share strong commitment to those purposes and to the practical changes need to achieve them. We do not promise instant gains. We do promise unceasing effort. We shall get the advances which the people of the Union deserve and the people of the Union have the right to expect. Given the chance by the vote of this Parliament, we will show that, not in our words but in our deeds.
3426698 author: Sarah McNabb:  , Commission. I am sure you will join me in regretting that there are many more questions than there are Members in the House. Indeed, even after four and a half years, I am constantly struck by cultural shock since at Westminster, unlike in this Parliament, to speak in the debate is to impose an automatic requirement to sit in that debate throughout and never to depart unless and until permission of the Chair is given, the understanding of fellow Members in the House is received or business is so pressing as in fact to forbid you from participating in the debate in the first place. Nevertheless there are differing traditions throughout this democratic association of Member States and I respect all of them.  Can I begin by taking issue with one tiny point put forward by my very good friend, Mr Colom I Naval who said that he hoped that this was a full stop to an unhappy episode in the history of the Union. I can certainly sympathise with his sentiment, but I rather regard the publication of the second report of the Committee of Wise Men as more of a stage in necessary progress than any sort of a finishing line. I am sure on reflection that will be the view of a large number of Members of this House.  Can I also say to Mr Schori that I congratulate him on his maiden speech. As he has discovered, on previous occasions, politics is about the only profession in which it is possible to be a maiden more than once! It is difficult to think of Mr Schori as a maiden of any description after his very long and distinguished career in democratic politics over many years. I firmly underline and endorse his view that he hopes that we are at the beginning of the kind of reforms the people want. I am certain that he, throughout his parliamentary career here, will as on previous occasions be vigilant in ensuring that we try to achieve those objectives.  Mrs Theato who is not with us at this juncture, but nevertheless made important points, as she invariably does, raised the question relating to this Parliament getting access to documents that were given as part of evidence to the Committee of Wise Men. I can only say what I said in answer to my written answers to the questionnaire and repeated last week that transparency should be maximised. It is important, however, to respect the right of individuals who give evidence in confidence, and confidentiality must therefore be observed where necessary. I consequently believe that the Commission and Parliament should work together to ensure that these dual objectives  transparency and the need to honour undertakings given to individuals who gave their evidence in confidence  are met in deciding on the final destination of the complete archives and on rules relating to access to those archives in a secure environment.  I hope I can say conclusively that in all the words I have used, both in that written reply and last week in the hearings, there is no intention of trying to obscure or to evade the full requirements of transparency. I do not think I can say it any more clearly and strongly than that, and if any misunderstanding persists, I will do everything I can to completely remove it. We are in agreement about the objectives. I am certain that nobody in Parliament would want to fail to honour commitments given to people who gave evidence on the understanding that they would enjoy confidentiality; but in all other respects, if we can agree on a workable means of ensuring the proper depositing of that evidence with the agreement of the Committee of Wise Men, then I am sure we should do it. I hope that will be very clear.  Can I now move to this question of a European Public Prosecutor s Office that has been suggested, not for the first time. Indeed, it was first suggested by this Parliament. All I can say is that we can only speculate about the response of Member States on that proposal. However, without going into the immense complications that will attend any further developments in a manner suggested by the Committee of Wise Men, I should like to say that crime is increasingly internationalised. All efforts to fight crime equally have to be internationalised and, whatever else happens, there has to be improved coordination and cooperation between the judicial and other relevant bodies of this European Union. I am certain that no responsible person, certainly no elected representative or Member of the Commission, would want it otherwise. I look forward to the continuation of the debate launched in many ways by reports from this Parliament. I am absolutely certain that if we understand that we all have this shared purpose in combating and deterring fraud, we shall want to maximise the means of doing that by any rational means available to our democracies.  Can I say to several Members, including particularly Mrs Morgan who has just spoken and Mrs Van der Laan who explained to me why she had to be absent from this part of the debate, that the Committee of Wise Men is extremely explicit about the way in which there has to be a joint and cooperative approach by Member States, by this House and by the Commission in securing the extent and depth of reform which this European Union in its fourth decade must achieve. It was said indeed during the debate that we should try to ensure that we get that kind of association as a precondition for successful change. I understand and completely accept that as a basic purpose but I have to say that there are changes that we must secure in the Commission, the executive administration of the Union, that simply will not wait for what by definition will be a prolonged and very thorough activity.  I am sure that Parliament will excuse us if we make some innovative departures by ourselves.  If I can come very quickly  because I do not want to detain the House for too long and I am conscious of the fact that this is the second speech that I was invited to make by the Parliament  to this question of Recommendation  36  and Commissioner s responsibility. I am grateful to Mr Lagendijk for the way in which he raised the question, not only because he was right to draw our attention to the provisions of Recommendation  36 , which I happen to agree with, but also because it gives me an opportunity to reply to another Member who chose to represent my references in answer to the questionnaire and the references made by some of my colleagues in the Commissiondesignate to effective management by the services in the services as somehow abdicating the responsibility of Commissioners. It is no such thing. I believe that Commissioners must have and accept overall political and managerial responsibility. But it would be absurd and inconsistent for us in one breath to be advocating the effective decentralisation of responsibility and the increase in accountability that derives from that and at the same time presuming to sit on the shoulders of every manager in the European Commission. That is not the way to enhance efficiency and accountability, it would simply be a more rigid form of centralisation that would not help anyone.  Mr Elles raised several interesting questions. I will not be able in the time available to answer all of them. I would just like to touch if I may on two. I have already touched on the question of the European public prosecutor which he raised. In trying to secure real and durable improvement in what he described as the financial control environment, he will know that there have been efforts to achieve this through more effective allocation of responsibilities and effective central coordination monitoring unnecessary control. The idea set out in the report of the Committee of Wise Men for the establishment of the internal audit service in the way that they described it represents in my view and the view of my colleagues a significant step ahead. We can I suppose be blamed for not making this change spontaneously  it is one of several recommendations in the Committee of Wise Men which we should take, which we should think about quickly and exploit to the full. I hope that we will have Parliament with us on that.  Finally, if I can simply say that on the question of whistleblowers, raised by many Members including Mr Elles, I hope that I made clear last week what my intentions are for securing change in the current system, that will ensure, if I can put it briefly, complete fairness and security for those who exercise their duty of reporting, for those who are the object of accusation and for the institution as a whole and through that the European taxpayer. We know that there are innovative systems now in existence amongst many Member States. We want to learn quickly from the best of those and seek radical reform in this area. It is a basic requirement of effective and accountable public administration. I cannot give an absolute date for the introduction of change. To some extent its full introduction will depend upon agreement between the institutions, but in terms of setting out in detail what I and my colleagues want and pursuing that with vigour, Parliament has absolute undertakings on that. The changes I want in my view cannot come quickly enough. They will work to the benefit of the whole of the Union.  I hope the House will forgive me, Mr President, if I end there. There is much more than I would like to say. Can I offer reassurance on a point that has been raised by many Members. As I said, I think in my first or second sentence this afternoon, this Commissiondesignate will, if the Parliament votes for it on Wednesday, have years of opportunity to demonstrate how seriously it takes the recommendations and indeed the admonitions of the Committee of Wise Men. We will strive to do that, to our best endeavours and in good faith. In the course of doing it we will have extensive opportunities to discuss in detail what was produced last Friday by the Committee of Wise Men. As I indicated earlier, it is not just the discussions that will be important, it is the decisions and actions following from it. In this, as in many other things, it is the verb that matters more than the noun.  (Applause)
8155419 author: Victor MacLeod:  . Mr President, I am rather disappointed that the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Bjerregaard, is not here. It is rather disappointing that the Member of the Commission responsible for this issue is not here and that someone else is here who is not responsible for this portfolio. It makes a laughingstock of the debates in this Parliament.  Marine pollution, accidental and deliberate, is one of the major threats to the marine environment of Western Europe. This region represents one of the most intensively industrialised areas of the world where chemical, radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships. The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. There are several tragic examples of accidental pollution from tankers and from other ships carrying various forms of dangerous cargoes. More by good fortune than by good planning there has not yet been a major accident resulting in radioactive spillage with a ship carrying radioactive materials although there was an incident some years back where a ship carrying uranium hydrofluoride from France to Riga sank but it is recorded that the containers apparently were recovered without any spillage.  Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping ground for much of our industrial waste. Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources, the practice of direct dumping with little thought to the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable. However, the legacy of the years where materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us, often with severe consequences. It is a lesson which tells us that when we attempt to throw things away there really is no such thing as away .  This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Furthermore there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include operational historical and radioactive and other harmful substances, accidental and operational marine pollution. Although much attention is rightly paid to the impact of marine accidents, in terms of the chronic pollution it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons, radioactive materials and other harmful substances which, because they go largely unnoticed, are a cause of major concern. In terms of the environment whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no real consequence, the environmental impact remains.  Furthermore, although the direct dumping of industrial materials, including military dumps of redundant munitions, is largely a practice which has been abandoned by Member States, the sites of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases, for example not far from my own coast, the Beaufort Dyke, a threat to human safety. Often fishermen s lives are at risk, as are the health and welfare of the public who either visit the coast or live by the sea. Furthermore, as the sea is the ultimate sink for much industrial material from the shores and rivers these sources must be included within the definition.  The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the need for a Communitywide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances carried at sea and discharges into the sea which have been dumped as part of historical dumping regimes is a vital prerequisite in facilitating the preparation and coordination of any response necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents.  Effective mitigation requires a rapid response. The longer an incident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact, as we have seen. Hence it is too late to begin trying to get the required information after a serious pollution problem has occurred. We need to take action before. Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques, personnel and equipment at appropriate locations. It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessments of the risk. The public s trust in the authorities is important to ensuring adequate responses. Furthermore, the public have a right to know what preparations are being made, what types of materials are threatening and what impacts may be expected. To this end, publication of information is a vital component as it establishes a route through which the general public can obtain information, for example emergency phone contact numbers. Such information can be easily made available and updated on the Internet as well as through established channels.  To conclude, it is a truism that once the marine environment has been contaminated or polluted it is impossible to fully clean up and repair the damage. However a rapid, efficient, adequate and effective response coordinated across national boundaries is needed to mitigate the impacts on the environment and public health in the case of a pollution incident. A prerequisite is the necessary information sharing with all parties. The database and information technology exists to establish the necessary communications between national and regional authorities, emergency response experts and the public. The dissemination of information about the range of marine pollution threats  hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances  will serve to ensure that the best possible mitigation measures are in place and have the full public trust and confidence of the public. On the issue of radioactive substances, during the debate in the committee the Commission representative said that it was implicit but we want it to be explicit. It is quite clear that it should be explicit and if it is already implied then I do not see what the problem is about ensuring that it is explicit because as time goes by radioactive substances are going to pose an even greater danger and  as I have already said  we are very lucky that there has not already been a serious accident.
3014892 author: Philip White:  Madam President, let me begin by saying on behalf of my group that we fully share the perspective of Mr Prodi that certainly from tomorrow we stand on the threshold of a new beginning; a new beginning in particular between our two institutions, Parliament and the Commission, and a new beginning for Europe itself.  On the issues which the Presidentdesignate has raised of reform, which should be brought forward by Commissioner Kinnock next February with due consultation, the policy programme of next January, the moral and political imperative of addressing the enlargement challenge and preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference, I pledge my group to a positive and constructive engagement with the Commission in this regard. Indeed we look forward to getting down to serious and immediate work on questions such as East Timor, southeastern Europe and the Balkans in particular.  But today is an opportunity for this House to review the investiture process and to place on record some of the questions or observations that arise from that. In due course, within the House and in the appropriate fora, my own group intends to contribute to a debate which we hope will be initiated on lessons which we ourselves, as Parliament, must learn from the hearings process. We certainly would hope for the future that we might be able to develop procedures to allow for what might be described as more questioning in depth of nominees. That said, however, we believe that the exercise just completed has been a positive and valuable exercise.  Some in this House  I believe from the outset that they have been a minority, though perhaps rather vocal in terms of the media  have talked of targeting individual nominees. This has not been the approach nor the view of my group. We believe that ab initio this kind of process, which, as I said, was a minority pursuit, to be a sign of weakness and not of strength.  Tomorrow, when we vote on the college, the ELDR group will vote for a college and we will not seek at this point to differentiate, to pick or to choose between nominees. We respect in the act of voting tomorrow the essential collegiality of the European Commission and regard that as an essential value for its working method. But we have some questions that arise from the hearings and some observations.  In the procedures to date, many of the nominee Commissioners were kind enough to, in effect, promise in advance a charter of reform for their own areas and have alluded to specific policy commitments. We have taken note of those commitments and we expect to see them reflected in the work programme in January. We shall check that programme against those commitments which were given in the course of the hearings.  It is obvious from the hearings  indeed without them it is obvious  that there are major areas of overlap and therefore potential conflict in operational responsibilities within the college. Here again we hope that, in working through the programme for January, where these overlaps arise they will be explicitly identified and addressed in order that potential conflicts in spheres of responsibility should not slow down the reform process.  I recall in particular questions about the overlaps between food law and food safety, the various overlaps that one can imagine with the World Trade Organisation and a host of other responsibilities, not least those of the Environment Commissioner. The President mentioned the importance of electronic commerce and information technology. These issues must clearly be addressed as to responsibility.  Many colleagues have also raised questions about the desirability of separating the ex ante responsibility for budget control from the ex post responsibility for budget implementation or formulation within the Commission. Many in my own group have raised this question with me. I raise it today but hasten to add that this is in no way a reflection on the qualities or capacity of the nominee Commissioner charged to deal with both of these issues in the current sphere of responsibilities.  There has been a certain diversity of views, Mr Prodi, among your nominee Commissioners about their personal political accountability in the future. They all accepted in the hearings that they will be responsible for themselves and their cabinets. Some did not quite accept what I believe is also a necessary requirement, that in the matter of policy formulation and implementation they carry a general responsibility for their departments, answerable to the college but accountable to this Parliament.  Specifically, my group, has for many months now raised the question of individual responsibility. Again I return to that point today. I have already said we support as necessary the collegiate nature of the Commission. However we reassert, as we have done consistently, that an effective college requires the assumption of individual political responsibility. The buck must stop somewhere. Where everyone is responsible it can result in a system where no one is responsible. We do not contest, President Prodi, your prerogative to act in this regard. But we insist that, whatever the current state of law, the law needs changing and that if a Commissioner fails to enjoy the confidence of this House you must act accordingly. We urge you to do that. It is your prerogative but it is our right to insist that the confidence of this House be respected and its absence be respected also. Indeed, here I hope you will not adopt the Stoiber formulation referred to by Mr Barn Crespo.  I should add, arising from matters raised in the hearings but not concluded, in respect of some of the individual nominee Commissioners that should any legal or criminal proceedings arise  which I do not anticipate would necessarily be the case but which would pose problems for the integrity of the Commission  we would expect the President of the Commission to act in such circumstances.  We intend to negotiate later today and tomorrow a political resolution. That will formulate and specify a number of requests, not just on the area of individual responsibility but also specifically to do with areas of transparency and access to documents. When we vote on those my group will expect to hear from you a specific detailed and positive response before our final vote.  In conclusion, we share the vision expressed here today. It is high time that we had this new beginning. It is the time for us to return to serious work. It is time that we recognise and rebuild as institutions  Commission and Parliament  our common European vocation. The ELDR group pledges itself to that task.
4522146 author: Nancy Merx:  Madam President, the Council Presidency s tour of capitals has identified three areas about which the PresidentinOffice has spoken this morning: asylum and immigration, the fight against crossborder crime and the establishment of a European judicial area. I would like to deal with each one briefly in turn.  The political challenge in asylum and immigration is striking a balance between the need to safeguard asylum as an individual right and to ensure the proper protection of refugees and the desire to resist economic migration. Europe needs a common policy on migration. At the very least we need minimum common standards. Those must be based on the  1951  Geneva Convention and on the UNHCR guidelines. We must avoid the lowest common denominator approach which would lead to a downward spiral in the level of protection. The European Union must show that it will not become a fortress, terrified of infection from without, but that it will remain a refuge for the dispossessed.  Events in recent years show us how easily situations of mass influx of refugees can come about. We need a clear message from Tampere on disentangling asylum from the debate on migration. A temporary protection regime is fine but only in exceptional circumstances and must not be one which denies the right to individual examination of asylum claims. Let us make sure that we are not moving back to asylum at political discretion but that we still regard asylum as a human right.    In the fight against crossborder crime it is clear that Europol has a role. Let us get it going. But it is only part of the solution. There are other ways to strengthen police cooperation such as the idea of a European police staff college. And there are ways to strengthen judicial cooperation. For example, some of the ideas that have been put forward under the title Eurojust , bringing prosecutors and magistrates from different countries together to prosecute crossborder crime. We need to determine the precise role, powers and financial implications of Eurojust and the issue of accountability. We need to maintain a balance between the prosecution of offences and the protection of the rights of defendants.  Much has been said about making life more difficult for the criminal but harmonising offences and penalties is an ambitious project. It has been compared to the  1992  Single Market Programme. It merits study, but let us not make the best the enemy of the good. Let us also look at progress on mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.  I would challenge you, PresidentinOffice, to define the European judicial area. It seems in matters of civil law to be about making access to justice easier. There are opportunities for concrete progress in crossborder litigation. We have already a certain degree of harmonisation: certain conventions are being worked on, for example, on driving disqualification. Much can be done on mutual recognition too. But when the European judicial area is looked at in the criminal field we are perhaps talking about operating as though there were no legal boundaries within Europe. When we deal with harmonisation of criminal law the key concept is full confidence in each other s legal systems. Here we need common minimum standards and safeguards, for example, on the treatment of suspects in custody. We need a rigorous and transparent evaluation of criminal justice systems in the Member States. We need a form of inspection and evaluation to build confidence, perhaps similar to the Schengen test on border controls. We need to invest in judicial systems such as in the training of judges and magistrates. I would commend to the Presidency the proposal for a system of Euro bail where people could be granted bail while they await trial and serve the period of bail in their home state.  In conclusion, PresidentinOffice, the scale of the agenda you have for Tampere is wide, the contributions from the Member States are many and varied. Your ideas seem not yet completely formed so you will forgive us if we are sceptical about the prospects for success. We need the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers there if we are to have real progress. We need the European Parliament involved. That means giving us full access to documentation as the debate develops. Finally, we need from Tampere a summit that will carry public opinion, that will tailor its ambitions to the human and financial resources available but will give us guidelines to demonstrate the relevance of the area of freedom, security and justice to ordinary people  (Applause)
8858182 author: Annette Reid:  . I am delighted at this early opportunity to which you refer to discuss this extremely important subject with you as members of a parliament which, after all, has taken a long and keen interest in the efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. You have chosen an opportune moment for this debate. Hopes for peace in the Middle East are higher now than they have been for many years. The election of a new and more constructive government in Israel and the signing of the Sharm elSheikh Memorandum last month have set the stage for a relaunch of the peace process. There are clear signs too that both sides mean business. The first troop withdrawals, prisoner releases, and yesterday s agreement on the opening of the safe passage route between Gaza and the West Bank, all show that both Israelis and Palestinians have begun again their efforts to reach a permanent peace. The permanent status negotiations have recently started once more. The differences are not to be underestimated. But with political will on both sides, they need not be unbridgeable. The European Union will do all it can to help the parties meet the February deadline for concluding an umbrella agreement. We also believe that the permanent agreement should be concluded within the target period of one year, as Minister Sasi said, as stipulated in the Sharm elSheikh Memorandum and as called for by the European Council in Berlin.  So what can we in Europe do to stand by the peacemakers? It is right that we should match their renewed political commitment to move forward with practical support from the European Union. That, as the Presidency has just made clear, is what the Union collectively is doing. President Ahtisaari is in the Middle East, a point made by the Presidency, Ambassador Moratinos has been accompanying him and will I know continue to work hard to maximise the European Union s contribution in the coming vital months.  We are also pressing ahead with the implementation of projects such as the construction of the Gaza seaport and the safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza: projects which are invested with political and social as well as with economic importance. We are also hoping for an early relaunch of the Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks, and will continue to assist the parties with a view to early resumption of these crucial talks.  But peace in the Middle East has a broader dimension  it extends wider than the talks between Israel and the Palestinians, central though they are. That is why we are keen to revitalise the multilateral talks and regional cooperation. The Presidency and the Commission have renewed their call for a monitoring committee meeting of the regional economic development working group to take place as soon as possible. This is, of course, chaired by the European Union. After three years of impasse, this would bring Israelis, Egyptians, Palestinians and Jordanians together again at official level.  We are taking other practical steps which are calibrated to the new political climate. The Commission has stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs. We will propose to Member States next month financing of more than EUR  20 m for such projects. This package includes renewed assistance for peopletopeople activities and crossborder cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on nongovernmental and expert levels. The first generation of peopletopeople projects,  17  of them in all, costing some EUR  5 m, will start soon. Members will recall that the European Union, as the Presidency said, is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.  Let me say a word about our assistance to the Palestinians, a subject in which this Parliament has taken an appropriate interest. In general, we look to both Israelis and Palestinians to improve their performance in removing obstacles that prevent international aid from achieving its goals. The Palestinians, for their part, need to persevere in the path of sound institutionbuilding including, and I stress this point, budgetary transparency. In addition, Israel must find more effective ways of reconciling its legitimate security concerns with the urgent need for genuine Palestinian development.  We are pleased to have recently reached agreement on the update of the tripartite action plan. This plan, honourable Members will recall, details Israeli, Palestinian and international donor obligations in the framework of the assistance efforts to the Palestinian Authority. The improved political climate should, I hope, allow for more progress on these matters.  We have consistently pressed for the building of sound and accountable institutions in the Palestinian Authority. I am pleased to report, therefore, that President Arafat has endorsed the recently published report on strengthening Palestinian institutions, prepared by the independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations with substantial European Union assistance.  President Arafat has appointed several senior ministers to a special committee. They will meet the task force, including President Prodi, in Brussels next month to discuss the implementation of the report s farreaching recommendations.  We will also continue discussion on these issues at the upcoming meeting of the ad hoc liaison committee for assistance to the Palestinians  the meeting in Tokyo  which is the international donor mechanism. We will press for the next meeting of this committee to be held in Portugal in line with the understanding reached at the Frankfurt meeting last February. I have every confidence that we shall succeed in that. In view of our major share of total assistance to the Palestinians of over  50 , most future donor coordination meetings should, in our judgement, be held within the Union, cochaired by the European Union Member State hosting the meeting.  I am happy to report that the tenth convention between the Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was signed last week. The Commission has already initiated the first payments under the new convention. This will allow us to help deal with UNRWA s severe cash shortfall and to continue our crucial support to the Palestinian refugees.  Let me also express my gratitude to the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and indeed to the whole Parliament, for the very thorough report and for your support, in the framework of the consultation procedure, for the Commission s efforts in finalising the convention. I would like to pay particular tribute to the rapporteur, Ms Morgantini. Let me also thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, as well as the Committee on Budgets, for their support for the convention.  I have given you a summary of the efforts we are making with the presidency to help bring peace at last to the Middle East. We look to the parties to carry out in actions what they have put their names to on paper. In exchange, Europe will continue to play its full part in the peace process. But let me also stress that we intend to continue working closely with the United States, not as competitors, but as partners, in this matter. We recognise the crucial role of the United States, which has wrestled for so long and with such tenacity to bring peace to this troubled region; and I pay warm tribute to those efforts  for example, to the negotiating skill and determination of the Secretary of State.  It was Yitzak Rabin who famously remarked that you do not make peace with your friends. Noone underestimates the scale of the challenges ahead: peace will not come tomorrow. But peace will come  of that I am sure; with time and with patience, allied in equal measure to the will of the parties to achieve it and the will of outsiders to help bring it about. We have today a new chance for peace in the Middle East. Our task is to do all we can as Europeans to give that peace a chance and to hasten the day of its arrival. That is what we, with your active support and encouragement, intend to do.
4248974 author: Philip McNabb:  Firstly I should like to thank the European Parliament for the very encouraging and supportive approach taken on this matter. I must say for the first time in this Parliament that I have agreed with all the speakers. It has been very constructive and different viewpoints have been presented here. In particular, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, on his constructive report.  The progress in Parliament has also been of symbolic importance for future issues in the same area. The rapidity of the technological change is such that we need to strike a balance between rapid procedures and flexible legislation. Otherwise, we shall not be able to meet the requirements of the huge changes we see every day in the information society in its different sectors.  The directive which is on the agenda today deals with the use and legal recognition of electronic signatures. This is very important, as has been said so many times today. Doing business electronically is increasing rapidly both for companies and for consumers. The Internet will be pervasive in Europe in a matter of five years or so. We can expect half of the European population to be connected to the Internet by  2005  and not only via PC, but increasingly via mobile communication devices. That was the message everyone received from Geneva Telecom two weeks ago.  The use of electronic signatures is an important means of ensuring authenticity in the future electronic world. Without it there will be no safe electronic communications for European citizens. In fact, even further growth in Internet usage may even be slowed down due to the growing concerns of security and privacy. The bottom line is that without security and trust there will not be a notable shift towards commercial and financial transactions on the Internet.  This directive is not designed to regulate everything, neither is it meant to replace the market. It offers legal recognition of electronic signatures where currently only the paper form is recognised, thus providing for more security in the market place. Furthermore, it secures the internal market for electronic signature products and services. But there is also a considerable international dimension to this initiative. The Internet and ecommerce are global by nature. Therefore, other international organisations like the United Nations and the OECD are increasingly active in the field of electronic signatures. Almost all US states either have an electronic signature law in place or are preparing one. Japan is also drafting a law in this area. Hence, having a harmonised European legal framework in place would strengthen Europe s position in the international context.  We also need this directive to avoid divergent approaches in Member States law, as has been mentioned. Today, all EU Member States agree on the importance of electronic signatures to ensure security and trust in electronic communication. This is good news. We can build on this by avoiding obstacles to the free circulation of electronic signature products and services within the internal market.  As to the amendments proposed, the Commission can accept them with the exception of one. We have a problem with Amendment No  6  because, according to our interpretation, it goes against the Treaty because the Treaty provides that these kinds of proposals must be submitted to the Council. In that context the European Parliament is not mentioned.  All in all, I want to repeat that I am very pleased about the high degree of consensus between the positions of the Commission and the European Parliament.  It is in the interests of all of us to support the fast progress of this matter. With this aim in mind, I should like to suggest that Parliament reconsider Amendment No  6  in order to avoid an unnecessary conciliation procedure. In this context, the Treaty does not leave room for interpretation.  Thank you for your cooperation. I hope that this kind of rapid consensual cooperation can be taken by us with many new initiatives in the same field which are already now in Parliament or expected later this year and next.
8766345 author: Victor Cameron:  Mr President, I am now putting on a different hat to present my report to Parliament. I would very much like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for entrusting me with this job a week after I assumed my mandate, and I see a number of colleagues are here in support.  I will try to make this a simple presentation. It is an important piece of single market legislation that establishes uniform technical requirements on a key component of the motor vehicle fuel tank. The proposal achieves four important objectives. The first is that it introduces uniform test standards for plastic fuel tanks; that covers all types of motor vehicles, both cars and commercial vehicles. Some of you may be aware that plastic material is increasingly being used across the motor industry and this uniform test standard will allow designers to concentrate on meeting one single standard, instead of having to divert their efforts to meet a whole range of different standards.  It is often felt that these technical directives may not mean a great deal to consumers, but I must point out from my experience as an engineer in the car industry that if we allow engineers to concentrate on making safer and cleaner vehicles instead of having to meet a whole series of different regulations, that in the end will be very beneficial for customers and users. That is the first objective.  The second is the provision for the technical requirements to be extended in future through a regulatory committee procedure to introduce new standards for fuel tanks containing gaseous fuels. This is an important and forwardlooking proposal because gaseous fuels are increasingly being used  and I refer for example to things like liquefied natural gas and petroleum gas  and there is also the prospect of hydrogen becoming a fuel in the future. This is a sensible measure; yet this relatively straightforward technical measure has already taken  18  months to get to this point of second reading. That does not seem to me to be a very sensible use of administrative time. That is the second point.  The third point is that it provides for typeapproval to be extended in cases where motor vehicles are fitted, after they have been built, with additional fuel tanks for additional fuels or additional larger tanks. That again is increasingly important for safety.  Those three principal objectives were in the original proposal that came from the Commission to Parliament on first reading and has subsequently resulted in the common position. Parliament, at its first reading, was particularly concerned to add an important extra objective, namely to address the problem of diesel fuel spillage on the highway, which has been posing an increasing safety hazard for road users, particularly riders of motor cycles.  Parliament proposed that this should be addressed. This was rejected by the Commission, but the common position from the Council did contain this measure. This fuel spillage has resulted from inadequately fitted fuel filler caps, and the directive that we are now putting before you, with Parliament s amendments at second reading designed to tighten up those provisions, addresses this question by requiring motor vehicle fuel tanks to have positive closure mechanisms so that the cap is always securely closed.  We have added recitals explicitly setting this out as an objective of the legislation and tightening those technical requirements to make sure that provision is effective. I am sure that will have the full support of the House.  In presenting that to you, I would like to say that this is not the only solution to the problem and our committee wishes to draw attention to the need for other committees to address this safety hazard through the forthcoming emission directive for heavy commercial vehicles and also through vehicle test standards, to make sure that faulty fuel filler caps are picked up, either in roadside or annual testing of commercial vehicles.  To conclude, Mr President, the final element of this proposal is the committee procedure for maintaining and enhancing the technical nature of this directive, and I referred to this earlier. Parliament, at second reading, proposed a change to the commitology arrangements but, in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I have not recommended that those amendments be supported. I am proposing that the Council and Commission s proposal for a regulatory committee be endorsed. This issue will come up when we discuss Mr Ferri s proposal later.  In conclusion, I commend this proposal to the House. It is a sensible, straightforward single market proposal with a number of important features and I hope it will have your unanimous support.
4614618 author: Sarah Whittacker:  Mr President, like others who have already participated in this debate I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs, but in particular Mr Bourlanges. In his opening remarks, he clarified for us the perspective for the  2000  budget in putting forward the idea that we have to have more programmes, we have to have more countries and we have to have less money. There seems to be a contradiction here which, in the longer term when we come to enlargement, when we come to a new intergovernmental conference, we are quite clearly going to have to resolve in the context of our budget procedures.  For my part, I would like to focus my remarks on three aspects which concern the running of European policies and the attitudes which we have taken in Parliament in previous years to these aspects. This is in the particular context of the Commission. We, as a parliament, want to make sure that accountability is seen to work for those who elected us and to make sure that we have value for money in the running of the programmes.  The first item in internal policy refers to information policy. In the last Parliament we wanted to make sure that we had proper functioning interinstitutional cooperation. We made progress in that respect by making sure that in terms of the general information lines, in terms of the specific campaigns, we had good cooperation on both sides. But we did not arrive at a common framework for this interinstitutional cooperation as we in Parliament had wanted.  There is some degree of concern at some of the initial moves the Commission is now making in its information structures which we in Parliament will keep a close eye on. In particular, we had asked in the last Parliament, and indeed in previous Parliaments, for the Commission and Parliament offices to work closely together in the Member States. I have put down an amendment, our group has put down an amendment, to make sure that we can have a report from the Commission on how far this has gone. There are still one or two countries where the Commission and Parliament are separate in terms of structure and we need to be particularly vigilant in instances where more than  75  or  80  of the appropriations go into paying for salaries and buildings rather than adequate information policies.  Secondly, in terms of external policy, particularly in terms of Kosovo, the hearing we organised a few days ago with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, was very revealing to me, in particular the fact that this is not a shortterm commitment. We had evidence from Mr Bildt, Mr Kouchner, Mr Hombach and then from all the other agencies, that this is a longterm problem we have in front of us. We must, therefore, make sure not only that we get proper coherence between the agencies working on the ground but also Madam Presidentofthe Council, that we do not take decisions which mean that we are spending money futilely because of a Council decision that we must have some people removed some  100  miles away in another place. We must make sure that when we come to Mrs Pack s report later this week we take the right decisions and that the Council understands Parliament s feelings on that.  In the longer term, we must ensure that we have vision and  as you said Commissioner  we need to have the idea of building civil society in the longer term, not just as some kind of shortterm project. Kosovo and stability in the Balkans must be a longterm project. It is us, as Europeans, who have to take that responsibility. We cannot expect others to take on that particular responsibility for us. I therefore welcome the idea of a working committee between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets. We must make sure not only that funds are properly spent but that the ideas which are coming through are properly coordinated.  Lastly, in terms of administration policy, there are the Technical Assistance Offices. I would underline what Mr Bge said to the Council. The Council has been absent from this debate on discharge. With nonchalant ease, they have gone through approving the  1996 , the  1997  discharge, and it has been up to us in Parliament to press for change at every turn. Therefore in terms of EU reform we are right, as a parliament, to say that we do not wish to see new posts until we know where the posts are going. What are the real needs of the Commission?  Secondly, we are right to say that we should not have Technical Assistance Offices performing tasks through temporary officials in what are meant to be permanent posts for the Commission. We must find some way of having a dialogue between the institutions over the next  12  months to make sure that these reforms take place and that we have the right kind of criteria for making sure that we are getting value for money from the staff. Otherwise  and I will end on this proposal: we must start cutting programmes if we do not have the proper staff resources available to run them, because ultimately we must make sure that these processes are accountable and we must make sure that we get value for money in the system.
5766493 author: Victor Bush:  Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in relation to the Virrankoski report. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good approach to this issue and to say that the Socialist Group broadly agrees with the matters he has raised.  On the issue of staffing, which affects all the institutions, we take the view that we have to find a balance between financial prudence and the ability of the institutions to do their job properly. As we have just heard, there is a danger of the institutions taking on new tasks which they are unable to resource properly. Mr Virrankoski has just about got the balance right. We would have liked to be a bit more generous to Parliament in terms of staffing resources.  On the European Parliament section of the budget, we firstly welcome the fact there has been a marked change in attitude between the Bureau and the Budgets Committee. As someone who sits on both, perhaps I can comment on this. The way in which the Bureau and the Budgets Committee have worked together to come to a compromise on Parliament s budget has been very constructive. I want to highlight just three issues within Parliament budget.  One is the issue of the Members Statute. There was a suggestion that we should put money on the line for a Members Statute. The Socialists rejected this idea, not in any way to weaken our approach to the Members Statute; through our comments we indicate we strongly support the notion of a Members Statute but believe it is now up to the Council to respond to Parliament s proposals in this area.  Similarly with political parties, the Socialist Group strongly supports the notion of European political parties. But you simply cannot put money on the line without having an idea of who is going to qualify for this money, what purposes the money is going to be used for, and so on. Parliament has produced an excellent report  the Tsatsos report  in this area. It is now up to the Commission to bring forward a proposal on how we might implement the proposal for a European political party. Once that happens, again the Socialists would be happy to negotiate the idea of putting money on the line.  Finally, and perhaps something that you and I, Mr President, take a personal interest in, the notion of regional offices. The Bureau of Parliament last night decided that Edinburgh, Marseilles, Milan, Munich and Barcelona should all have regional offices. We have put money in the reserve in the budget. When we come to second reading, I hope we can release that money from the reserve and get on with implementing the policy of regional offices. They are vital in terms of Parliament s strategy of bringing Parliament closer to the people.  The only other institution s budget I want to talk about specifically and briefly is the Court of Justice s budget. My view, and I am sure the view of many in this House, is that justice delayed is often justice denied. It is quite clear that the Court of Justice has not had the resources to carry out its tasks properly. The Council has made a limited gesture in terms of improving staffing of the Court. Parliament wants to go further. I hope we will support the rapporteur s proposal here. In particular, delays in interpretation and translation are causing major problems for the Court. We should do all in our power to resolve this. The Virrankoski report does that.  I turn briefly to the Bourlanges report which is outwith my own remit. I put on record my support for Mr Bourlanges approach to the  2000  budget. He is absolutely right to reject the  10  across the board crude reduction in development lines. It is true, as the Council says, that some development lines have not been used well. It is true that some suffer from underspend. But simply to say that we cut them all by  10  is a very crude mechanism. The Council needs to make a more refined proposal before we come to second reading. At the moment, the rapporteur is absolutely right. Money for East Timor, Kosovo and other emergencies like Turkey, has to come from new money unless the Council makes a more refined proposal.  To pick up Mr Elles last point on the Technical Assistance Offices, again, the Council has been silent on this. It was the root of the problem with the Santer Commission. What the rapporteur has said in his report is absolutely right on this issue. Again, the Socialist Group gives him  100  backing.
1172035 author: Michael Brown:  Mr President, it is customary to congratulate and thank the rapporteurs and I will do that as chairman of the committee, and there are three of them  let us not forget that. First of all, Mr Virrankoski who has done a thorough job. He came to this position halfway through the year; his attitude has been exemplary and he really deserves the congratulations of Parliament, not just the committee. Secondly, Mr Pittella who, as a new member, came to the committee and has made quite a significant point about the phasingin of the ECSC funds. It is quite an innovative approach and he should be congratulated. And while we are giving out congratulations I shall also congratulate the Commissioner on her speech which was politically realistic. Well done Commissioner!  But the main congratulations go to Mr Bourlanges. When Mr Bourlanges began he said it was the first time he had had  15  minutes to speak in Parliament, and my immediate thought was yes and that will not be long enough . Sure enough it was not long enough  he exceeded it by almost a minute and still had not said half the things he wanted to say. Mr Bourlanges, I congratulate you on your approach to the budget. It is fair to say there has never been a dull moment. You are pragmatic, innovative and, most importantly, serious. That is shown in your attitude towards the BATs. You may well be known as BATman Bourlanges although I cannot quite see you with a cape and mask, wearing underpants outside your pants, but you have done an extremely good job on the BATs!  This first reading is predominantly about the asterisk amendment concerning Kosovo, the Morocco fisheries agreement, East Timor and Turkey, which was mentioned by the rapporteur. I have to stress this point quite clearly to the Council and  to a lesser extent  to the Commission because I think they understand. We take the interinstitutional agreement extremely seriously. There are forces within this Parliament which would quite happily see it scrapped tomorrow but as far as I am concerned my job  and the job of Parliament per se  is to defend the agreement which we made earlier this year. We have shown that we are prepared to do that. If we were against it the Category  3  ceiling would have been exceeded, and on that point, incidentally, all three institutions have a problem with the amount deemed necessary for codecision lines such as Socrates. This is not just a problem for the year  2000 , it is an ongoing problem. Can I say to both the presidency and the Commission that this is something we need to find a solution to together and quickly.  The amendment for Category  4  should not be seen as Parliament just flexing its muscles. I hasten to add this is not a threat  though that may sound like a contradiction of something I have to say a little later on. But I do not want the Council to see it as a threat. We do not want the Council thinking that we think we have them by the Balkans so to speak; we are not trying to squeeze them too hard, though that may be the wrong phrase to use. It should be seen as an invitation for our two institutions to sit down and agree a solution. That is what we should be aiming to do, PresidentinOffice.  We look forward to the proposal from the Commission which will come forward next week. In the light of what Mrs Schreyer has said, I look forward with anticipation. I hope the Council can do the same. But I do need to stress to the Council that this is not the Grand Old Duke of York marching his troops up the hill, just to march them down again. This is not just some act by Parliament to mount a show of force, but at the end of the day Member States will put pressure on individual Members whose parties are in government to get us to change our mind. Things do not work like that because of the majorities that now exist within this Parliament. If we do not get an agreement on the revision of the Financial Perspective especially, I am fairly certain that Article  272  will be invoked. There is no doubt about that and Council should be in no doubt about that whatsoever. That it is not a threat, it is a statement of intent.  Let me reiterate the philosophy of two of my predecessors: Mr von der Vring and Mr Samland. I want the Council to take back this message. What we are fighting for is Parliament s rights, we are not fighting for money. It is about the rights of this Parliament and that is the message they have to understand through and through. Once they understand that message I am quite sure that the discussions we should and will have will be fruitful. I know the political constraints that Member States are working within, we are all serious about  as you put it  the principles of cost efficiency and rigour. We abide by those same principles but in this instance, after what Parliament has fought for over the years, this revision of the interinstitutional agreement, a revision of the Financial Perspective as outlined in the interinstitutional agreement, is extremely important to Parliament. I hope that is understood.
4946933 author: Mary Cameron:  It is an honour to be chosen as the rapporteur for this important report. This is the first occasion on which the European Parliament has given its views on the progress of the European Central Bank and in this context it is my pleasant duty to congratulate the ECB and Mr Duisenberg, as President, on its success so far.  The launch of the euro itself is a truly historic moment in the life of an extraordinary undertaking. It represents a substantial technical achievement and the many officials involved deserve our thanks and our appreciation.  Clearly it is still early days in terms of judgement on the results of the ECB s mandate but here, too, we can already point to many positive signs, not least that investors are prepared to lend euro area governments their money at very low rates of interest. This is a real vote of confidence that the ECB will continue to deliver price stability and will not allow an inflationary erosion of people s savings.  It is very much in this context of overwhelming support for the objectives of the ECB and of praise for its achievements so far that my remaining remarks should be seen. Only if the ECB is open about the way it reaches its decisions will it be able to retain support in bad times as well as in good. It may achieve its objective of price stability but without openness it will not be clear whether that objective has been attained by design and can therefore be repeated in future or by lucky accident which may therefore require some improvement in its methods of working.  The committee was also struck by the fact that other central banks have moved more rapidly in recent years towards greater openness. The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Sweden s Riksbank, the Bank of England all publish the individual votes of the committee that decides interest rates. They all publish forecasts, they all give information about the nature of the debate within their governing councils. In all of these respects  objective measures of transparency  the ECB lags behind normal international practice.  The committee therefore proposes, firstly that the ECB should publish a summary minute giving both sides of the argument, for and against monetary actions. Secondly, the ECB should publish a sixmonthly forecast of economic developments in the euro area. Mr Duisenberg s remarks to us today are particularly welcome in that respect because he has promised that he that will do just that within the next year. Thirdly, the ECB should discuss on a regular basis developments in each of the Member States of the euro area in order to have a positive influence on price and wage developments which must, as Mr Duisenberg rightly pointed out, differ from Member State to Member State. Finally, the committee may request that the President appears following each significant monetary action. These measures would do much to foster a culture of transparency.  The committee was unable to support a call now for the publication of votes as is in the Liberal group amendment today. It was felt that a young institution should have time to find its feet. Most members felt that publication might intensify the public pressures on governing council members to vote in line with their national interest. Similarly, the committee did not support the Liberal position that it would be useful to publish the ECB s econometric models of the euro area, partly for fear that they may be abused.  The committee also rejected the Greens view as expressed in their amendment today, that the price stability mandate should be altered to take account of the difficulties faced by manufacturers alone if their prices fall. The amendment from the EPP, however, clarifies the paragraph and should, in our view, be supported.  Mr President, I would like to highlight briefly some other points that we make. The first is to thank Mr Duisenberg again for his assurance to this House that the process of cooperation between the ECB and the national central banks is now adequate, even in the case of a serious crisis in which a euro area financial institution may need to be supported. I would also like to stress the committee s view that the ECB should bring pressure to bear on those Member States which rely excessively on shortterm debt, as this can present dangers, particularly during a financial crisis.  Thirdly, we encourage the ECB to fulfil its role on the international stage as one of the three main pillars of the international monetary system.  Finally, I very much welcome, too, Mr Duisenberg s taking up of a point in the report about the need to reduce the costs of crossborder payments, particularly for smaller payments which affect individual members.  Mr President, if the euro is as great a success as I hope and expect, it will play its part in revolutionising the European economy. By completing the single European market it will give Europe s consumers more choice of goods and services, of higher quality and at lower prices and will, therefore, spur greater increases in living standards. It will provide jobs in expanding industries which is the only sure guarantee of future prosperity. Although I have no doubt that the ECB will face many difficult challenges in the years ahead, I am pleased to report that so far it has risen to the challenges it has faced with considerable lan. We can look forward to a future which builds on its recent success.
3304025 author: Marc Smith:  First of all I should like to say that the Commission shares the presidency s positive point of view on the outcome of the European Tampere Council. We would like to warmly congratulate the Finnish Prime Minister, both for the preparations which preceded the meeting and for the way in which he personally chaired its proceedings.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conclusions reached in Tampere combine a strong political message on the priority given to the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice with the concern to define priorities which concentrate on those issues which directly affect the daily lives of Europe s citizens.  The Heads of State and Government have thus set themselves the obligation to respect the solemn commitment they made in Tampere. The Commission, on the basis of dialogue and cooperation with the European Parliament, is prepared to do everything necessary in order to create an area of freedom, security and justice which, above all, achieves balance between its three components: freedom, security and justice.  The letter that President Romano Prodi wrote to the European Council highlighted our main concern which was that Tampere should not be a restrictive summit. This objective was achieved. The Commission is particularly pleased with this fact. And I would like to emphasise that the steadfast affirmation of the untouchable nature of the Geneva Convention as a basis for constructing a European asylum policy is something that merits our backing and applause.  We are pleased with the commitment given at the highest level to working in partnership with countries of origin and transit countries in confronting immigration issues. We are pleased with the far greater emphasis given to fighting the trade in human beings than to action against its victims in relation to illegal immigration. The Commission backs the clear affirmation of the importance of prevention in the fight against crime, whether it is financial crime, crime in the cities or juvenile crime, and notes that its efforts to give special prominence to the rights of victims of criminal activity have been recognised.  The Commission agrees with the proactive view of the establishment of a European concept of access to justice as an instrument for people to exercise their right to free movement without obstacles of a legal or administrative nature. It is also necessary that this right to free circulation should now be accompanied by the legislative measures which are necessary for us to be able to achieve it as quickly as possible.  The Commission is pleased with the establishment of the principle of harmonising, as fully as possible, the rights of citizens originally from third countries, but who have lived for a long time in the Union, with the rights and duties granted to citizens who are nationals of the Union s Member States. We realise that we will have to move forward with specific proposals in this area.  Finally, the Commission would like to single out the establishment of the clear priority given to fighting racism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination, which are laid down in Article  13  of the Treaty, as being a very positive move.  Similarly, the Tampere conclusions tackle, in an appropriate way, the strengthening of cooperation between police forces and between judicial authorities in order to protect and preserve the freedoms of Europe s citizens. The conclusions do this in a way which is necessary in order to respond to citizens legitimate concerns about security and about the judicial guarantee of their rights, as is fitting in a Union which claims to be founded on the principle of the prevalence of rights and of the law.  I would like to highlight, in this regard, the principle of mutual recognition of decisions and sentences, which all Member States should contribute to by adopting common definitions and penalties against certain criminal activities which transcend borders,. This would cover areas such as organised crime, illegal drug trafficking, the trade in human beings, or crimes against children. I would also like to highlight the establishment of the EUROJUST network which is, without any doubt, the beginning of the construction of a European Judicial system which will be an instrument of support and monitoring for EUROPOL s actions in guaranteeing security within the Union and which will also be an instrument for protecting the rights of European citizens.  The Commission is looking at its own role and proposes to act by responding to the ambitious action plan for fighting moneylaundering, which involves changes both in the Union s position towards the rest of the world, and also at the level of legislation in each Member State.  However, Madam President, Tampere did not fully meet all of the Commission s expectations. Without wishing to criticise the positive results which, to a large extent, have just been highlighted by the PresidentinOffice of the Council, I cannot help admitting that on some points, the Commission is rather disappointed. The Commission regrets that the European Council has not accepted the idea of a single asylum system which represents, as we see it, something to aim for, but also the urgent necessity of dealing with asylum issues in a collective and coherent way. The Commission will not stop making proposals which will allow us to dispel any possible fears that a centralised asylum system may bring about in some Member States.  Similarly, I regret the fact that some Member States were reluctant to support the idea of a European refugee fund, even though the Commission made it clear that this fund would not involve any new or additional expenditure. The lessons drawn from Bosnia and Kosovo reinforce our conviction that it is crucial to persist in explaining our aims, which we hope will happen before the end of the current year, specifically in the context of preparing the  2000  budget.  Tampere did not allow the idea of a European Public Prosecutor to be adopted yet, even one who would be limited to protecting the Community s financial interests. I would like to suggest that the next debate on the Intergovernmental Conference might be a good opportunity to take up this idea of ours once again.  An event like Tampere, with the expectations which precede it, can sometimes appear to be an end in itself. It is only the beginning of a process. The Commission believes, however, that Tampere sent out the right message to many different audiences: to our citizens, first of all, that a subject high on their personal agenda is also rising quickly to the top of the Union s political agenda; to national administrations that there is no turning back and that their own heads of government are committed to making the improvements, including the institutional improvements of the Amsterdam Treaty, work properly; to the criminal world, that the Union is mobilising all its potential to counter their activities which threaten our freedom and our wellbeing, if not our own democratic regimes; finally, to the outside world, that an internally secure Union does not mean a fortress Union and that our commitments to those in need of protection are sacred. That is not a bad start.  There is an enormous task ahead, not least for the Commission, to whom the European Council entrusted numerous tasks, thus showing a gratifying confidence in us. With the help and cooperation of Parliament and the necessary resources to do the job I am confident that we will be able to play the part that has been allocated to us by Tampere.  We certainly plan to begin by working on how to create the scoreboard requested of us as a way of keeping up the pressure on ourselves, in the first instance, but also on others, as well as ensuring that everything takes place with the fullest possible transparency in the very near future.  If either you, in Parliament, or we, in the Commission, see any signs of backsliding we will not hesitate to remind heads of state and government of their message from Tampere. When I say their message from Tampere , it is not only the message in the letter of Tampere but also what we could call the spirit of Tampere.  (Applause)
4907946 author: Mary Bauer:  The Commission shares the disappointment that has just been expressed by the presidency of the Council that the United States Senate rejected ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  The Treaty, as honourable Members will know, is the result of decades of hard work, decades of determined work to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, starting with the NonProliferation Treaty in the late  1960 s. It constitutes a key element in the international strategy to control, reduce and ultimately to eliminate the risk of nuclear conflict. Its ratification by the present nuclear powers is essential for our efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries.  The European Union, as the presidency has pointed out, has been and remains fully committed to these objectives. We have worked hard for the earliest possible entry into force of the Treaty. All  15  Member States, bar one, have already ratified the Treaty and work is under way in the  15 th state to complete the procedures there.  I know that the American administration shares our objectives. President Clinton and his team worked hard to obtain Congressional approval for ratification of the Treaty. They understood, as well as we do, how important it is for us to take the lead together in order to obtain the  44  ratifications which are necessary for the entry into force of the Treaty.  It is therefore all the more regrettable that the Senate voted against ratification. They seem to have done so for internal American reasons as much as on the basis of any assessment of the value of this Treaty for United States and international security.  I believe  and this is reflected in the motion put before us today  that they made a very grave mistake. In refusing to give their agreement to the Treaty they offer encouragement to the very states which we wanted to draw into the commitments set out in the Treaty and whose ratification is a condition for its entry into force.  What message has been sent to Russia and China? How will this vote help to persuade countries like India and Pakistan to ratify the Treaty? This regrettable vote may even offer encouragement to other countries in their nuclear aspirations and make them cross the threshold by testing their own nuclear devices.  Any such nuclear tests at this stage might undo all the work which has gone into the Treaty. They would undermine international support and confidence in the multilateral arms control efforts. More seriously, they might trigger reciprocal actions in other countries through testing or through the strengthening of their nuclear programmes.  The Senate refusal to agree to ratify the Treaty is a setback but it is not the end of the road. We must now, more than ever, show our commitment to the Treaty and redouble our efforts to promote its early entry into force. This is essential in order to maintain the international momentum in favour of continued arms limitation and a stronger global nonproliferation regime.  The Commission has consistently supported an ambitious European Union policy on nonproliferation issues. Wherever possible, we have complemented CFSP initiatives in this area with action falling within Community competence. Under the Euratom Treaty, for example, we have contributed to the development and strengthening of an efficient nuclear safeguard system in Europe, including the Russian Federation. Activities in this field are supported by financial allocations under the PHARE and TACIS programmes. We are currently considering extending these activities to other areas such as safeguards on chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.  The common strategy on Russia also contains specific provisions on nonproliferation. In this context we are examining the scope of cooperation with the United States on the expanded threat reduction initiative.  Accession to the Treaty is also a crucial element in our policy towards South Asia, as the presidency made clear. Following the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan the Commission has participated in the international taskforce set up to develop confidence and securitybuilding measures and to engage these countries in constructive discussions on regional nonproliferation and arms control.  Over the years remarkable progress has been made in international arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament, through both bilateral and multilateral efforts. In the multilateral context the ratification of the Treaty and the review of the nonproliferation treaty next year will be crucial to reconfirming earlier commitments and building a platform for further progress.  To achieve this we need to work with the United States and other leading partners. The leading role played by the United States has been essential in developing the global nonproliferation regime. I hope we can encourage our American friends to take up that role again.  We should do everything we can to convince Congress of the importance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for ourselves, for the United States and for the international nonproliferation efforts. I can assure you that the Commission will continue to bring its contribution to this objective.  I also believe that all honourable Members have a particular role to play in this respect. I would hope that you would use every opportunity to explain and underline to your colleagues in the Senate why they should reconsider their vote on the Treaty and how a renewed commitment to international nonproliferation and arms control will promote American security interests, as well as broader international security and stability.  In that marvellous newspaper the International Herald Tribune, there is today a shortened version of a speech given the other day to the Council on Foreign Relations by the President s national security adviser Sandy Berger. American opponents of treaties like the one we are debating today neglected the fact, he pointed out, that the United States has already stopped testing and that the Treaty helped freeze the global development of nuclear weapons when America enjoys an enormous strategic advantage. I hope that, to borrow an unattractively appropriate phrase, the fallout from this lamentable political decision can be contained. I know that is what the American administration wants. It is what we all want. American senators and congressmen should face up to the responsibilities of their country s global position. It places a high premium on bipartisanship in foreign policy in general and in nuclear policy in particular. Failure to recognise that condemns us all to live in a much less safe world.
9381379 author: Victor Finlayson:  The debate has been dominated by concerns about the North Caucasus. But there are, as Mr Paasilinna pointed out, grounds for concern about the situation in the South Caucasus as well. The honourable Member pointed to the alarming reports of the shooting in the Armenian parliament today and the reported assassination of the Prime Minister. We await confirmation of that tragic news, but it appears the news is probably accurate.  I saw the Armenian Foreign Minister recently to discuss his concerns about the stability of the Southern Caucasus and, as well, to hear some of the concerns that he was expressing about Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus. I should like to say on this occasion that the Commission wants to reiterate its support for the Armenian Government in its efforts to find a rapid and peaceful solution to the situation in the Caucasus. What has happened today is deeply troubling.  This debate has focused on Chechnya, which was the subject of some very straight talking in Helsinki with some Members understandably asserting that the European Union should have done something more than it has done already. I think it is perhaps an inevitable consequence of a debate like that, that there was not absolute clarity on what it was that we should have done.  I want to reiterate some points that were made earlier by the presidency. The communiqu, as the honourable Member pointed out, referred to the fact that we had exchanged views on the situation in the Northern Caucasus. The communiqu did not say any more than that for a very good reason: we could not put in the communiqu that we had agreed on anything regarding the Northern Caucasus.  What the European Union asserted strongly was: first of all, that whatever the concerns about Chechen terrorism  which are understandable  there is a powerful case for proportionality in dealing with that problem; secondly, we argued passionately for deescalation and political dialogue. The problem, if you appear to undermine and destroy the authority of any moderate leaders in Chechnya, is this: who do you then talk to? Who do you then have a political dialogue with? That is a point that we put very strongly to Prime Minister Putin, both during the official discussions and over lunch when Chechnya completely dominated the discussion.  We argued very strongly for the aid assessment mission to be allowed into Ingushetia as rapidly as possible. I spoke last week to the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance at the UN. I spoke last week to Mrs Ogata in the UNHCR. I read, as honourable Members will have done, the reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross on the humanitarian crisis which gets worse day by day in the Northern Caucasus. The ICRC suggested last week that over one third of the population of Grozny had left already. So we pressed the Russians to recognise that there must be an early visit by aid organisations to the region so we know what the situation is and how we can best contribute to the humanitarian problem.  I hope that the honourable Member who suggested that we should perhaps consider cutting off any humanitarian assistance will have second thoughts about that. I have been a development minister providing humanitarian assistance on a national basis to countries torn apart by war. I have never believed that cutting off assistance to those who are affected by war, who are affected by the political decisions taken by their rulers, was a very good way of responding to crisis.  Let me just add a word about the funding of the military campaign which, in my judgement  not a judgement which appears to be supported by the Russian Prime Minister  is bound to have an effect on the recovery over the last months of the Russian economy.  Some Members suggested that we should cut off financial assistance to the Russian Federation because that assistance might be used to sustain the military campaign. I should just like to remind Members of Parliament, who are probably more familiar with some of the details of these issues than even I am, that we are not the provider of direct financial assistance to the Russian authorities. That is not how Tacis works. We are not an international financial institution providing financial assistance for the reconstruction  we hope  of the Russian economy. People should be clear that what we are doing is not sustaining Russian military campaigns in Chechnya or anywhere else.  But when you start talking about cutting off programmes of assistance to Russia you have to face up to some of the consequences. An issue about which I feel passionately is the successful negotiation of the multilateral nuclear environment programme, the attempt to ensure that Western donors can provide technical and financial assistance for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste in northwest Russia, including all those terrifying, rusting nuclear submarines and the other nuclear garbage.  It is very important for all of us that we make a programme like that succeed. I hope we can push on with talks about programmes like that even while we talk firmly and strongly to the Russians about the tragedy in the Northern Caucasus in Chechnya.  One point that we made to Russian officials, to the Prime Minister, was that we were talking strongly on these issues, not as enemies but as people who wanted a cooperative relationship with Russia. We were talking strongly because we were reflecting the opinions of our public in the European Union: the sort of opinions reflected in speech after speech in this Chamber today.  So what this debate has done is to underline the argument that we were putting to Mr Putin and others. It is an argument which I hope they will take very seriously over the coming days and weeks.  There must be a return to negotiation, difficult though that may seem to Russian leaders. There must be a return to negotiation otherwise I fear that we will see disaster loaded upon disaster. In those circumstances I do not think that anyone s opinion poll ratings are going to hold up for very long.
840419 author: Jennifer Reid:  Mr President, first of all our group did not sign this resolution for a number of very important reasons. We find it very onesided and a blatant demand for Morocco to give in to European demands regardless of what it wants. We Greens believe it is up to Morocco to decide how best to benefit from its resources in its own waters.  One of the most deplorable aspects of this resolution is the failure to address the issue of the Western Sahara. Last night a representative of the Saharoui people spoke to the Greens. He told us of EUflag vessels fishing off the coast of Western Sahara. The border of the Western Sahara is established at  27   4  . North of that is Morocco and south of that is the Western Sahara. We all know that the Saharoui people are supposed to vote in a referendum very soon on selfdetermination but of course many serious problems have been posed by the Moroccans.  There is no EU country that has recognised Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, but according to the Saharoui people, at the same time the EU pays EUR  500  million to Morocco. EU vessels fish hake and other species in waters off Morocco, and Morocco has no legal jurisdiction in these waters. Many people believe this constitutes illegal fishing. Some might even go as far as to call it piracy. These are very serious allegations and I should also point out that similar allegations have been made as regards Somalia.  I would ask the Commission what assurances it can give that this is not happening. Current agreements with Morocco have provisions for an experimental satellite system. Can the Commission reassure us, through the results, that EU vessels are not engaging in illegal fishing. I should add that the representative stressed that they had no problem whatsoever with EUMorocco agreements. Their concern was that it be legal , that is, restricted to Moroccan waters only.  Our problems with the resolution are not just on this point  although it is a very serious issue. The Greens would like to stress first of all that we are not, as many people would have it, against fisheries agreements with third countries but we have very important conditions that we want attached to those agreements. We want them to be more equitable, less environmentally and socially damaging and consistent with other Community policies.  There are specific criteria that we would like to follow. First of all with regard to all EU fisheries agreements, not just Moroccan agreements: they should follow the precautionary approach. Most people subscribe to this in theory but not in practice. Simply put, in the case of agreements there must be clear scientific proof that added fishing pressure from proposed EU activities will not compromise sustainability of fish stocks. If we cannot be sure that fish are available these particular species should not be put in the agreement.  The second criteria is that the regional approach should be followed. All countries involved in fishing the relevant stocks, be they coastal states or distant water states, should be involved in assessments of stocks and negotiations over how much fishing is done and who has the right to do it. This approach is followed very successfully in the South Pacific on tuna and there is no reason whatsoever that it should not apply here.  There is a consistent EU approach of negotiating with one state at a time. This is not acceptable. Control is also a very big problem in most of these agreements. The third countries simply do not have the resources to ensure that the vessels from the EU and other distant water fleets respect the rules.  We know the problems that the Member States have in their own waters, so it must be very difficult indeed for these other countries to be able to tackle these problems. Satellite systems are a very small but positive step, but a lot more needs to be done. In  1997  the Council requested an indepth analysis of the EU third country agreements. The summary report is now available. It was discussed on Tuesday at the Council meeting. We welcome this study very much and hope that the Council will now conduct a wideranging debate, both within the Council itself and with other sectors of society, about these EU fisheries agreements.  Some of the conclusions of the report are questionable but at least it provides some hard information and figures on the agreements. This is something that was sorely needed and has been called for for a long time.  Another point I want to make, as previous speakers have and, I suspect, most of the following speakers will, concerns the importance of this and other fisheries agreements to certain regions of the Community which are heavily dependent upon fishing. The Greens sympathise with their plight and trust that appropriate compensation will be made available for those fishery workers who are put out of work in the eventuality of a halt in fishing activities. But the current EU policy is doing them a disservice by continually holding out hopes that there are fish available for them somewhere. It is fanning false hopes. It is clear that there are limits to how much fish is available. For many years the FAO has been warning of the problems, yet we keep looking for fish somewhere else until there is nowhere else. If one looks at Community statistics on employment in the sector, it is clear that this is on the decline. Much of this is due to the continued industrialisation of the sector, developing even larger vessels which require fewer people. While this serves to make fishermen s lives easier and safer, it does come with certain social costs in terms of employment. The aspect of employment in all sectors of the fishing industry needs to be reviewed. It is affected by many factors including structural policy which does not take employment into account in issues of vessel size.  Finally, to come back again to the point of Morocco s right to make its own decisions. On behalf of the Green Group, I went with the Committee on Fisheries last year to Morocco and the Moroccans were very clear: they did not want to sign the last agreement. They did so only under extreme pressure from the European Union including a letter from Jacques Santer pleading and begging with the Moroccans to agree this last time; this would be the last agreement; the EU needed time to find another solution. But nothing has been done to find other solutions and this has to be done. We cannot force our wishes on other countries. We must respect their rights. We must have equitable agreements with other countries.
267970 author: Amy McNabb:  Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner Fischer for his statement, and say to him that on Wednesday of next week we want either President Prodi or Commissioner Byrne to come to Parliament to make a clear statement on what measures the Commission intends to take following the publication of the scientific conclusions later today.  This new Commission must be seen to be acting decisively and if public confidence is not to be eroded we need action within days, not within weeks or months. Therefore I say to Commissioner Fischler that when you have discussions with your colleagues over the weekend, when you look at the scientific conclusions  when you meet as a College on Wednesday  we cannot have prevarication or fudge. We have to have decisive action based on a clear decision that would be taken at the scientific committee later today. Perhaps Mr Parish could send a copy of his speech to his own party leader because sadly in Britain his own party leader has been advocating a ban on French products in the United Kingdom. What we want here, President, is the scientific evidence to prove or disprove the French case and we want an immediate resolution.  We do not want the xenophobia and the jingoism that we have heard on both sides of the English Channel in the last couple of weeks. We want to make sure that farmers and their families are taken care of. We want to make sure that the British beef ban is lifted.  All of the evidence demonstrates that British beef is now the safest in Europe and, we believe, the safest in the world. It was this House, through its special committee of inquiry into BSE, together with the European Commission, that recommended the measures that have now been taken to guarantee the safety throughout the European Union of those who consume British products and British beef.  It is for the future of the European Union, it is for the future of our unity in the World Trade talks in November when we go to Seattle, that we need to have two of Europe s major trading partners resolve this dispute. Can anyone imagine what it will be like when we open the World Trade talks, if there is still a dispute between the French and the British on such a fundamental issue? It will be used by our opponents to divide the European Union in these crucial talks.  I would pay tribute, President, to the National Farmers s Union and to British farmers. This week we had the VicePresident of the National Farmers s Union, Tim Bennett, here. He met my French colleagues from the Socialist Group and he put forward a compelling argument as to why the British beef ban should be lifted. He did not use the gimmicks that we have seen recently: the Liberal Democrat dragging a sack of British beef through the airport, hoping that some hapless customs officer would arrest her for a photo opportunity, or the Tories storming the Bastille two weeks ago in Paris, again for a photo opportunity.  The National Farmers Union came here to meet Parliamentarians and to meet representatives of the Commission because they have a compelling argument. I want to thank those colleagues from Parliament who met representatives and British farmers and listened to that compelling case.  But I say to the Commission that the responsibility being shown by the National Farmers Union can only last for so long. If the Commission does not act next week, if this drags on for more than a few more days, then the argument in Britain will shift. Those people who at the moment have been asking for calm and for no retaliatory action will not be listened to. Inevitably, this issue will escalate and I think it will do permanent damage to British and French relations.  I say to the Commission and I say to this House that over the next few days, we need calm: we do not want a trade war, we do not want an escalating trade ban. We want common sense and we want to base our decision on science because in the disputes that occur in the future  and there will be many on food safety because consumers are so concerned now about the food that they eat  the scientists, the objectivity and the independence of the scientists is absolutely critical. Who knows what issue we will need to refer to that Scientific Committee. It is critical that we base our decisions on the scientific evidence and if there is a clear majority today by the scientists to lift the British beef ban we expect the French authorities to act within days, and we expect the Commission to take the appropriate legal action if that does not happen.  Let me conclude on one final point. The one issue that has been highlighted by this dispute is the fact that we now need a European Food Agency in place as a matter of urgency. I would say to Commissioner Fischler that, when the College meets next Wednesday, please come forward more rapidly with a proposal to establish a European Food Agency because in my view, if that had been in place today, this dispute would never have arisen.
4828032 author: James McNabb:  Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to update Parliament on the developments over the past few days in relation to BSE.  To begin with, I would like to update you on the opinion adopted unanimously by the Scientific Steering Committee last Friday. This opinion was on the scientific grounds of the advice of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) regarding the measures applicable to British beef exports.  I arranged for the summary recommendations of the committee s opinion to be issued to Parliament on Friday together with a copy of my statement to the press. Yesterday, I also arranged for the full copy of the report to be issued to you. However, you may not all have had time to digest their contents and I will, therefore, briefly summarise the main issues.  The opinion addressed in particular three questions from the Commission. These questions can be summarised as follows:  Is there any new evidence in the documentation provided by AFSSA?  Is there a need to reexamine any of the four Scientific Steering Committee opinions directly related to the scientific rationale of the datebased export scheme?  Is the datebased export scheme satisfactory with regard to the safety of meat and meat products concerned?  In its opinion, the scientific steering committee confirmed that there is no need to review the decision to lift the ban on UK beef exports.  Allow me to quote three of the more important conclusions of the committee:  there is clear evidence of the continuing progressive decline in  1999  of BSE in the UK. There is no justification at present to infer any new route of infection ;  the SSC concludes that there are currently no grounds for revising the overall conclusions of the SSC opinions directly related to the rationale of the DBES ; and, finally:  the SSC considers that the measures taken by the UK make any risk to human health from the UK DBES at least comparable to that in other European Member States .  This followed a very thorough examination which focused on the concerns raised by the French authorities. I was greatly encouraged by the unanimous view of the Committee. It has provided the reassurance necessary that the DBES is sufficient to ensure that British beef exports are safe.  And let me be very clear: I have always insisted that the opinion of the committee would be instrumental in determining the Commission s handling of this dispute. I have gone on record several times, including in my hearings before Parliament, that my decisions on food safety will be sciencebased. My priority is to ensure that there is no threat to public health. Sound, independent and excellent scientific advice is essential in this respect.  In this particular case, we now have scientific backing for the existing systems of controls.  It is on this basis that I have called on the French and German authorities to take the committee s opinion into account and lift their national restrictions on imports of British beef. As I said on Friday, these restrictions are no longer necessary in the light of the safeguards in place.  However, we have to accept that this is a highly charged issue where we need to proceed cautiously. This is why I also insisted on Friday that everybody needs a few days to reflect on the full implications of the scientific committee s opinion. My meeting last night with my French and British counterparts was held in this spirit: we need to discuss the best way forward to resolve this dispute.  The French authorities have now requested clarification on five key points. Very briefly, they want further information on traceability, testing, derived products, controls and labelling. I do not consider this request for clarification to be unreasonable. Accordingly, a meeting of officials will take place this Friday to discuss the issues in question.  Let me quote the very short communiqu agreed by all participants last night which agreed this strategy:  We have drawn up a method to emerge from the crisis as quickly as possible by identifying five points  which I have already mentioned  worthy of being looked at by our experts over the next few days. Our experts will begin this work on Friday. We undertake this work in a constructive spirit and a common will to assure public health of our citizens .  I am very surprised at the reaction in the press to last night s developments. It is not a setback. It is not a victory for France or a defeat for the UK. It is simply a further necessary stage in resolving this difficult issue. A few extra days in discussions is a very small price to pay for a successful conclusion. I need not add that the alternative  legal proceedings  would be a far longer and more painful process.  Some additional reassurances or clarifications may be necessary to allow the French authorities to lift their restrictions on UK beef. However, that should not prove to be an insurmountable problem and it is in that spirit that discussions should continue. It is the clear implication of these discussions that the ban will be lifted.  However, I would like to make very clear that there is no question of rewriting the datebased export scheme. It has been upheld by the scientific steering committee as a set of reliable safeguards to ensure that British beef exported under the scheme is safe. It does not need to be changed.  Finally, I will continue to insist on a very quick solution. Let me remind you that today is the very first working day since the adoption of the scientific committee s opinion. We have all worked long and hard over the past several days and these efforts will continue until we have found a solution. I will, of course, continue to keep Parliament fully informed of developments.
2813555 author: Christoph MacLeod:  As you said, the proposal for which I am responsible is that relating to the enforcement of seafarers hours of work on board ships using Community ports.  This is just one element of an overall package of proposals that were brought forward by the Commission last November to try to plug the loopholes of the sectors that were excluded from the original workingtime directive back in  1993 . I hope we are nearing the final chapters in this long saga and that soon we will have all sectors covered by arrangements on working time to protect worker health and safety.  Just as a quick reminder, the batch that was brought forward last year by the Commission included first of all an overall amendment of the  1993  directive, that is the subject of Mrs Smet s report; a directive on road transport, sadly that one is totally blocked in the Transport Council at the moment I understand it; the third, a directive implementing the agreement between the social partners on seafarers, was adopted in the form of a directive in June this year so that element is taken care of, and then finally the proposal that I am speaking on today, a directive on the enforcement of working hours on board ships using Community ports. The three proposals effectively need to be seen together in relation to the one proposal I am speaking on.  There is the agreement reached between the two sides of industry in the maritime sector, there is the specific proposal relating to seafarers having recourse to Community ports, but also there is ILO Convention  180  and in fact the agreement between the two sides of industry in the maritime sector was very closely based on ILO Convention  180 . These three proposals: the agreement, the directive on seafarers hours and the ILO Convention are designed to come into effect together in mid 2002 .  At the first reading on this particular proposal Parliament made no amendments but the rapporter, Hugh McMahon at that time, made the point that it was absolutely essential that these three instruments should come into effect at the same time to avoid any competitive disadvantage. I am therefore very pleased indeed that seems to have been agreed and we seem to be making progress in that direction. The fact that the ILO Convention now has a time limit set down effectively in the form of the other two directives means that we will, I am sure, have sufficient Member States with sufficiently large fleets ratifying the Convention to make sure that it too comes into effect in mid 2002 . The only significant difference in the common position compared with the first reading position is that the implementation date has been put back by one year. That really is to allow Member States to overcome one or two technical difficulties they might have in ratifying ILO Convention  180  and thereby allowing the whole package to be brought into effect at the same time.  Perhaps I could also say that I have just met with the two sides of industry from the maritime sector and congratulated them heartily on the agreement they reached. It took five years of negotiation to reach the agreement in the maritime sector. These things do not happen easily, they do not happen overnight but they did work extremely hard and we are now seeing the fruits of the social dialogue in that particular sector. I think it is very sad indeed that we have not seen similar progress in the road sector.  The difficulties we are now facing in the Transport Council over the legislative proposal the Commission brought forward stem directly from the fact that there was a failure to make progress on a framework agreement on working time in the road sector. It reveals a real sharp contrast to the progress that was made in the maritime sector. That really poses a danger; it poses a danger to the revision to the general directive that Mrs Smet is also dealing with and the danger is this: the rail sector is included in the general directive. The two sides of industry there agreed to be included in the general directive so long as parallel progress was made in the road sector because they quite naturally fear a competitive disadvantage if they put in place wideranging arrangements to cover working time but the road sector does not. I hope the Transport Council will hear that message and that we will see some progress to make sure that road transport is covered, otherwise we see a real danger to the rail sector element of the revision to the general directive.  For now, however, I can thoroughly commend the common position in relation to the enforcement of seafarers hours at work on board ships using Community ports. This will make sure that the workers on board vessels from third countries having recourse to our ports are covered by the same broad arrangements as the agreement between the two sides of industry. It is a perfectly sensible and good proposal and I commend it to the House.
8188132 author: Claire Cameron:  Mr President, I, like my colleagues, would like to congratulate both our rapporteurs on the presentation of their work. Also, as this is the first opportunity I have had, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the House for this debate.  The whole area of working time and the directive have created a lot of difficulties for individual Members and also in Member States. I feel that whilst each of us in this House would welcome the opportunity to ensure a safer working environment, not only for employees, but also for consumers and other users of transport and so on, we have to ensure that we do not overregulate in any individual area. Therefore, my group will be seeking separate votes on certain paragraphs, in particular within the Smet report.  When framing legislation we have an obligation to ensure that legislation is effective, that it can be easily enforced and that it does not impose an onerous burden on employees or enterprises. I feel there are some areas within the present proposals which will create difficulties.  Firstly, with regard to mobile workers, the exclusion of ownaccount operators from the definition will subject this group to the full rigours of the original working time directive. This will mean, for instance, that in the road transport area there will be three categories of operators: ownaccount, third party hauliers and selfemployed.  Secondly, the deletion of mobile workers from Article  17  dilutes the opportunity for mobile workers to extend the reference period from  4  to  12  months.  Thirdly, the proposed sectorspecific directive for working time in road transport, when finalised, will supersede this common position and will provide a more detailed regulatory framework for this area.  In the light of these issues we should be cognisant of the difficulties which will be created. Therefore I am recommending a negative vote in relation to these areas.  There is one further point to bear in mind. The intention of the introduction of this legislation, as I said earlier, was protection of health and safety. However, I have in my possession a study carried out by University College, Dublin, which highlights the negative impact of this proposed extension of the directive, not only on the grounds of safety and competitiveness, but also on the grounds of damage to the environment. The Commission already has a copy of this study. I would welcome a response from it with regard to the points highlighted in it.  I should like to refer very briefly to some of the points highlighted. Firstly, the overall cost of the directive would be far greater than that proposed under the impact assessment. Secondly, the average cost increase for firms in this study would be in excess by about a hundred times that of the study carried out by the EC which stated that it would be  0 . 2 .  The impact of this directive will not be uniform across all sectors of the economy and therefore it will negatively impact on certain sectors, in particular those areas that are more heavily dependent on transport.  Thirdly, it is likely that rather than aligning competition, the application of a single standard across all road transport and other transport areas in some Member States will actually distort competition.  The proposals will also lead to a conflict with other goals with regard to the regulation of traffic to reduce congestion and other impacts.  Finally, we already have in place in the transport sector tachograph requirements which are rigorously enforced in all Member States and which may be one way of dealing with some of the concerns about the health and safety aspect. We should look at modifying and solidifying those tachograph requirements. In Ireland we have a road safety plan which has been in operation since  1998 . This is a fiveyear plan which aims to reduce road deaths, the amount of traffic on the roads and to ensure that the quality of vehicles on the road meet the highest possible standards to protect the environment.  The next point I want to cover is with regard to junior doctors and training. This is an area that has been fraught with danger for the Member States. I believe everybody in this House would welcome the opportunity to give a very positive and assertive vote in favour of the proposals put forward by Mrs Smith in her report with regard to reducing the transitional period to four years. There is no reason why we need a  13 year introduction. Even the common position proposal of  7  years is too long.  Each of us is fully aware that junior doctors in training carry out tasks which are virtually the same as those carried out by their socalled masters , the consultants. Indeed, in  1994  the report commissioned by the European Commission which looked at this whole area of junior doctors in training highlighted seven points which need immediate action: the excessive hours of work in some countries; the question of oncall duties; unrealistic rostering periods; protracted periods of continuous duty; the distribution of duties between junior doctors and senior doctors; informal pressures on doctors in training; the vulnerability of breaks and time off in the face of the pressure of service needed.  I have had several meetings with junior doctors in Ireland over the last number of months with regard to this issue. One of the areas that is of highest concern to them is that because of the existence in Ireland  and in Britain as well, for example  of the archaic feudaltype system whereby junior doctors in training are apprenticed  I use that word broadly  to senior consultants, they are afraid to raise too many issues of concern, because it might affect their future careers. What we have to guarantee is that the proper level of health care and health protection can be given to patients in the health service and also, that junior doctors are given the highest possible level of training with proper standards for their working conditions and working time  this will mean a reduction in the amount of hours that are worked  and also, the other socalled duties which they are obliged to carry out merely to deliver the service. We have a model in Australia and New Zealand which could usefully be copied in the European Union Member States.  Finally, with regard to the concerns of fishermen, special consideration has to be given to this special sector. There is no other sector to which it can be compared. The proposals put forward are unrealistic and impractical. We must ensure that fishermen s rights to earn their living are not hindered by ridiculous regulation.
1825658 author: Michael Finlayson:  Mr President, firstly I should just like to make a technical point. The debate we have here today, which is very welcome, has been part of a long, difficult technical process. First of all we thought we would have a proper resolution and then an oral question; in fact a great many Members signed an oral question. I would hope that their names can be added to whatever resolution comes out of today s debate. We went to a lot of trouble to get colleagues to sign this. I hope that their names will also be listed in the agenda.  I thank the Commissioner for his statement: We demand that the EU listen carefully to the voices of its  90  million children and young people under eighteen. We are concerned that the way in which Europe is developing creates real risks for the safety, protection and wellbeing of its young citizens. Twenty percent of Europe s children live in poverty despite the countries of the EU being amongst the richest in the world.  These are not my words but the words of children and young people from my country, Ireland, and other EU countries. They put it better than I can, how children are excluded from EU policy and how laws and policies that the EU makes have a very real impact on children s lives, an impact that is different from that on adults. Children have a very low priority at European level. The only really serious political response came following the horrific Dutroux affair in Belgium when MEPs were queuing up to sign my resolution on that tragedy. Even then the EU s institutional response has been largely focused on the issue of sexual abuse and trafficking and not on the wider set of EU issues that affect children.  The lack of a clear legal base in the Treaty has meant that children s specific needs are ignored. This week the world celebrates the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the world and the most comprehensive legal statement of children s rights worldwide. Except the US and Somalia, all countries in the world have ratified the Convention; but despite the fact that the EU Member States have ratified it too, the EU institutions themselves have so far failed to implement it.  We have an absurd situation in which Member States have to promote the best interests of the child in legislation and policy, but the Union is under no legal obligation to protect children s best interests. At present children are invisible in EU legislation. Single market considerations often override children s best interests. For example, protection of children and children s safety may be compromised by lack of regulation of services such as Internet and TV advertising. Children are seen as burdens, dependants, victims or barriers to work in direct contradiction to their status in the Convention. The strong focus on the citizen as worker in the Treaty means that the best interests of children are not considered. Children are only a target group in one action programme and very few temporary budget lines. Children and children s projects receive less than EUR  5  million directly from the EU s vast budget. Since the disappearance of the children and family budget line in DG V there is no budget line which has children as a general target group. Children have become invisible in EU policy.  Most fundamentally, there is no coordination and no unit of the Commission, no DirectorateGeneral which takes a lead in developing a coherent, overall policy on children. I am glad to hear you say you are considering it, Commissioner. We look forward to rapid action on this matter.  I would like to make the following recommendations to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention. The Commission should adopt a communication on children s rights to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention and create a children s policy unit. Member States, at the next revision of the Treaties, must adopt a clear legal base on the EU Treaties to promote the best interests of the child. Parliament should ensure that children are more visible in budget lines and the Commission should improve its technique and develop mechanisms for dialogue with the NGOs representing children.
4990997 author: Katarina Whittacker:  I am extremely pleased to be taking part for the first time in a debate in the European Parliament with the High Representative. We are all extremely fortunate that he is the man charged with the key responsibility for developing a more effective and coherent European security and defence policy.  He has, as the House will know, a huge and wholly deserved international reputation for standing up for the values which have been responsible for the best of European history in this century and whose absence has been responsible for the worst of our history as well.  The High Representative and I have spent a good deal of our first weeks in our respective jobs considering together the terrestrial problems  30 , 000  feet below our aircraft seats  so much travel. It reminds me that Lord Grey, the British Foreign Secretary for ten years at the beginning of the century, only ever went abroad once. If my history does not let me down, that visit was shortly followed by the outbreak of the first world war. I suppose Lord Grey was regarded as welltravelled. Perhaps with all the travelling we do these days we are better informed than he was, but perhaps we are not.  I do not wish to repeat all the points which have been so well made by the High Representative, but since you have invited me to take part in this debate, something which I greatly welcome, I should like to say a few words about the Commission s view of the building of a European security and defence policy.  Security and defence, which are at the heart of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, are also properly and inevitably close to the hearts of Member States. As was clearly apparent at the historic meeting  it is the High Representative s adjective and the correct one  at the beginning of this week of the General Affairs Council attended by defence ministers, Member States believe that enhanced cooperation in the security and defence area in the European Union will bring two major benefits. First, it will enable everyone to make better use of their resources and, secondly, it will mean that everyone packs a bigger punch precisely because Member States are working more closely together.  These benefits are needed more than ever in the security field because more is expected of Europe today. More is expected of us by the rest of the world because of our economic success and because of our success too in building peaceful and stable democracies. More is expected of us, in my judgement, by our own citizens, who do not think of Europe just in terms of balance sheets and GDP figures. How could they possibly do so given the tumultuous political events of the last few years  tumultuous events ever since an American political scientist told us that history had ended.  The European Union has to rise to the level of events. It is as simple as that and as difficult as that. The Amsterdam Treaty and the Cologne Declaration represent a formidable challenge. But we, in the Commission, want to play our part in helping to meet it. Of course we have no military role. The sight, on Monday evening, of so many military uniforms in the margins of the General Affairs Council came as an interesting cultural development. But what we do have in the Commission is the means and the experience to make an important contribution to the nonmilitary dimension of security. The socalled Petersberg Tasks suggest a comprehensive package of crisismanagement measures where Community instruments can interact with traditional diplomacy and, if necessary, the use of military force.  Here we come to a crucial point. Sometimes the military dimension is essential and decisive. But the nonmilitary dimension can also be crucial. After all, the nature of conflict has changed so radically during this bloody century. Eightyfive percent of the victims of the first world war were soldiers. Only  15  were civilians. The situation in conflicts today is almost the opposite. It is equally the case that with the increasing sophistication and interdependence of our societies, economic measures, the free flow of information and so on have become ever more important in conflict and its prevention. So the European Union has to envisage action right across the whole range of instruments at its disposal, both military and nonmilitary.  If you want to know just what we can contribute as a Community, look at the multitude of our operations in the Balkans. We are involved in obvious areas like humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and reconstruction. But the measures we can take with the aim of preventing conflict and human suffering include many other things as well, like law enforcement, institutionbuilding and trade policy. Those are the sort of things we are supporting in Kosovo, to which we will be pledging at the donors conference in Brussels today another contribution of EUR  500  million from the Community.  So what I want to make clear is that you do not have to strain or stretch your imagination, let alone strain or stretch the Treaties which determine our activities, to see the absolutely clear roles that can be played by the Commission and by Parliament. It is not just in southeast Europe that we have seen the need for coordinated military and civil crisis management both at Union level and between Member States. We can also see that in East Timor. We have to improve our ability as a Union and as Member States to manage crises and to contribute to those international organisations which are also active in this, alas, all too necessary area.  The Helsinki European Council will discuss an integrated approach to conflict management and we are, as a Commission, making a full contribution to that discussion. Let me make a point that some may regard as rather prosaic. In conflict prevention and crisis management, time is of the essence. The new Commission has begun work to try to improve the effectiveness and speed of response of the instruments that we have in crisis situations. That is something which Parliament has frequently requested us to do, and absolutely rightly. It is a big job. In many respects, any progress we make in this area would represent by far the biggest contribution that I could make to our rather more heroic objectives.  I hope that we can count on the continued support of Parliament in developing more flexible and more rapid procedures, and as the High Representative I am sure would readily agree, I lose no opportunity to make the same point to the Council.  The Commission s role in crisis management is clear, but our role goes beyond crisis management. A European security and defence policy cannot be developed in the absence of a competitive and open European defence industrial and technological base. This is also in the interests of the European Union s partners. We in the Commission can contribute to this with a range of instruments in areas such as public procurement, the internal market, research and competition.  I want to make one final point. Sometimes people talk about the potential institutional conflicts in the foreign and security tasks which lie ahead. I hope they will not take exception to these remarks but I think that the issues they are talking about are too important to allow them to get mangled by diplomatic lawyers. Plainly, we have to build on the institutional framework of the Union. Plainly, military and nonmilitary matters cannot be neatly compartmentalised. Plainly, the Commission must play its full part in crisis management even when there is a military component, because there will also be a nonmilitary component. Plainly, the new structures must enable the Commission to exercise its full right of initiative. Plainly, the Commission is not a college of amateur chiefs of staff and plainly, we want to work successfully with the High Representative and with Parliament to ensure that Europe has the security and defence policy that it needs and that its citizens want. And if there is another plainly left in the dictionary, it is this: so long as I have my present responsibilities, no cigarette paper, or perhaps after David Byrne s announcement on tobacco yesterday I should say no piece of tissue paper, is going to separate the Commissioner for External Relations from the High Representative.
8147147 author: Victor Merx:  Madam President, I believe, as the other speakers have said, that this is a significant formal occasion today, because we have for the first time in plenary the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. It has been said that he has three jobs but only one salary. But an even greater marvel is that he has three such great, large, heavy hats and only one head to wear them on. High Representative, we wish you every success in this task.  As regards your role, we hope, above all, that you may contribute to closing the gap between the aspirations and reality of European foreign policy. The challenge that you undertake is at the core of what we do. To take an example, in  1992  we as a Union drew up the Petersberg Tasks which offered comprehensive nonmilitary and military security options. The aspirations set out in those Tasks were perhaps most rudely challenged by Kosovo where the gap between aspirations and reality was cruelly exposed by an absence of an appropriate operational substance. The highest priority for you now is to begin to give operational content and meaning to both the nonmilitary and military challenges of Petersberg, not least, given the several hats you wear, particularly the military ones.  My own group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is strongly committed to the general concept of developing a capacity for autonomous European action which correctly has been identified as a rapid response capability with the necessary logistical support. This will perhaps require some reallocation of resources. This issue of cost will have to become a parallel priority in our debates. We are committed to a capability for autonomous EU action in my group. We are somewhat sceptical about the degree to which this should be autonomous of transatlantic relations. In so far as you have dealt with the issue in broad transatlantic terms, my group welcomes strongly that emphasis.  A second point I would like to raise is the question of the European Union and the coordination of our aid policies and our foreign policies. I should like to say to both Mr Solana and Mr Patten that there is an enormous challenge to bring greater political coherence to this task. The Union or its Member States account for half of all the world s humanitarian aid and half of all international development aid. The Union gives threefifths of all aid to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. But we have nothing like a proportionate say and influence in terms of foreign policy. This is a core challenge that we look to you and to the Commission to resolve in terms of foreign policy.  If we develop this operational capacity through the Petersberg Tasks, if we develop more coherence in aid and foreign policy, how can we then adopt more coherent policies in international fora? We have a great density of institutional relations  we have touched on some of them in the debate already. In particular, I want to signal on behalf of my group an interest in the nondebate that waxes and wanes every so often about the reform of the UN Security Council. Without prejudice to the arrangements in existing Member States, it is a question that we must look at in due course. If we are really to have a nonmilitary as well as military capacity, an effective voice at the Security Council table would be important especially in our outreach beyond Europe itself. This is therefore something we would put down as a marker.  In his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Solana talked about having a less declaratory and more active foreign policy. We agree wholeheartedly with that, and I would say one of the tests that we would have in the back of our minds as a group is this: in five years time will we have exported stability to southeastern Europe, or will we still be importing the consequences of instability? This is for us a core challenge.  Today is the tenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia as it then was. I hope, Mr Solana, that you will use your role to give an added sense of political urgency to the task of enlargement, rather than to promote procrastination. I hope that you will use your voice to teach the lessons to be learned from the former Yugoslavia. It is an ambitious, difficult task. We wish you well. You will have the full support and goodwill of my group.
871336 author: Frederic Finlayson:  Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, on his outstanding efforts in forging a broad crossparty approach to this hugely important issue, which will have consequences for us all for many years to come.  The ELDR remains unambiguously supportive of further trade liberalisation, of the strengthening of the multilateral trade system and of a broadly based negotiation covering a wide range of existing and new trade matters. Our hope is that this report, when adopted by Parliament tomorrow, will serve as a clear signal of our political backing for a comprehensive round at a crucial stage in the preparations for Seattle.  This Parliament also has a central role in allaying legitimate public fears about the consequences of globalisation. In some quarters a misplaced view has arisen that the WTO is a malign agent for all the negative effects of globalisation. In truth, without the WTO we would be unable to construct the global legal and regulatory architecture which is indispensable to any coherent political response to globalisation. Without the WTO the law of the jungle and the power of might over right would prevail  hardly an outcome the critics of the WTO would welcome.  For these reasons we have been active in tabling a series of amendments to the report, pushing for the development of new WTO rules in areas such as the environment, now directly affected by international trade policy. We have supported all efforts to strengthen the place of developing countries in the world trade system, not least by underlining the inescapable need for continued reform of the EU s common agricultural policy.  We have also pushed, and will continue to do so, to ensure the WTO is more transparent and the European Commission more accountable to the European Parliament in the conduct of trade policy. This must include, as a minimum, an automatic Parliamentary right to subject any WTO deal to assent and much greater access to the negotiating briefs discussed within the Council. At the same time the ELDR has resisted all attempts to burden this report with a shopping list of sectorspecific requests. That is why tomorrow we will vote against those sections of the report which call for exceptional treatment for particular sectors. We must accept the consequences of our support for a comprehensive trade round. Comprehensive means allencompassing; it does not mean riddled with exceptions.  Finally, a word on China. Late on Sunday night a bilateral deal was struck between the US and China on China s accession to the WTO. China s entry into the WTO will, arguably, have as farreaching an effect as anything which will take place in Seattle. It is impossible to separate the question of China s accession to the WTO from our wider consideration of the EU s position in Seattle.  The EU is in a delicate position as the last major WTO player not to have concluded a deal with China. An optimistic interpretation would suggest that Europe is now in a strong position to exploit and build on the concessions already secured from China by Washington. However, the fact that European Commission negotiating officials were reported a mere week before the US deal as discounting the likelihood of Chinese accession any time soon may suggest that the European Union has not been negotiating as convincingly as might be hoped. There is clearly a risk that Europe will now be forced into a corner in the talks with China.  The ELDR has always strongly supported Chinese accession to the WTO but not at the cost of legitimate European interests, which do not always converge with American commercial interests. I therefore call on the Commission to give an urgent account of the Chinese accession talks to Parliament, and particularly as to how they may affect our preparations for Seattle, so that Parliament can vote tomorrow on Mr Schwaiger s report in full command of all the relevant facts.  With these important caveats in mind, I would like to confirm the ELDR s broad support for Mr Schwaiger s work and reiterate our warm thanks to him.
1326318 author: Christoph Merx:  First of all, I would like to say to the honourable Members that in the view of the Commission, the EURODAC Regulation is instrumental to the implementation of the Dublin Convention which determines which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States. The Tampere European Council has called for work on EURODAC to be concluded rapidly, and the Commission considers in fact that EURODAC is an important instrument.  If governments and citizens can be confident that we have effective arrangements in place to decide which state is responsible for considering an asylum claim and to tackle the problem of multiple asylum applications, it will make easier our task of promoting high and fair standards of asylum.  Once the EURODAC Regulation has been adopted, it will be incumbent upon the Council to make similar progress in respect of other asylum instruments. I, myself, will shortly unveil a proposal for a legal basis for the European Fund for Refugees. This will provide financial assistance from the Community budget for the reception, the integration and the voluntary return of refugees, displaced persons and asylumseekers which is a relevant instrument to give a human dimension to the asylum policy of the Union, as one Member of the House requested just a few moments ago.  I shall also be unveiling a proposal for an instrument on asylum procedures after we have received the opinion of Parliament on our working document towards common standards on asylum procedures. I shall also unveil a new proposal on temporary protection which will draw on our experiences during the Kosovo crisis. Progress on the EURODAC Regulation must be accompanied by real progress in other areas so that we can gradually attain our goal of creating a common European asylum system. A proposal which provides for the systematic fingerprinting of asylum seekers and certain other categories of third country nationals clearly raises sensitive and difficult issues. We therefore need to ensure the highest standards of fairness and transparency for all those affected by the regulation. In particular the most rigorous of data protection standards are required.  When we converted the EURODAC Convention and Protocol into a Community Regulation, we amended it to bring it fully into line with Community law on data protection including the new Treaty Article  286  on data protection arrangements for the Community Institutions. It is up to the authority provided for in Article  286  to ensure the appropriate and adequate use of these data and the application of Community rules.  We also introduced new provisions on monitoring and evaluation under which the Commission will report regularly to the Parliament and to the Council on the concrete functioning of EURODAC.  I am grateful to the Committee on Citizens Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and to their rapporteur, Mr Pirker, for the report on the EURODAC Regulation. The report contains a number of useful amendments which I believe will help us to improve the text of the Regulation.  The Commission can accept amendment No  1  to avoid the term alien and instead refer to third country nationals, although we will have to make it clear that the Regulation also covers stateless persons. We can also accept amendment No  2  to the title which introduces a reference to the Dublin Convention. We can also accept the principle of amendment No  6  which makes it clear that there is only a match if fingerprints are identical and not if they are just similar, and we accept also the principle of amendment No  12  which is intended to make it clear that data must never be sent to an asylum applicants country of origin or used within a Member State for an unrelated purpose. I take this opportunity to assure Mrs Terrn i Cus that illegal immigrants fingerprints are only used for the specific purpose of the Dublin Convention  which means for analysis  if they have requested a demand for asylum in another Member State.  The two issues which have been of most concern to the Parliament are the minimum agelimit for fingerprinting and the rules on erasure of data from the central database.  On the minimum agelimit my approach is to stick to the compromise minimum agelimit of  14  years which was agreed in previous negotiations, but to accept your amendment which makes it clear that fingerprinting must be carried out in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Migratory movements of people seeking protection unfortunately involve minors. We need to ensure that our arrangements for determining responsibility for asylum applications take account of this reality.  In addition, the agelimit of  14  years was a compromise reached after difficult negotiations. I do not want to reopen the discussion and risk ending up with an even less acceptable solution.  As far as the rules on erasure of data are concerned, the amendments approved by the Committee on Citizens Rights provide for the erasure of data as soon as anyone covered by the regulation has obtained legal status. I can accept this in relation to people who are apprehended irregularly crossing the external border of the European Union and who are fingerprinted under Article  8  of the regulation. Indeed, the intention behind the current text is that this data should be erased as soon as the person concerned obtains any kind of residence permit. This would include someone who has been admitted as a refugee or under a subsidiary form of protection.  I cannot go that far in relation to data on asylum applicants, but I can accept some of the amendments that have been put forward. If we were to erase all data on asylum applicants as soon as they were granted any kind of legal status, EURODAC would no longer cover situations where an asylum applicant is granted permission to remain in some other capacity for a short time and, at the end of this period, moves to another Member State and claims asylum there. But I can accept the amendment which provides that data on asylum applicants should be erased when the person concerned is recognised as a refugee.  Some Member States consider that a problem arises if people who have been recognised as a refugee in one Member State travel to another Member State and claim asylum there. They have therefore argued that data on recognised refugees should be blocked in the central unit so that statistical data can be compiled to measure the scale of the phenomenon.  I believe that we should take a different approach. If people who have been recognised as refugees in one Member State seek asylum in another Member State this is likely to be because refugees do not enjoy the right to reside in a Member State other than the one in which they were recognised as such. We should seek to remedy this by including refugees within the scope of an instrument defining the circumstances in which a third country national who is legally resident in one Member State may reside in another Member State. I therefore agree that we should now provide that data on recognised refugees should be erased from EURODAC.  Finally, the regulation will not apply to Denmark. This results directly from Denmarks protocol to the Treaty. The Commission does not consider that EURODAC is a measure to build on the Schengen acquis under Article B of the Danish protocol. We understand that Denmark nevertheless may wish to participate in EURODAC, but it remains to be seen what legal formula could be adopted in that case.  The amendments which I propose to accept will strengthen the text of the regulation and I am very grateful to Parliament for the important contribution it has made.
8835722 author: Sarah Brown:  The Commission will of course be present during the debate this afternoon, but I will not be there personally.  Despite considerable efforts to prevent drug abuse and addiction the drug problem continues to pose threats and challenges on the eve of the year  2000 . The most serious health problems are caused by the use of opiates and, in particular, heroin, amphetamines and multidrug use. Cannabis is still the most commonly used illicit drug in the Union. Infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C have reached high prevalence amongst intravenous drug users. Organised crime plays an increasingly dominant role in drug production and trafficking. We have to respond to these challenges.  I should also extend my sincerest gratitude to Parliament, particularly to the Committee on Citizens Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the rapporteur, Mrs GiannakouKoutsikou, for the quality of their work and the speed with which they have commended the Commissions communication on combating drugs for the period  2000  to  2004 . This will allow the Helsinki European Council to adopt an efficient strategy against this disturbing phenomenon.  The main general targets for the European Unions strategy against drugs for the next five years can be summarised as follows: to reduce significantly the prevalence of illicit drug use among young people under  18  years of age; to reduce substantially the number of drugrelated deaths; to increase considerably the number of successfully treated addicts and to reduce substantially the number of serious drugrelated crimes, including money laundering and illicit traffic in precursors.  In the field of demand reduction, preventive measures and programmes for children and young people should, instead of focusing exclusively on illegal drugs, address addiction in general, including aspects of alcohol and tobacco use. Training of professionals from social, health, education and law enforcement sectors is a prerequisite for effective action.  In the field of supply reduction, the emergence of new synthetic drugs makes it necessary to find ways to respond quickly to the appearance of new substances and consumption trends. The establishment of voluntary monitoring mechanisms for new chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs, as well as enhanced cooperation with trade, will constitute the major priorities in this area. Efforts to curb money laundering have to be intensified through the rapid adoption and subsequent implementation of the recently proposed amendment to the money laundering directive. Following the Tampere European Council, priority has to be given to the prevention of juvenile, urban and drugrelated delinquency and to the progressive harmonisation of European Union legislation on illicit drug trafficking.  In the past, Member States and the Commission have given insufficient priority to the evaluation of antidrugs activities. This must change. Evaluation must become an integral part of the European Union approach. The Commission has already begun this evaluation and hopes to do more in the future. The observatory in Lisbon can contribute by issuing guidelines for the evaluation of demand and supply reduction activities.  The implementation of five harmonised key indicators  demand for treatment by drug users, drugrelated deaths, mortality and causes of death among drugusers, the incidence of drugrelated infectious diseases, the comparability of surveys of drug use, behaviour and attitudes towards drugs in the general population and finally, the comparability of the prevalence estimates of problem drug use  plays an important role in this context.  Adoption of the European Union drugs strategy for the first years of the new millennium is not the end of the debate. I understand that the coming Portuguese presidency will implement the European Union drugs strategy through the presentation of more concrete priorities for the years  20002004 . We will, as well, have the possibility of working together with European institutions on the organisation of an interinstitutional conference to discuss the implementation of the European Union drugs strategy, possibly at the beginning of next year. I hope that on that occasion we will be able to evaluate the interpillar Council meeting that has been suggested by the rapporteur.  The Commissions communication represents, in my opinion, a good starting point for a global, multidisciplinary and integrated European strategy to fight illicit drugs on the line that was approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in  1998 .  The observatory in Lisbon and Europol in The Hague are two important instruments that can contribute significantly to our strategy. I am, therefore, confident that we have the potential and will find the political will to respond to the new challenges in the perspective of the  20002004  European Union drugs strategy.
4445281 author: Helen McNabb:  I shall answer briefly the three points which have been raised: capital punishment, the minorities in Kosovo and the Nikitin case.  Firstly, as regards the matter of capital punishment, I would like to devote a few words not to the substance of the question, which you deal with in your draft resolution and which, plainly, meets with the approval of the Commission as far as the position adopted on capital punishment is concerned. This does not, I feel, merit extensive comment, as we are in agreement on this point. What I wish to bring up is a specific point which was mentioned in the course of the discussion, i.e. the matter of the draft resolution on capital punishment which the Union proposed to the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  This is, in fact, a matter of foreign policy. By means of this resolution, the European Union was proposing to the international community that it undertake to establish a moratorium on capital punishment. Indeed, as far as we are concerned, the abolition of capital punishment is an intrinsic part of our human rights policy, whereas for many countries this is exclusively a matter of criminal law, or so they claim, at least.  We did indeed withdraw this draft resolution, on mature reflection, and this decision is presented for your evaluation. We withdrew it because the debates in this Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations were, in our opinion, going badly. In fact, we felt that some of the many amendments submitted by the countries for whom our position is a problem are, in our view, unacceptable, particularly the amendment to introduce into the resolution a reference to article  2 , paragraph  7  of the United Nations Charter, in the terms of which, Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorise the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state. This amendment was indeed inconvenient, insofar as it shifted the debate into another sphere, that of the national jurisdiction of a state. As far as we were concerned, the inclusion in the resolution of a reference specific to the principle of sovereignty of states would have entailed a risk of challenging the body of legislation in the system of the United Nations, and, in particular, of the World Conference of  1993 , which said that the promotion and protection of human rights was a legitimate concern of the international community.  Moreover, accepting an amendment of this kind could have had a very negative impact on the work of the United Nations in the human rights field. It was not therefore, as I have heard, in order to yield to some sort of pressure that we preferred to close the debate in this way, at least for the time being, but rather in order to maintain a position of principle. You must not, therefore, see this decision as indicative of a lack of a foreign policy, or that we caved under pressure, but of the Union s assessment of the risk, considering the proposed amendments, of finding ourselves, for the sake of the legitimate campaign we share, some way behind the positions we have gained earlier. This is the explanation I wished to give you.  I shall now come to the second subject, Mr President, regarding the rights of the Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo. I believe that the Commission and, with it, the entire European Union has made it clear, from the start, that we condemn any sort of ethnic violence, regardless of who is inflicting and who is suffering it. Such violence is just as unacceptable today against the Serbian and Gypsy minorities as it was when it was inflicted upon the Kosovars several months before. Thanks to programmes of assistance in democratisation and human rights, the Commission continues to provide support for measures intended to reestablish confidence and to promote dialogue between the different communities. We were already active in this way, without much success, unfortunately, even before the conflict, and I share, from this point of view, the suggestions that some of you made that we must all meticulously take stock of the situation. From now on, in the new circumstances, we are nonetheless trying pragmatically to continue to act according to these objectives, particular in selecting aid and assistance projects.  We support fully and absolutely the action undertaken by KFOR to maintain law and order in Kosovo and to protect all the citizens. In addition, we support fully and absolutely the action undertaken by MINUK in order to set up an operational civil administration, capable of taking on the police functions which are currently handled by KFOR, and to create a peaceful multiethnic society, capable of taking on both the reconstruction of Kosovo and the restoration of its society. MINUK approached the Commission with regard to the financing of the Kosovo protection force and the Member States shall take a decision, in the weeks to come, regarding the programme we suggested in response to this request. We are also offering our support, in the form of twinning, to the actions agreed by MINUK at local administration level. In this context, we are asking all people of goodwill in Kosovo and outside, to also work towards these objectives in order to help us to ensure that MINUK and KFOR achieve them themselves. I may remind you, if you need reminding, that we are opposed to Kosovo being partitioned. It must become a multiethnic society, without distinctions or discrimination for ethnic or other reasons.  And if I may switch to English for convenience without breaching the rules of this House, I will answer that the European Commission has been following very closely and with a great degree of concern Alexander Nikitins trial. Representatives of EU Member States attended the court session in St Petersburg in October  1998  and were present when the Supreme Court delivered its latest decision in February  1999  to send back the case to the lower court for further investigation.  In line with previous statements, the European Commission has made it clear that any further judicial proceedings regarding the contribution made by Mr Nikitin to the Bellona report should be in full conformity with internationally agreed principles and standards of justice and human rights. I am aware that Mr Nikitins lawyers have lodged an application to the European Court of Human Rights and I am certain the Council of Europes institutions will pursue this application accordingly.  While respecting the judicial procedures of a sovereign country, the European Commission will remain vigilant to ensure that Mr Nikitin is granted an impartial and public trial based on the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Russian Constitution.
4189364 author: Helen Finlayson:  Mr President and Commissioner, in introducing this report on the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms, I can be confident that the proposals are based on sound scientific advice. As my European Parliament colleagues will know, the Fisheries Committee has been a strong supporter of technical conservation measures based on technical and scientific data.  This is particularly so where efforts are made to crossreference scientific data with fisheries observations. Fishermen spend more time at sea than scientists and the sea is their natural environment, which they observe on a daily basis. They have a better understanding of fish movements and factors affecting fish stocks than people give them credit for, quite simply because it is essential for their livelihood. The House will recall the positive opinion on the substance of the measures and resolution of  25  October  1996 , the Gallagher report, and its opinion of  26  April  1998  on the implementation of technical measures in the common fisheries policy. On  30  March  1998 , the Council of Ministers adopted Regulation  85098  for the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles. This regulation replaced  89497  with the exception of Articles  11 ,  19  and  20  which related to driftnets and which were dealt with separately.  After the adoption and publication of this regulation, data brought to the attention of the Commission necessitated its incorporation into this regulation. The regulation of  13  March  1998  is due to come into effect on  1  January next year. However, it is imperative that the additional data and developments which have come too late be incorporated in this regulation and ensure that it is part of the regulation coming into force on  1  January. The present proposal for a Council regulation provides for changes to the area and timing of restrictions designed to protect the spawning of the Douglas Bank herring in the Irish Sea. In view of the current healthy state of herring stocks, the proposal changes allow for a reduction in both the area and the time period of fishing restrictions. This will increase fishing opportunities while, at the same time, protecting the stocks and ensure that there is no repeat of the collapse of the stocks which we recall in  1970 .  I am pleased to note that the scientific, technical and economic committee have supported the proposal, having examined the report of the advisory committee of fisheries management during its November  1999  session, in addition to the specific provisions on the use of Danish seine nets in the plaice box. This merely corrects an oversight in the original text. The conditions agreed within the international dolphin conservation programme for the use of purse seines which commonly will apply provisionally within the Community incorporate into this regulation a revision of mesh size for two species of spotted dogfish. Technical conservation measures will play an important role in the conservation of stocks by protecting juvenile fish and will reduce the threat to further yields.  A clear message must go out from this Parliament, from the Commission and from the Council to the fishing industry that honest endeavours will be respected and those fishermen who abide by technical conservation measures that are devised by accredited European scientists in partnership with fishermen will benefit most. If amendments are necessary in the light of new developments, no doubt the Commission will come back with further proposals and I am quite certain that the Committee and Parliament will respond expeditiously.  I want to thank my colleagues, the officials in committee and the officials in the Commission for their assistance in drawing up this report and I want to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estvez on the presentation of her very comprehensive report. But I must say that I am disappointed here today that the Council have already decided and that we are debating a report when a decision has been taken.  I must pose the question: are we ordering our business in a correct fashion? Commissioner Fischler told us we had no coresponsibility, but that our views would be taken into consideration. How can our views be taken into consideration when we are debating a report which has already been decided on by Council? I would sincerely hope the Council and the Commission have taken note of our views.  They were obviously monitoring the progress of this report through the committee, and I am pleased that they have rejected a proposal to allow unlimited quantities of herring into the Union, quantities of fresh, chilled and frozen herring at preferable rates of duty. Now it has been restricted from  2001  to  20   000  tonnes. It is still too much in view of the fact that the prices of herring in the Community at the moment are at an alltime low. This is because of the overloading of the EU market with lowprice fish and frozen herring from Norway and the setting up by German companies of lowcost production units in Poland for processing dutyfree Norwegian fish for export to Germany. We must remember, we have a duty and a responsibility to the Community fishermen and we must ensure that their rights are protected.
3289982 author: Katarina LaCourt:  Mr President, I shall try to comment on all the interesting contributions to this debate. Some have commented that Parliament must be the first to receive the material the Court produces, be it our annual report or the special reports we produce throughout the year. Let me make an unequivocal and clear statement that this is absolutely the rule we shall obey, that this Assembly will be the first to receive our reports.  If I may add one thing immediately to the point made by Mr Poms Ruiz: I entirely agree with him that you must make very special requirements of a Court of Auditors, that it must be like Caesars wife. But what has happened in this case is that the Court has found out who was guilty of leaking the draft annual report to the press, and has taken the appropriate measures. All of us know that this is not the only time that information on classified material has been passed on. What has happened hitherto is that the Court has established this. I hope we can continue to do the same in every case but I would not deny, as President of the Court of Auditors, that special demands could be put on us as a result.  Many speakers have pointed out the responsibility of Member States. I can only confirm that this is a positive response to the challenge of Member States willingness to fight fraud, to put their house in order, to enhance control systems, a challenge that we have pointed out in the annual report may be even greater this year, while not for one minute diminishing the role and the responsibility of the Commission in this context. The Commission must, at the same time, dare to impose clear demands and requirements on the Member States control systems.  Ms Morgan asked me a clearcut question: is there something specific in this annual report that should make Parliament not grant discharge? Let me underline what the Courts role is in this context: it is to give you all the material we find it appropriate and advisable to put forward, and leave it to you to make the political decision on discharge.  I will only say that the question that needs to be asked is whether the Commission has done everything in its power to remedy the shortcomings that have been pointed out. I would certainly not make any specific detailed remark on any one point. It is the overall material that has been produced both in this annual reports and in the special report we have produced, and will produce, that should be the basis for Parliaments decision on this point.  I would underline what Mrs van der Laan pointed out concerning fraud in the Union, and would point out that, judging from press reports about fraud in general and attacks on public budgets, you would think the European budget was more vulnerable than any.  This is, of course, not true. What has been stated many times is that this is a problem that all countries, both in their regional and national budgets, have to fight.  May I take this opportunity to point out that the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato and myself addressed jointly a contact committee of all the presidents of Member States national audit offices and the Court of Auditors, just to point out to these key people that fighting fraud in European funds is also a national task. This is a clear example of Parliament and the Court of Auditors working to draw this to the attention of the Member States.  I agree with Mr Staes that this is no bedtime reading and I was very worried when they started to put out the lights, but because of Mr DellAlbas courageous intervention this was stopped.  I would also stress that the work undertaken in constructing OLAF has to be continued. In the Courts special report on the UCLAF activities we have pointed to a number of proposals that we think both Parliament and Member States should undertake, concerning a European prosecutor and other measures to continue the fight against fraud.  To Mrs Eriksson I would say that it has been customary for me to speak English. This is the first time I have spoken in Parliament. I am making my maiden speech, just like Mr van Hulten. My speaking English has to do with the fact that we have English and French as working languages. When I was to begin this speech, I was far too nervous to dare to express myself in the language of honour and chivalry. I nonetheless believe that I should have managed if I had really put my mind to it.  I think that, following a habit already established in the Budgetary Control Committee, I will stick to my second language and I hope that you will forgive me for this national treason.  Mr Bsch, I agree with you and I think everybody agrees with you that there are special requirements to be placed on those parts of the budget which are managed by the Commission itself.  I have already underlined that it is important that the Commission should also shoulder its responsibility concerning the Member States; but when it comes to internal policies, external aid and personnel administration, we can put clearer demands on the Commission and we can also deal with it differently when it comes to the statement of assurance, something which we have started to do and will continue to do.  I congratulate Mr van Hulten on his first speech here. I agree with him as regards the need in our work to reassure taxpayers that their money is being spent well and I also underline, as Mrs van der Laan has done, the need for Member States also to fight fraud.  Mr Schori asked me about my conclusions, or the conclusions of the Court of Auditors, concerning events in the Stockholm representation of the Commission. I have two reflections to make; one being that this shows that the only way to cope with problems of this kind is to have functioning internal control systems. There has to be, whenever expenditure of European money is concerned, an internal control system which is efficient and reliable so that the external controller can ascertain whether systems function and not go through every detail of administration. The other is that I have also publicly stated that this is a test case for the Commissions willingness to reform its disciplinary procedures, of which we are very critical and which I know that the Commission also intends to do something about.  I have already pointed out in my first speech the same problem that Mr Blak brought up  that staff administration has to be improved. As for Mrs Eriksson, who asked me why we do not audit the European Investment Fund, we asked the Council when it was established whether we should do so and the reply was no and that is why. I do not agree with the Council but it is the Council that decides.  Finally, I will make a general comment on what Mrs Schreyer pointed out in her speech. As you can hear, the attitude of the Commission to this annual report is to take it to its heart and to start embarking upon the reform programme we are discussing today.  Let me say, on behalf of the European Court of Auditors, that we hope that we can, in a climate of dialogue and openness, work together to see to it that this new Commission can carry out the reform that we are eagerly looking forward to.
2944402 author: Frederic Finlayson:  I should like to thank the Committee on the Environment and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Hulthn, for its careful consideration of the common position.  Many of the amendments are designed to accelerate the phaseout schedules for HCFCs and methyl bromide, an objective which the Commission certainly shares in the light of their significant and increasing contribution to ozone depletion.  European SMEs which are leading in the development of the alternatives have proved that rapid phaseout of remaining ozone depleting substances promotes sustainable industries and additional ozone layer protection.  Complex negotiations in the Council led to the adoption of an acceptable common position last February. Its quick adoption is the Commissions priority. The Commission cannot go as fast as it would like in some issues, as we are rapidly approaching some of the proposed phaseout dates. It is important to avoid the introduction of the new ozone depleting substances. Amendment No  27  would introduce an expedited procedure for adding new ozone depleting substances to the regulation, which would be useful in deferring unwise investments while benefiting the ozone layer. The Commission can therefore accept this amendment in principle.  Amendment No  9  is also acceptable since it allows timelimited extensions for the use of very small quantities of CFCs in a specialised type of medical devices for pain relief. Other amendments that the Commission accepts, either totally, in principle or in part, are Amendments Nos  1 ,  4 ,  11 ,  12 ,  15 ,  17 ,  24 ,  25 ,  26 ,  29 ,  31 ,  32  and  35 . The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos  2  and  10  as they would bring forward the first cuts in production and use of methylbromide to unrealistically early dates   1  January  2000  and  1  January  2001  respectively. This would cause procedural difficulties and problems for farmers.  Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No  3  which would remove any exemptions beyond  2006 . This would penalise individual farmers or certain crops disproportionally.  Strict controls on HCFC production and trade with nonparties to the Montreal Protocol are part of the Community ozone policy. Two weeks ago, in the Beijing meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Community succeeded in introducing such measures into the Protocol. However, excessively harsh measures going beyond the common position could shift the market to overseas producers.  Amendments Nos  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8  and  23  advancing the phaseout schedule and imposing an immediate trade ban cannot therefore be accepted.  There are several amendments that bring forward the controls on HCFC uses. The current position represents a careful balance between what is environmentally desirable, technically feasible and economically achievable. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos  13 ,  14  and  16  which would tighten the deadlines further for the phasing out of HCFC use in solvents, air conditioning and polyurethane foams. This could bring increased problems and lead to cash flow problems for companies.  The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos  18  and  34  on the possible use of HCFCs as a replacement to halons in fire fighting. Expanding it is unnecessary and limiting it is of little, if any, practical consequence. Such changes would affect a crucial part of the common position compromise.  Amendment No  28  relates to Article  5  and bans the use of CFCs and HCFCs as a processing agent immediately in a specific application. The Commission cannot accept this amendment because there is a need to provide for transitional time for phaseout. Nor can the Commission accept Amendment No  19  banning sales of used HCFCcontaining equipment within five years after the respective use ban as it would increase the probability of illegal dumping and venting of HCFCs to the atmosphere.  While the Commission has sympathy for Amendment No  20  that would ban the production of HCFCcontaining products for export over the three years after respective domestic use ban, we have to maintain the balance between environmental desirability and the risk that manufacturing would relocate elsewhere. The Commission cannot therefore accept it.  Similarly, while we support the intention of Amendment No  21 , it would be incompatible with the exemption in Article  5 ( 6 ) for specific cases and therefore cannot be accepted. Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No  22  as exemptions would in any case be granted in full consultation with Member States, and thus it cannot accept it.  The Commission cannot accept Amendment No  30  which seeks to expand the possibilities to grant exemptions for substances that have already been phased out. It is important to send the unambiguous message that when a substance is phased out no further exemptions should be allowed except those that qualify as essential uses.  Finally, may I thank Parliament for its work and careful consideration of the common position.
8172290 author: Michael Cameron:  I do not know about you, but its seems to me that this evening is rather reminiscent of the Titanic. I have a horrible feeling that the whole ship is sinking. I hope that I am not right, but if we go on like this, perhaps we should join in a chorus of Nearer my God to Thee, standing in the middle and singing it.  I hope, when the Commission replies, that the Commissioner will be kind enough to reply to the debate in English. It is extremely helpful when he does so, because this is an issue where a number of us have constituents who are very anxious to find out what is going on, and it is extremely helpful if he can reply in English if at all possible.  This is a deeply unsatisfactory issue dealt with unsatisfactorily by the Commission. Parliaments Environment Committee has put together a short resolution in order that Members can debate it with the Commission and we can attempt to get some clarification from them. It is unsatisfactory in the approach that the Commission has had to adopt and indeed in the content of the proposal coming before us. What we are doing this evening is commenting on a draft Commission regulation. There is no chance for the European Parliament to propose amendments to it through our normal procedures. We can only object and if we do object, that would hold up agreement. We do not really want to hold up such agreement, so we are taking this opportunity of having this debate.  We underline in the motion before you that we believe that this kind of issue should be dealt with in future through the codecision procedure. In fact, members of the committee find that the whole European Union approach to genetically modified food at the moment is in a rather confused state. Indeed we have a number of Commissioners who seem to be dealing with it, although Mr Liikanen is taking the lead. Legislation has been brought forward piecemeal. We have already had the novel foods regulation, but this is another part of the jigsaw. We feel that consumers may well be very confused about exactly what the European Union is proposing and how it will impact on them and on the food that they eat and the labels that they read. There is still nothing from the European Commission on the labelling of genetically modified material when it is contained in animal feed and we look forward to proposals on that.  On the whole, the committee received rather conflicting signals about the recommended maximum  1  content level. I really would ask the Commissioner when he replies to the debate to take this opportunity to clarify as publicly as possible why the European Commission has chosen the  1  level.  I understand that the Commission was under considerable pressure to go for a much higher level,  5  was the level which some American interests wanted the Commission to go for. On the other hand, there are some members of the committee who argue that a  0 . 1  level would have been perfectly feasible and pointed out that some supermarket chains around the European Union are insisting on a  0 . 1  level. I believe that the Commissions answer to this is that the  1  level is the only level at which we can be absolutely sure that the testing methods are available so that they can be firmly based in Community law. If that is the case, then how can supermarkets chains argue to us that a  0 . 1  level is perfectly feasible? Are the testing methods available, and what about the supermarkets claims?  The committee was so unhappy about this that it wanted to make absolutely clear to the European Commission that it wants to review of this proposal in short order. I hope that the Commission will comment on the feasibility of this. If the  1  level is found to be perfectly technically feasible, there are many in the Community who want to make sure that it is possible to review that level downwards, and we would like to have the Commissions view on that.  Finally, we turn to the question of enforcement and paragraph  6  of the resolution. Can the Commission state absolutely certainly that it is going to be possible to apply this maximum  1  content level to very small quantities of ingredients? As we read the regulation, it says that the maximum  1  level may apply to ingredients of a product, not necessarily simply to the product as a whole. If that is the case, we are looking at very small quantities indeed, and there are a number of members of the committee who feel that essentially this proposal that we are looking at tonight is unenforceable and represents another occasion where the European Commission has produced something which looks good but which will not actually work out in practice.
1626372 author: Jennifer Cameron:  I would like, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, to warmly congratulate the Finnish Presidency. You have completed a very successful first presidency for Finland but you have done it with a capacity that does enormous credit to the tasks which you addressed.  The Summit has produced a result which is worthy of the times. We are at the end of a century, we are contemplating a new millennium and it is a time of review, a time of outlook and a time of new optimism. I believe, in a certain way, the Summit has captured that. I believe that the major decisions that have been made in respect of enlargement, reform and defence show that there is a sustained vitality in our common European vocation. That is an important message and the central message that has emerged from your successful presidency and on that you deserve rich and proper congratulation.  I should like to say, in respect of enlargement, that my group, as the others too have expressed here today, is extremely pleased to see that negotiations will open soon with the six additional States of Central and Eastern Europe. It is important that we inject a new political dynamic into the enlargement process. The enlargement process itself is essentially a political process and we must not lose sight of that, notwithstanding the many technical dimensions that attend it.  On the question of Turkey: my group welcomes the decision to extend candidate status to Turkey and regards it as positive. We hope that the modernising influences within Turkish politics and society will now take hold of this opportunity and build on it in a positive way. But in welcoming the decision as we do, we insist that those modernising forces must make determined progress towards European norms of respect for human rights and of the relationship between civil and military society; towards the abolition of the death penalty; towards a clear respect for minorities, especially the Kurdish minority in Turkey. The European Union has also made through your presidency a wise choice in insisting that the reform process in the Treaties must be over and operational by the year  2002  so that it will facilitate early accession because it is important to ensure that the reform process should not become the enemy of the enlargement process.  The IGC has the opportunity to enhance efficiency and effectiveness and to deepen the democratic character of the European Union. However, we are disappointed that the IGC agenda which has been contemplated at Helsinki has been limited to what has been described as the Amsterdam leftovers. I accept that these are not merely crumbs on the table, they are significant slices of reform but we must grasp this opportunity to do more. My group, through this House, will work with other parliamentarians and with the Commission to try to convince the incoming Portuguese Presidency to be more ambitious in the reform, all the while respecting the timetable.  I share the view of other colleagues that it is unfortunate to describe the role that this House can play as one merely of observer. I welcome the fact that we will participate but we participate as equals and not merely as observers.  On the question of defence, we warmly welcome the establishment of the rapid reaction force and its significant and necessary progress  Kosovo has taught us dearly the need for that. My group, however, again wishes to stress the importance that this should be seen in the context of a strong Atlantic Alliance. We must not give any succour to the forces in US politics who show a tendency towards isolationism, many of whose voices are now raised in the current US Presidential election.  In this regard, one suggestion is that we contemplate the establishment of a political and security committee and military committee. Could the Defence Minister of the incoming Presidency come to this House at an early date and make a statement to us? We need to clarify a number of things such as the role of EU nonNATO members in such a force and the role of nonEU NATO members in respect of such a force if they wish to participate. This and other issues should have a democratic airing and this is the place to do so at a European level.  A final comment: I could not sit down without mentioning our deep concern about Chechnya. We welcome the fact that this is occupying the attention of Helsinki. We would urge the IMF also to act vigorously in this regard because, although each State has a right to defend itself against terrorism, what we observe in Chechnya is grossly disproportionate to the scale of the perceived threat and we have to deplore and condemn it at every opportunity.
3723441 author: Frederic Green:  Thank you for inviting me to give the Commissions assessment of the results of the Bonn Conference on Climate Change.  One year ago the parties to the Convention on Climate Change decided on a twoyear work programme, the Buenos Aires plan of action. It should lead to decisions on the outstanding issues under the Kyoto Protocol by COP  6 , which will take place one year from now in The Hague. In this context the expectations for Bonn concentrated on the need to make substantial technical progress. It was clear from the outset that the major political decisions would have to wait for COP  6 . I believe such progress has been achieved.  The aspect of COP  5  of greatest political importance was Chancellor Schroeders call for entry into force of the Protocol by the year  2002 . I am very pleased that the European Union, along with many other parties, expressed its support for that idea. This means that a clear timetable is now set which increases the pressure on all parties to make COP  6  a success. I urge all parties to ensure that they are able to launch the ratification process immediately after COP  6 . In this context, the decision of the parties in Bonn to speed up the process during the coming years was important.  Allow me to comment on some of the issues that were discussed in Bonn. The most important unresolved issues under the Kyoto Protocol are the rules and modalities for the Kyoto mechanisms and the design of a comprehensive compliant system. The Kyoto mechanisms  emissions trading, joint implementation and the clean development mechanism  are a part of the Protocol.  It is generally recognised that they have the potential to make climate action more cost efficient. Of course, it is vital that such a system is complemented by a strictly compliant system including provisions for cases of noncompliance.  In view of the difficult international negotiation process, it was quite a success that, on the Kyoto mechanisms and on compliance, we succeeded in getting de facto draft negotiating texts. These will continue to constitute the basis for further negotiation in the coming months. Without this achievement, the prospects of reaching decisions at COP  6  would have been bleak.  Good progress has also been made on issues such as capacity building, technology transfer and adaptation to the effects of climate change. The meeting highlighted once again how important it is to make equal progress on issues of importance to the industrialised world as much as to the developing countries. That is why we need a balanced process between issues relating to the Kyoto Protocol and issues relating to the underlying Climate Change Convention.  We have to keep in mind that COP  6  can be successful only if we can deliver significant results on both issues, building a bridge between the industrialised and developing countries.  Another success was the continuation of the socalled activities implemented jointly. These projects financed by industrial countries cannot but enhance capacity building and technology transfer in developing countries and economies in transition.  This brings me to a very important matter that Parliament has also raised in a resolution, namely the question of nuclear energy as an option for clean development mechanism projects. I am of the opinion that the environmental and safety problems surrounding nuclear energy are too important to encourage its proliferation in developing countries under the header of the clean development mechanism. There are excellent alternatives such as renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures that fit much better with the purpose of the CDM to promote sustainable development.  Let me turn to some of the other divergence issues. The EU proposal for a concrete ceiling on the use of the Kyoto mechanisms has not been addressed formally at COP  5  but was very much the subject of discussion in the corridors.  The intentions underlying the proposals stand as firm as ever, guaranteeing that every party achieves at least a substantial part of its emissions target at home instead of relying heavily on the Kyoto mechanisms. This should allow the first behavioural and technological changes with a view to preparing for the much more ambitious emission cuts of the future.  In addition, the Kyoto targets must be achieved through real emission reductions and not by buying other countries quotas that have become overgenerous due to economic decline  the famous hot air. Hence the need to limit the amount of its quota of emissions that a party can sell. A decision on how to ensure this environmental soundness must be taken at COP  6  as part of the overall package of decisions and the Communitys position on the ceilings issue has not changed.  Another important feature at COP  5  concerned the voluntary commitments of developing countries and it is commendable that developing countries such as Argentina and Kazakhstan are taking the initiative to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. In view of their economic growth prospects their involvement in international climate change action is of the utmost importance. However, it is crucial that we get the process right. We must avoid inflation of the environmental permits available in the Kyoto mechanisms as this would work against real emission reductions.  I hope to come back to you in a year or so to report positive results from COP  6 . In the meantime the Commission will continue not only its active role in the negotiations but also its work on Community measures. Under the climate change action programme, which I announced in this House in October, the Commissions work is currently focusing on the establishment of a list of priority measures in the area of climate change to be presented to the Environment Council in March. I am also working hard to have a Green Paper on emissions trading within the European Community adopted by the Commission in March. It will allow a wide debate of all stakeholders on an approach which should further reduce the costs to our economies of reducing greenhouse gases.  A tremendous amount of technical and political work still lies ahead of us in putting the Kyoto Protocol into effect as a first step in fighting global warming. I appreciate your commitment to help in conveying the importance of combating climate change throughout Europe and to your counterparts in other countries, in particular the United States Congress.
3338848 author: Helen MacLeod:  This weekend I will be travelling to Macao to represent the Commission at the handover ceremonies. As honourable Members might imagine, there is a certain sense of dj vu for me in all of this. Some might say that I am becoming rather an aficionado of handover ceremonies. I have been referred to by some as the last Governor but that has never actually been true. Certainly, my great friend and former colleague, Vasco Rocha Vieira, has more claim to the title than I do.  In making this statement this morning I want to place on record my admiration for all he has done in Macao in his long tenure as Governor. His distinguished record as a public servant of skill and integrity is, I am sure, recognised in his own country as it is in Macao, and in this Parliament as it is in the Commission. I am much looking forward to being able this weekend to salute that service as my gubernatorial colleague leaves his office.  Macao, like Hong Kong before it, will begin a new era after  19  December as a special administrative region of the Peoples Republic of China. It will be different but, in crucial respects, life must and will stay the same. That is what is meant by the concept of one country  two systems under which Macao, like Hong Kong, will retain its freedoms and fundamental rights and enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region of the Peoples Republic of China. Those rights and freedoms, as the Presidency said a few moments ago, are set out in terms in the SinoPortuguese Joint Declaration which both parties have solemnly pledged to uphold.  The European Union will continue to take a close interest in Macao after  19  December. The Commission has recently published a communication entitled The European Union and Macao beyond  2000 . The Council endorsed the communication last week and welcomed and reinforced the commitments it makes. In particular, the communication underlines the central importance we attach to the full implementation of the joint declaration. It makes clear that, as in the case of Hong Kong, the Commission will take a close interest in this matter and  again as we do for Hong Kong  we will publish an annual report on Macao. We will follow the implementation of international conventions of which Macao is a member, in particular the UN Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural rights.  We also intend to work to strengthen EUMacao relations, notably by encouraging EU companies to continue to invest in the territory. The trade and cooperation agreement between the European Community and Macao, signed in  1992 , will remain in force. The Commission welcomes the accreditation of a Macao economic and trade office to the European Communities. It will help to maintain and reinforce our dialogue on trade, economic and cooperation issues.  I feel strongly, as honourable Members will understand, about our continuing interest in Macao, about our continuing obligation. We want to have as good a relationship with the future chief executive of the special administrative region as we have had with my friend the present Governor. I would like to invite the chief executive to pay an early visit to Brussels; and it would also be good to welcome the chief executive of the Hong Kong special administration here when he can manage it or, alternatively, his internationally renowned deputy.  What is happening in Macao next Sunday is an important moment in Portugals history, in Chinas history, in Europes history.  Portugal, like the country I know best  or used to know best  has done its own best to discharge the responsibilities bequeathed by history honourably and well. We all have to take account of different circumstances, of different challenges; nothing is ever quite the same. But when I was in Hong Kong I always felt that when I talked to my colleague across the Pearl River Delta I was working with someone who shared my values and who had a profound sense of duty.  We all run our course. Portugal has run her course in Macao and is fortunate that her honour during this passage has been in the hands of Governor Vieira and his officials in the Government of Macao.
3341106 author: Alastair Corless:  All the European Member States adopted the Beijing Platform for Action. We committed ourselves to  12  areas. They are all indispensable for womens full enjoyment of their human rights. Five years later it is time for an evaluation.  The first area is poverty. We pledged to adopt macroeconomic policies for the needs of women in poverty and to ensure womens equal access to economic resources. But single mothers and older women remain the main victims of poverty.  The second area is education. We promised to ensure womens equal access to science and technology and lifelong education. Unfortunately, education of women and men still follows a stereotyped pattern.  The third area is health. We agreed to increase resources for womens health. Yet middleaged and elderly women remain beset, more than men, with health problems. Maternity and child mortality are still too high.  The fourth area is violence. We promised to eliminate genderbased violence, yet violence against women remains the single largest injury to European women. Between  15  and  25  of women are battered during pregnancy and sexual trafficking is increasing, while only  2  to  3  of those men who commit rape go to prison.  The fifth area is armed conflict. We promised to increase womens participation in conflict resolution and protect women in armed conflicts, yet women still make up the overwhelming majority of those affected by armed conflict but are absent from peace negotiations and peace transition initiatives.  The sixth area is women and the economy. We pledged to promote womens access to employment and control over economic resources. Women remain virtually absent from or are poorly represented in economic decision making. Women earn, on average,  75  of the hourly wages of men and their employment rate is about  20  lower.  Decision making is the seventh area. We promised to ensure womens equal access to, and full participation in, power structures and decision making, yet nowhere is the gap between de jure and de facto gender equality greater than in the area of decision making.  The eighth area is institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women. We agreed to mainstream gender in legislation, public policies and programmes. Unfortunately, the political will has been absent. Gender mainstreaming and gender impact assessment are far from a reality.  Womens human rights is the ninth area. We promised to fully implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Today there is still insufficient recognition of the principle that human rights apply equally to women and men.  The tenth area is media. We pledged to promote a nonstereotyped portrayal of women in the media yet, as a result of massive male domination of media power, the media continue to project negative and degrading images of women.  The eleventh area is environment. The European Members pledged to involve women actively in environmental decision making. Womens experience and skill remain insufficiently used in environmental policy actions.  The twelfth and last area is the girl child. We promised to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child, yet statistics show that a girl child is discriminated against from the earliest stages of life, through her childhood and into adulthood.  This is the discouraging result five years after Beijing and after  25  years of effort since the United Nations incurred the responsibility for promoting womens rights at national, regional and international levels. It is high time for the UN Beijing plus five special session in June next year to take concrete action to implement the Beijing platform. An actionoriented plan for advancing the Beijing goals is necessary if all governments are to implement strategies for gender equality in all  12  critical areas of concern.  The European Union must play a truly active role. The preparatory work at European level is already far advanced. The European Union work must be speeded up so it can have a real influence before positions are fixed at international level. Our question is: how will the Commission and the Council ensure that Parliament becomes a real partner, both in the preparatory work on the European Union input to Beijing plus five, and in the European Unions official delegation to the New York Conference?
535680 author: Lynne Green:  I would like to begin with a word of apology on behalf of my colleague David Byrne. Unfortunately, owing to the cancellation of the morning flight from Brussels to Strasbourg due to exceptionally adverse weather conditions, he is not able to be here in person. I will therefore speak to you instead on the important issue of the Commission action in relation to the continued refusal of France to lift its ban on imports of British beef.  Commissioner Byrne will, however, be arriving in Strasbourg later this afternoon, and will be in a position to take any questions when he speaks on the draft regulation on the labelling of beef products. He will also be happy to meet interested Members of Parliament individually or as a group to discuss the issue further. In these unavoidable circumstances I am only in a position to deliver Commissioner Byrnes script on his behalf.  The Commission yesterday, as you are already aware, adopted a decision to issue a formal reasoned opinion to the French authorities over their continued refusal to lift their national restrictions on imports of British beef. The French authorities have five working days to reply to this letter. In the absence of a decision to lift the ban, the case will be filed with the European Court of Justice.  The failure to resolve the dispute in an amicable manner is a huge disappointment to the Commission. I think it fair to add that it is a disappointment to all the parties concerned, given the huge efforts that went into finding a solution without recourse to legal action. The Commission has always made clear its preference to solve this dispute without legal intervention. This approach is in the interests of all parties. I would add that it is especially in the interests of the parties most affected  British beef producers. The reality is that legal action to lift the ban is likely to be a lengthy process, very much a secondbest solution as compared to an amicable agreement.  The Commissions efforts focused on establishing that the original decision to lift the ban on UK beef posed no threat to public health. The decision was based on a series of important safeguards which were firmly rooted in scientific advice. They also followed the orientations of the European Council in Florence in June  1996  on the procedures, timetable and safeguards required to lift the ban.  Unfortunately, the French authorities, on the advice of their National Food Safety Authority, AFSSA, were still unprepared to lift their national restrictions. The Commission took the precaution of referring to its Scientific Steering Committee these concerns for an opinion on whether they called into question the decision to lift the ban and the terms of the datebased export scheme in particular.  The unanimous opinion of the SSC that there is no need to review the decision to lift the ban on UK beef exports was hugely reassuring in this respect. Unfortunately, however, this reassurance did not prove sufficient to allow the French authorities to lift their ban.  Efforts have subsequently focused on additional reassurances and clarifications on the provisions of the datebased export scheme.  These efforts led to the agreement between the UK, France and the Commission on a memorandum of understanding on  23  November, which provided the reassurances and clarifications required. It is fair to say there was an expectation that this memo would prove to be the key to lifting the French embargo.  The opinion of AFFSA on the memo, however, again did not prove sufficient for the French authorities to lift the ban. On  9  December they officially informed the Commission of this decision. This, in turn, has led the Commission to adopt a reasoned opinion yesterday.  There have been criticisms that the Commissions efforts to resolve the dispute in a diplomatic manner were a waste of time and effort. The argument, instead, is that the Commission should have immediately resorted to legal action. These criticisms are unfounded, and are indeed dangerous. As I pointed out earlier, they are especially contrary to the interests of the most affected party, British beef producers. These criticisms also ignore the very determined action the Commission has taken to uphold its treaty obligations to ensure compliance with Community law.  In effect, the Commission has adopted a carrot and stick approach: the carrot was the very intensive effort to bring the parties together and to get them to agree a solution through negotiation. The stick, on the other hand, was to take action when it was clear that these efforts were not proving sufficient. It is useful to bear in mind that the Commissions letter of formal notice issued on  16  November allowed a period of only two weeks for reply, rather than the normal two months. Similarly, the reasoned opinion adopted yesterday also allows five days for reply rather than the normal two months. In effect, therefore, there has been no slippage in the legal calendar in ensuring compliance with the decision to lift the ban on exports of UK beef.  The intervening period has also served to provide muchneeded reassurances and guarantees that the original decision to lift the ban was soundly based. In particular it has established that the scientific basis for lifting the ban was sound.  I am sure that if we are ever to find an amicable solution to this dispute, which I hope can still be found, it will have been due to the efforts which took place over the past several weeks.  Thank you for your attention. Once more let me apologise on Commissioner Byrnes behalf that he is not here in person, but he will be available to take questions later.
2321903 author: Katarina Cameron:  I would like to commend this second reading to the House. It is very much about prosperity, and about creating jobs in the European Union, particularly for our small and mediumsized enterprises, by creating a better business climate for those businesses.  Paradoxically, I do not want this report to be used. In fact I would like to see it go out of fashion very quickly indeed. This sort of Directive should be changing the climate of our business economy, away from late payment to prompt payment. We actually want a culture in this European Union, in our single market, of prompt payment, not late payment.  I would like to place on record a number of thanks before I address the substance of our second reading: thanks to Parliaments services for working so quickly on this report; to the Commission for all its support; and to the Finnish Presidency for the courteous and careful advice it has given through this process. Thanks also to colleagues on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy with whom I have worked very closely, several of whom I see here in this Chamber this evening. In particular, thanks to UEAPME who are very much the voice of small businesses in the European Union and who have given wholehearted support to this proposal.  One further vote of thanks is also due, and that is actually to a ghost of this Chamber: that is, to my former colleague and good friend Lyndon Harrison, who was rapporteur at first reading, now Lord Harrison of Chester. It was Lyndon Harrison who, as rapporteur on  16  September  1998 , said to this House: It is time to outlaw cheating practices and give small and mediumsized enterprises the confidence to go boldly into the single European market knowing that they will be paid on time and in full. I could not agree more.  I have to say, from our position as a Parliament, that the Councils common position was a disappointment  especially when you consider that we share the same aim. Yet because we share the same aim, and because there is goodwill on both sides, I am confident that we will have an effective and efficient directive that will eventually be adopted.  However, it is important to point out that there are large areas of difference between us. These include the rate of statutory interest to be charged when a late payment occurs; the length of the trigger period for interest if no contract has actually stipulated a payment period; retention of title in the course of late payment; the role of the public sector and the treatment of public procurement; and compensation claims arising from late payment. All these areas are very difficult and could cause problems between Parliament and Council. Nevertheless, it is my belief that they are integral to our aim and are broadly safe and sound, and will help create a better business climate for small and mediumsized enterprises as they develop to realise their full potential within the single market.  Shortly after I was elected to this House, Mr President, one of my first pleasurable duties was to bring to the Parliament representatives from Dudley Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which was then in my constituency. They came to a hearing on late payments that was being organised in the Parliament and gave some very good expert advice, recognising that we had problems with late payment in the single market. Those problems have actually got worse, which is why we currently have a directive and a proposal before us this evening. The importance of this directive is that it will help us address that business climate, to have a cultural change so that we move away from late payment to prompt payment as the norm within the European single market and not, as it currently is, the other way around.  The small and mediumsized enterprises of the European Union are watching very closely to see how we react to this particular proposal and the common position. They will expect from this House tomorrow a strong vote backing the vote that was carried in the Industry Committee unanimously on Monday of this week. With those opening remarks, Mr President, I would commend our position to you.
4892350 author: Annette Cameron:  Let me begin with a word of apology for my delayed arrival this afternoon. Unfortunately, weather conditions in Brussels led to the cancellation of this mornings flight and therefore I was unable to be present in person to update Parliament on the BSE dispute. This has led I know to a change in the schedule of Parliamentary business with this important debate now taking place late in the evening. I have been informed of all the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this proposal. I would like to congratulate Mr Papayannakis, the rapporteur, and Mr Kindermann, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.  The business before us is the Commission proposal to extend the existing voluntary labelling requirements under Regulation (EC) No  82097  for a further year. I am very aware that Parliament is deeply unhappy that a compulsory labelling regime is not in place as envisaged with effect from  1  January  2000 . I note that there is a proposed amendment which criticises the Commission and certain Member States for this delay. However there were good and justifiable reasons for this delay. Firstly, Member States did not submit the required reports on existing arrangements in sufficient time. Secondly, not all Member States will be in a position to establish reliable registration and identification systems for all animals. Finally, the last Commission took a decision, following its resignation, not to present any major new political initiatives and I understand that Parliament agreed with that proposal.  This Commission was therefore faced with a very difficult situation. There was a very tight deadline,  1  January  2000 , within which to agree a proposal laying down general rules for a compulsory system to apply from that date. Quite simply, with the best will in the world, this deadline cannot be met. The proposal has been made under the codecision procedure but full agreement between the Community institutions cannot be expected for several months. This is the minimum time necessary to agree such important issues.  In these circumstances, the Commission also presented a second proposal to prolong the existing voluntary arrangements provided for under Regulation (EC) No  82097 . This is also in accordance with the codecision procedure. It therefore is also confronted with the very pressing deadline of  1  January  2000 . The challenge is to reach full agreement within the next week or so.  Yesterday the Council discussed this second Commission proposal for a prolongation of the existing regime. The Council agreed an orientation on this proposal with only one amendment  the addition of Article  37  alongside Article  152   to the legal base. This is, of course, a major amendment which, in my opinion, does not favour a quick conclusion to the codecision procedure. Any amendment by Parliament to the Commissions proposal, which is contrary to the orientation agreed by the Council yesterday is equally certain to block any progress towards agreement before the end of this year.  This puts both the Parliament and the Commission in a very difficult situation. You will be very aware of the implications. In these circumstances, the Commission has a responsibility to act. As already signalled, the Commission would be obliged, in order to avoid a legal void, to present a third proposal. This third proposal would be based on Article  19  of the existing Regulation (EC) No  82097  and would prolong the existing arrangements providing for voluntary labelling.  My intention would be to examine carefully your amendments with a view to seeing in what measure they can be considered. On this point I must underline that certain amendments which aim to shorten delays go in the direction of improved consumer protection, which of course is an issue that is close to my heart. I can in this context accept amendments which aim to shorten the period during which the existing arrangements can continue for a period of eight months.  However, I cannot accept your amendments concerning bringing forward the labelling of place of slaughter with effect from  1  January  2000 . I have a lot of sympathy for this amendment and signal to the Council a strong wish to have it considered in their common position. Indeed, yesterday in Council I drew the Councils attention to the fact that there was an amendment put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on Monday. However, there was virtually no support. It is also a provision which would perhaps be better addressed in the main proposal on the general rules. This proposal is also currently before the Council and Parliament.  The Commission cannot accept the proposed amendment to drop the requirement for real debate between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the main proposal based on Article  152  of the Treaty. This would be the consequence if this amendment is adopted: Parliament would give up its important obligation to participate in this debate.  I should like to add that the debate is still open in relation to the Commission proposal on the general rules applying an obligatory regime. It is in this context that the main debate should take place. It is unfortunate that discussions of these very complex and important issues have had to take place in the context of an emergency decision with a nearimpossible deadline.  The Commission is of the view that Article  152  is the appropriate legal base. This is an extremely important and contested issue which is currently before the Court of Justice. On this question the Commission cannot agree to the addition of Article  37 .  There is little or no appetite in the Member States for a fully compulsory system from  1  January  2000 . We cannot ignore this reality, nor can we assume that we have a better idea of the obligations involved than the Member States. Member States can choose to impose compulsory labelling for beef cattle born, raised and slaughtered on their own territory. Only three have chosen to do so.  The Commission is in favour of full, compulsory labelling. It is therefore proposed that it should take place from  1  January  2001  for place of slaughter and, in addition, from  1  January  2003  for place of birth and fattening. I can assure you that I am committed to this particular proposal and to the question of compulsory labelling. It is my intention to pursue that in the period of time I am in office, and to do so quickly.  Turning to some of the questions that were raised by some of you, I will try to give you some answers in relation to these issues.  In relation to the question raised by Mr Papayannakis when he said: You are trying to fool us here. I am not sure if the interpreters made some kind of mistake. I would like to place a benign interpretation on those words rather than a malign one, because they are open to the interpretation that I am attempting to mislead Parliament. That, as you know, Mr Papayannakis, is one of the most serious charges that can be laid against anybody. If that was your intention I reject it and resent it. I have always been open with Parliament. On the first day I came here, when I spoke at my hearings in September, I made it absolutely clear that it was my intention to be open and transparent with Parliament. I have appeared in Parliament in plenary session on many occasions in the short time that I have been Commissioner. I have appeared before committees of this House on a number of occasions also. Never once in that period of time was any such suggestion made to me. I do not accept it.
8266702 author: Sebastian Bauer:  Mr President, I would like to thank all those who took part in this debate, which I found worthwhile both from a political and a cultural point of view. I would like to assure the participants in the debate that the Commission, and myself personally, attach a lot of importance, as you do, to culture and books, and we recognise the cultural importance of books and are ready to take into account these specific features. Mr Karas mentioned that I have already stated that I wish competition policy to be an element of the social market economy: I confirm this and ask you all not to consider competition as an abstract concept and the citizens enemy.  Competition is the main ally of individual citizens. Competition s main aim is to safeguard consumer interests from the point of view both of prices and quality, as well as to safeguard small and mediumsized businesses against the excesses of large businesses, in many cases. For this reason, just as I am prepared to give full recognition to the importance of culture, I am asking you not to become intellectual victims of an approach whereby competition is not a major ally of citizens. The task of competition is to combat cartels, the abuse of dominant positions and mergers, and to create more possibilities for economic freedom, and we know that economic freedom is often accompanied by civil freedom too, as shown by the past experience of countries which did not have economic freedom. I therefore believe that there is room for a harmonious interaction between cultural policy and competition policy, without creating futile and forced counterstances.  The evidence provided by Lord Inglewood, which can be found in other countries as well, shows that the abolition of a fixed price system does not necessarily bring about disruptive consequences in terms of prices and quality of books. Yet I want it to be very clear that the Commission is not working for the abolition of fixed price systems for books as such. Frankly, Mrs Juncker, I wonder whether you and I were in the same room when I spoke because I am very surprised that you say that the Commission wants to eliminate the price maintenance system. May I repeat literally what I said in Italian:  The Commission believes that national systems of fixed book prices, based on agreements between companies, are compatible with Community competition rules if they do not significantly affect trade between Member States. I also said: As for systems based on regulations  that is, the other possibility, not agreements but regulations  each Member State is free to adopt regulations as long as they are compatible with the principle, sanctioned by the Treaty, of the free movement of goods . Therefore, please, let us not depict the Commission as an institution which sets out to do things that in reality it has no intention of doing. I have repeatedly said that we will not oppose, nor can we oppose, fixed book price systems at national level. We must only prevent telling distortions arising from the fact that this is a crossborder issue.  I have already said, as regards the specific GermanAustrian case, where proceedings are ongoing, that unfortunately I cannot discuss it in detail here. I can, however, assure you that I made an enormous effort, in my first three months in office, to meet the parties concerned and pinpoint prospects for a positive outcome. In this respect, I found Mr Langen s intervention constructive, as he seems to recognise that such a prospect exists.  (EN) Finally, Mrs Echerer reminded us all in this room that we have different backgrounds. She is right. Unfortunately, my background is not that of an actor. I would not dare to define myself as a man of culture, far from it, but I spent my life until five years ago as a university professor and my life has been spent between books as an instrument for work and they are something I deeply respect and love. I believe I am as sensitive as anybody here to the importance of books, of culture. It is simply my job to try to preserve all the positive values that are embedded in them, avoiding at the same time some excesses that may be to the detriment of the reader.  Thank you very much for your attention.
